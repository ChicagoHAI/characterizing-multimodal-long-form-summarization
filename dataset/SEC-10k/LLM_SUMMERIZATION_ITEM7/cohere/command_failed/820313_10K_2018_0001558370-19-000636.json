Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(amounts in millions, except share and per share data, unless otherwise noted)\nThe following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, herein. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in U.S. dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). The following discussion and analysis also includes references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section below, including Constant Currency Net Sales Growth\u201d and Organic Net Sales Growth\u201d. For purposes of the following discussion, the terms constant currencies\u201d and organically\u201d have the same meanings as these aforementioned non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d within this Item 7 for more information, including our reasons for including non-GAAP financial measures and material limitations with respect to the usefulness of the measures.\nIn addition to historical information, the following discussion and analysis also contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the risk factors described in Item 1A herein, as well as the risks and uncertainties that exist with the use of forward-looking statements as described in the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d section included herein at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nGeneral\nThe Company is one of the world's largest designers, manufacturers and marketers of electrical, electronic and fiber optic connectors, interconnect systems, antennas, sensors and sensor-based products and coaxial and high-speed specialty cable. The Company operates through two reporting segments: (i) Interconnect Products and Assemblies and (ii) Cable Products and Solutions. In 2018, approximately 73% of the Company's sales were outside the United States. The primary end markets for our products are:\nTable 106: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ninformation technology and communication devices and systems for the converging technologies of voice, video and data communications;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\na broad range of industrial applications and traditional and hybrid-electric automotive applications; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncommercial aerospace and military applications.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers. The Company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time. There has been a trend on the part of customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have the ability to meet certain technical, quality, delivery and other standards while maintaining competitive prices. The Company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment. The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers.\nStrategy\nThe Company's strategy is to provide its customers with comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service on a worldwide basis while maintaining continuing programs of productivity improvement and cost control. The Company focuses its research and development efforts through close collaboration with its customers to develop highly-engineered products that meet customer needs and have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one- to three-year period. The Company is also focused on controlling costs. The Company does this by investing in modern manufacturing technologies, controlling purchasing processes and expanding into lower cost areas.\nThe Company's strategic objective is to further enhance its position in its served markets by pursuing the following success factors:\nTable 109: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPursue broad diversification;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDevelop performance-enhancing interconnect solutions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nExpand global presence;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nControl costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPursue strategic acquisitions and investments; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFoster collaborative, entrepreneurial management.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2018, the Company reported net sales, operating income and net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation of $8,202.0, $1,686.9 and $1,205.0, respectively, up 17%, 18% and 85%, respectively, from 2017. In 2018, the Company's net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation was impacted by the recognition of an income tax benefit of $14.5 related to the completion of the accounting for the Tax Act Charge (defined below) in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the recognition of excess tax benefits of $19.8 from stock option exercises, partially offset by acquisition-related expenses incurred during the year. In 2017, the Company's net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation was impacted by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017 which resulted in a provisional income tax charge of $398.5 as discussed in more detail below and in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements within this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in addition to the impact of the acquisition-related expenses incurred during the year, partially offset by the excess tax benefits of $66.6 recognized from stock option exercises. Excluding the effects of these items, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, as defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section below and as reconciled in Part II, Item 6 and Item 7 herein, increased by 18% and 19%, respectively, in 2018. Sales and profitability trends are discussed in detail in Results of Operations\u201d below. In addition, a strength of the Company has been its ability to consistently generate cash from operations. The Company uses cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, repurchase shares of its common stock, pay dividends and reduce indebtedness. In 2018, the Company generated operating cash flow of $1,112.7.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\nOn December 22, 2017, the United States federal government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Tax Act\u201d), marking a change from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax system in the United States. As part of this change, the Tax Act, among other changes, provides for a transition tax on the accumulated unremitted foreign earnings and profits of the Company's foreign subsidiaries ( Transition Tax\u201d) and a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded an income tax charge of $398.5 ( Tax Act Charge\u201d) that was comprised of (i) the Transition Tax of $259.4, (ii) a charge of $176.6 related to changes in the Company's permanent reinvestment assertion with regards to prior accumulated unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by (iii) a tax benefit of $37.5 associated with the remeasurement of the Company's U.S. net deferred tax liabilities due to the U.S. federal corporate tax rate reduction. As discussed under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates within this Item 7, the three components of the Tax Act Charge were provisional amounts recorded in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d). SAB 118, which is now codified under ASU 2018-05, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, addresses the application of U.S. GAAP in situations where a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. Due to the timing of the Tax Act's enactment and the complexity of its provisions, the Company had not completed its accounting for the impact of the Tax Act as of December 31, 2017. The Company analyzed guidance and technical interpretations issued in 2018 related to the provisions of the Tax Act, and refined, analyzed and updated the underlying data, computations and assumptions used to prepare the Tax Act Charge. As a result, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $14.5 in 2018 related to the completion of the accounting for the Tax Act Charge.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth the components of net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation as a percentage of net sales for the years indicated.\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCost of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n67.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n67.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n67.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAcquisition-related expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n19.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n19.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n19.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProvision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(9.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0.1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income attributable to Amphenol Corporation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 Compared to 2017\nNet sales were $8,202.0 for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $7,011.3 for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 17% in both U.S. dollars and constant currencies and 14% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts) over the prior year. Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 95% of net sales) increased 18% in U.S. dollars, 17% in constant currencies and 14% organically in 2018, compared to 2017. The sales growth was driven by growth in the mobile devices, industrial, automotive, information technology and data communications, military, mobile networks and commercial aerospace markets, partially offset by a slight decline in sales into the broadband communications market, with growth resulting primarily from organic strength, in addition to contributions from the Company's acquisitions. Net sales to the mobile devices market increased (approximately $403.6) primarily due to growth in sales of products incorporated into smartphones and related accessories, partially offset by declining sales of products incorporated into tablets. Net sales to the industrial market increased (approximately $214.9), reflecting sales strength in medical, heavy equipment, electric vehicle, railway and mass transit, and oil and gas, as well as contributions from acquisitions. Net sales to the automotive market increased (approximately $184.9), driven by growth and expansion in most regions of the global automotive market, as well as contributions from acquisitions. Net sales to the information technology and data communications market increased (approximately $166.1), reflecting organic growth in products for data centers, including server and networking-related applications, storage, and consumer electronics. Net sales to the military market increased (approximately $133.2), driven by broad strength across the market including increased sales into avionics, military communications and military airframe applications, as well as missile applications. Net sales to the mobile networks market increased (approximately $56.3), due to increased sales to both mobile networks equipment manufacturers and mobile operators. Net sales to the commercial aerospace market increased (approximately $39.6) primarily due to strength in large passenger planes. Net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 5% of net sales), which primarily serves the broadband communications market, increased 4% in U.S. dollars, 6% in constant currencies and 6% organically in 2018, compared to 2017. The increase in the Cable Products and Solutions segment was primarily due to an increase in cable products sold into the mobile networks market, which was partially offset by the slight decrease in sales into the broadband communications market.\nThe table below reconciles Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, by segment and consolidated, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017:\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercentage Growth (relative to prior year)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNet sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nForeign\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nConstant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOrganic\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ngrowth in\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncurrency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCurrency Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAcquisition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNet Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nU.S. Dollars (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nimpact (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSales Growth (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nimpact (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nGrowth (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet sales:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterconnect Products and Assemblies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,781.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,606.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCable Products and Solutions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n420.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n404.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nConsolidated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n8,202.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,011.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNet sales growth in U.S. dollars is calculated based on Net sales as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Note 11 of the accompanying financial statements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nForeign currency translation impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from foreign currency exchange rate changes in the current year compared to the prior year.

Foreign sales in 2018 increased approximately 18% in U.S. dollars ($5,960.6 in 2018 versus $5,032.9 in 2017), 17% in constant currencies and 15% organically, compared to 2017 with strength in both Asia and Europe. The comparatively slightly weaker U.S. dollar in 2018 had an insignificant effect on net sales compared to 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $959.5 or 11.7% of net sales for 2018, compared to $878.3 or 12.5% of net sales for 2017. Administrative expenses increased approximately $46.4 in 2018 primarily related to increases in employee-related benefits and stock-based compensation expense, and represented approximately 4.7% of net sales in 2018 and 4.8% of net sales in 2017. Research and development expenses increased approximately $27.2 in 2018 primarily related to increases in expenses for new product development and represented approximately 2.7% of net sales in 2018 and 2.8% of net sales in 2017. Selling and marketing expenses increased approximately $7.6 in 2018 primarily related to the increase in sales volume and represented approximately 4.3% of net sales in 2018 and 4.9% of net sales in 2017.\nOperating income was $1,686.9 or 20.6% of net sales in 2018, compared to $1,427.6 or 20.4% of net sales in 2017. Operating income for 2018 and 2017 includes acquisition-related expenses of $8.5 and $4.0, respectively, related to external transaction costs. These acquisition-related expenses are separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, as defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section below, were $1,695.4 or 20.7% of net sales in 2018 and $1,431.6 or 20.4% in 2017. The increase in Adjusted Operating Margin for 2018 compared to 2017 was driven primarily by an increase in operating margin for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment in 2018 was $1,752.5 or 22.5% of net sales, compared to $1,475.2 or 22.3% of net sales in 2017. The increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by strong operating leverage on higher sales volumes. In addition, the operating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2018 was $52.6 or 12.5% of net sales, compared to $54.2 or 13.4% of net sales in 2017. The decrease in operating income margin for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by increases in certain commodity costs.\nInterest expense was $101.7 in 2018 compared to $92.3 in 2017. The increase is primarily due to higher average interest rates on the Company's U.S. Commercial Paper Program (as defined below in this Item 7) and the senior note issuances in April 2017.\nProvision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 23.4% in 2018 and 51.1% in 2017. The lower effective tax rate in 2018 compared to 2017 resulted primarily from the Tax Act Charge of $398.5 recorded in 2017, which was partially offset by the excess tax benefits of $66.6 from stock option exercises. The effects of these items were significantly lower in 2018, as the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $14.5 in 2018 related to the completion\nof the accounting for the Tax Act Charge, along with the excess tax benefits of $19.8 from stock option exercises. Excluding the effect of these items along with the effect of acquisition-related expenses in each respective year, the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section below, was 25.5% and 26.5% for 2018 and 2017, respectively, as reconciled in the table below to the comparable effective tax rate based on GAAP results. For additional details related to the reconciliation between the U.S. statutory federal tax rate and the Company's effective tax rate for these years, refer to Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNet income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Net income per common share-Diluted ( Diluted EPS\u201d) was $1,205.0 and $3.85, respectively, for 2018, compared to $650.5 and $2.06, respectively, for 2017. Excluding the effect of the aforementioned (a) Tax Act Charge in 2017 and the subsequent adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018, (b) excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in 2018 and 2017 and (c) the acquisition-related expenses incurred in both years, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Adjusted Diluted EPS, as defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section below within this Item 7, were $1,177.9 and $3.77, respectively, for 2018, compared to $986.1 and $3.12, respectively, for 2017.\nThe following table reconciles

Compared to 2016\nNet sales were $7,011.3 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $6,286.4 for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 12% in both U.S. dollars and constant currencies and 8% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts) over the prior year. Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 94% of net sales) increased 12% in both U.S. dollars and constant currencies and 9% organically in 2017, compared to 2016. The sales growth was driven primarily by growth in the industrial, automotive, information technology and data communications, mobile devices, military and commercial aerospace markets, with contributions from both organic strength as well as from the Company's acquisitions, partially offset by a slight decline in sales in the mobile networks market. Net sales to the industrial market increased (approximately $244.4), reflecting sales strength in heavy equipment, industrial instrumentation, oil and gas, and factory automation as well as contributions from acquisitions. Net sales to the automotive market increased (approximately $177.0), driven by growth and expansion in all regions of the global automotive market, as well as contributions from acquisitions. Net sales to the information technology and data communications market increased (approximately $115.0), reflecting organic growth in products for data centers, including server and networking-related applications. Net sales to the mobile devices market increased (approximately $101.1) primarily due to growth in sales of products incorporated into smartphones and related accessories, partially offset by declining sales of products incorporated into tablets. Net sales to the military market increased (approximately $77.8), driven by broad strength across substantially all segments of the market including increased sales into military communications and military airframe applications, as well as missile applications. Net sales to the commercial aerospace market slightly increased (approximately $9.9) primarily due to the contributions from acquisitions as well as strength in large passenger planes, partially offset by continued weakness in demand for business\njets and helicopters. Net sales to the mobile networks market decreased (approximately $20.3), primarily due to reduced overall capital spending by mobile operators. Net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 6% of net sales), which is primarily in the broadband communications market, increased 11% in U.S. dollars and 10% in constant currencies in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to contributions from an acquisition made during the second half of 2016.\nThe table below reconciles Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, by segment and consolidated, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016:\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercentage Growth (relative to prior year)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNet sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nForeign\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nConstant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOrganic\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ngrowth in\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncurrency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCurrency Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAcquisition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNet Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nU.S. Dollars (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nimpact (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSales Growth (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nimpact (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nGrowth (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet sales:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterconnect Products and Assemblies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,606.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5,922.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCable Products and Solutions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n404.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n364.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nConsolidated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,011.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,286.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNet sales growth in U.S. dollars is calculated based on Net sales as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Note 11 of the accompanying financial statements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nForeign currency translation impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from foreign currency exchange rate changes in the current year compared to the prior year.

Foreign sales in 2017 increased approximately 11% in U.S. dollars ($5,032.9 in 2017 versus $4,545.7 in 2016), 10% in constant currencies and 8% organically, compared to 2016 with strength in both Asia and Europe. The comparatively weaker U.S. dollar in 2017 did not significantly impact net sales compared to 2016.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $878.3 or 12.5% of net sales for 2017, compared to $798.2 or 12.7% of net sales for 2016. Administrative expenses increased approximately $28.9 in 2017 primarily related to increases in stock-based compensation expense, employee-related benefits and amortization of acquisition-related identified intangible assets, and represented approximately 4.8% of net sales in 2017 and 4.9% of net sales in 2016. Research and development expenses increased approximately $27.6 in 2017 primarily related to increases in expenses for new product development and represented approximately 2.8% of net sales in 2017 and 2.6% of net sales in 2016. Selling and marketing expenses increased approximately $23.6 in 2017 primarily related to the increase in sales volume and represented approximately 4.9% of net sales in 2017 and 5.1% of net sales in 2016.\nOperating income was $1,427.6 or 20.4% of net sales in 2017, compared to $1,205.2 or 19.2% of net sales in 2016. Operating income for 2017 includes $4.0 of acquisition-related expenses, related to external transaction costs incurred in the second quarter of 2017. Operating income for 2016 includes $36.6 of acquisition-related expenses, which includes external transaction costs, amortization related to the value associated with acquired backlog and post-closing restructuring charges related to the acquisition of FCI Asia Pte. Ltd. ( FCI\u201d), as well as transaction costs associated with other acquisitions. These acquisition-related expenses are separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, as defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section below, were $1,431.6 or 20.4% of net sales in 2017 and $1,241.8 or 19.8% in 2016. The increase in Adjusted Operating Margin for 2017 compared to 2016, was driven primarily by an increase in operating margin for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment in 2017 was $1,475.2 or 22.3% of net sales, compared to $1,280.3 or 21.6% of net sales in 2016. The increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by strong operating leverage on higher sales volumes. In addition, the operating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2017 was $54.2 or 13.4% of net sales, compared to $52.8 or 14.5% of net sales in 2016. The decrease in operating income margin for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by increases in certain commodity costs.\nInterest expense was $92.3 in 2017 compared to $72.6 in 2016. The increase is primarily due to higher average debt levels, which resulted from the Company's dividend and stock buyback programs, as well as higher average interest rates partially driven by the senior note issuances in April 2017.\nProvision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 51.1% in 2017 and 27.0% in 2016. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2017 resulted primarily from the Tax Act Charge of $398.5, partially offset by the excess tax benefits of $66.6 related to stock-based compensation. Excluding the effect of these items, the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section below, was 26.5% for both 2017 and 2016, as reconciled in the table below to the comparable effective tax rate based on GAAP results.

Excluding the effect of the aforementioned (a) Tax Act Charge, (b) excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and (c) the acquisition-related expenses incurred in 2017 and 2016, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Adjusted Diluted EPS, as defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section below within this Item 7, were $986.1 and $3.12, respectively, for

and Capital Resources\nLiquidity and Cash Requirements\nAt December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1,291.7 and $1,753.7, respectively. The majority of the Company's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand as of December 31, 2018 is located outside of the United States. The Company used approximately $400, net of cash acquired, of its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2018 to fund the acquisition of SSI Controls Technologies ( SSI\u201d) in January 2019, as described below. In addition, in January 2019, the Company issued $500.0 principal amount of 4.350% Senior Notes due June 1, 2029, the net proceeds of which were used, along with borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, to repay the Company's $750.0 outstanding principal amount of 2.55% Senior Notes due in January 2019.\nPrior to the Tax Act, the Company asserted its intention to indefinitely reinvest outside of the United States all of its foreign earnings not otherwise distributed currently. For earnings occurring on or after January 1, 2018, the Tax Act's change to a modified territorial tax system in the United States has significantly reduced the U.S. tax expense associated with the remittance of foreign earnings, among other changes. The Tax Act also imposed a one-time transition tax on all of the Company's pre-2018 accumulated unremitted foreign earnings. As a result, on December 31, 2017, the Company\nrecorded a provisional U.S. tax expense for the Transition Tax, which was adjusted in 2018. This Transition Tax on the deemed repatriation of the accumulated unremitted earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, will be paid, net of applicable tax credits and deductions, in annual installments until 2025, as permitted under the Tax Act. In the second quarter of 2018, the Company paid the first annual installment of the Transition Tax of approximately $18.0.\nAs a result of the Tax Act, on December 31, 2017 the Company indicated an intention to repatriate most of its pre-2018 accumulated earnings and recorded the foreign and U.S. state and local tax costs related to the repatriation. The associated tax payments are due as the repatriations are made, and the Company made foreign and U.S. state and local payments of approximately $69.0 on repatriations in 2018. The Company intends to distribute certain 2018 foreign earnings and has accrued foreign and U.S. state and local taxes, if applicable, on those earnings as appropriate and intends to indefinitely reinvest all remaining 2018 foreign earnings. The Company intends to evaluate certain post-2018 earnings for distribution, and accrue for those distributions where appropriate, and to indefinitely reinvest all other foreign earnings.\nThe Company's primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand, the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the Euro Commercial Paper Program, and the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility (each as defined below in this Item 7). The Company believes that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment position on hand, ability to generate future cash flow from operations, availability under its credit facilities, and access to capital markets (including the recent issuance of the 2029 Senior Notes in January 2019, discussed further within this Item 7) provide adequate liquidity to meet its obligations for the next twelve months.\nThe Company's primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchases of its Common Stock, funding of pension obligations, dividends, debt service, payments associated with the Transition Tax (which is payable in annual installments until 2025) and taxes due upon the repatriation of foreign earnings (which will be payable upon the repatriation of such earnings). The Company's debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on the Company's senior notes, revolving credit facility, and commercial paper programs. The Company also may use cash to fund all or part of the cost of acquisitions, as we did with the January 2019 acquisition of SSI. The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2019 will be in a range of 3% to 4% of net sales.\nCash Flow Summary\nThe following table summarizes the Company's cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow:\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,112.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,144.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,077.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(441.8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(380.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,612.7)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,070.1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(140.1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(133.5)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(40.6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n60.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(34.0)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(439.8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n684.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(702.6)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nThe ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of the Company's fundamental financial strengths. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $1,112.7 for 2018 compared to $1,144.2 for 2017. The decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities ( Operating Cash Flow\u201d) for 2018 is primarily related to (i) certain tax payments made, primarily in the first half of 2018, related to the Tax Act Charge of approximately $87.0, including the first annual installment of the Transition Tax of approximately $18.0 in the second quarter of 2018 and payments for foreign and U.S. state and local taxes of approximately $69.0 related to foreign cash repatriated during 2018 and (ii) the Company's voluntary cash contribution of approximately $81.0 in the first quarter of 2018 to fund our U.S. defined benefit pension plans ( U.S. Plans\u201d). Excluding these items, Operating Cash Flow in 2018 increased primarily due to the increase in net income, which was partially offset by the higher usage of cash related to the change in working capital. Operating Cash Flow was $1,144.2 for 2017 compared to $1,077.6 for 2016. The increase in Operating Cash Flow in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in net income (excluding the effects of the non-cash Tax Act Charge of $398.5), which more than offset a higher usage of cash related to the change in working capital.\nIn 2018, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $362.4, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to increases in accounts receivable, inventories and other current assets of $237.9, $173.3 and $47.7, respectively, partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, including income taxes, of $48.8 and $47.7, respectively. In 2017, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $158.1, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, due primarily to increases in accounts receivable, inventories and other current assets of $146.5, $100.4 and $75.9, respectively, partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $140.5 and $24.2, respectively. In 2016, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow decreased $51.2, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, due primarily to increases in accrued income taxes, other accrued liabilities, and accounts payable of $91.7, $61.9, and $47.8, respectively, and a decrease in other current assets of $29.9, partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories of $165.9 and $14.2, respectively.\nThe following describes the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. Accounts receivable increased $193.2 to $1,791.8 primarily due to increased sales volumes in the fourth quarter of 2018 relative to the fourth quarter of 2017, partially offset by the effect of translation from exchange rate changes at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 ( Translation\u201d). Days sales outstanding at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were approximately 73 days. Inventories increased $126.9 to $1,233.8, primarily to support higher sales levels, partially offset by Translation. Inventory days at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were approximately 74 days and 76 days, respectively. Other current assets increased $57.5 to $254.3 primarily due to the increase in other receivables and prepaid expenses as well as the recording of contract assets of $25.4 as a result of the adoption of the revenue recognition standard (Topic 606, as discussed below). Property, plant and equipment, net, increased $59.0 to $875.8, primarily due to capital additions of approximately $340.2, partially offset by depreciation of $247.6, disposals and Translation. Goodwill increased $60.6 to $4,103.2 primarily as a result of goodwill recognized related to three acquisitions in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment that closed in 2018, partially offset by Translation. Intangibles, net and other long-term assets increased $5.8 to $494.3 primarily as a result of the identifiable intangible assets of $8.0 recognized related to 2018 acquisitions and an increase in deferred taxes, partially offset by the amortization of $46.9 on the Company's intangible assets and Translation. Accounts payable increased $14.9 to $890.5, primarily as a result of increased purchasing activity related to higher sales levels, which was partially offset by Translation. Payable days at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were 53 and 60, respectively. Total accrued expenses, including accrued income taxes, increased $93.8 to $796.5, primarily as a result of an increase in certain accrued employee-related compensation and benefit costs, as well as accrued income taxes, net of the tax payments of (i) the first annual installment payment of the Transition Tax and (ii) foreign and U.S. state and local taxes paid related to foreign cash repatriated. Accrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations decreased $81.8 to $190.2, primarily due to the Company's voluntary cash contribution to fund the Company's U.S. Plans. Other long-term liabilities, including deferred tax liabilities, decreased $34.8 to $532.8, primarily as a result of certain long-term tax liabilities becoming current.\nIn 2018, the Company made aggregate cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans (the Plans\u201d, which is comprised of its U.S. Plans together with its foreign plans) of approximately $88.3, of which approximately $81.0 was related to the January 2018 voluntary contribution to fund our U.S. Plans. There is no current requirement for cash contributions to any of the U.S. Plans, and the Company plans to evaluate annually, based on actuarial calculations and the investment performance of the Plans' assets, the timing and amount of cash contributions in the future.\nIn addition to Operating Cash Flow, the Company also considers Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section below, as a key metric in measuring the Company's ability to generate cash. The following table reconciles Free Cash Flow to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. The decrease in Free Cash Flow in 2018 compared to 2017 is primarily related to an increase in capital expenditures to support certain new customer programs, along with a modest decrease in Operating Cash Flow, as described above. The increase in Free Cash Flow in 2017 compared to 2016 is primarily related to an increase in Operating Cash Flow, as described above, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures.\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating Cash Flow (GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,112.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,144.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,077.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCapital expenditures (GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(310.6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(226.6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(190.8)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFree Cash Flow (non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n802.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n917.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n886.8\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with capital expenditures, proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment, sales and maturities (purchases) of short-term investments, net, and acquisitions.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $441.8 in 2018, compared to $380.2 in 2017 and $1,612.7 in 2016. In 2018, net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $305.6 and the use of $158.9 in cash to fund acquisitions, partially offset by sales and maturities of short-term investments, net of $22.7. In 2017, net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by the use of $265.5 in cash to fund acquisitions, along with capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $222.5, partially offset by sales and maturities of short-term investments, net of $107.8. In 2016, net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by the use of $1,305.1 in cash to fund acquisitions, most significantly the acquisition of FCI for $1,178.6, capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $183.7, and purchases of short-term investments, net of $123.9.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with borrowings and repayments of the Company's credit facilities and other long-term debt, repurchases of common stock, proceeds from the exercise of stock options, dividend payments, and purchases of and distributions to shareholders of noncontrolling interests.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1,070.1 in 2018, compared to $140.1 in 2017 and $133.5 in 2016. In 2018, net cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by repurchases of the Company's common stock of $935.2, net repayments of commercial paper and other debt of $559.8, dividend payments of $253.7, purchases of and distributions to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $18.2 and payments of costs related to debt financing associated with the issuances of the Euro senior notes and Euro commercial paper program of $5.6, partially offset by net cash proceeds from the October 2018 issuance of the Euro senior notes of $571.7 and cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $130.7. In 2017, net cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by repurchases of the Company's common stock of $618.0, repayment of the Company's 1.55% Senior Notes due September 2017 of $375.0, dividend payments of $205.0, purchases of and distributions to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $24.4 and payments of costs related to debt financing associated with the issuances of two series of senior notes of $5.2, partially offset by borrowings related to the issuances of two series of senior notes in April 2017 of $749.3, net borrowings under the commercial paper program of $154.1, and cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $184.1. In 2016, net cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by repurchases of the Company's common stock of $325.8, dividend payments of $172.7, distributions to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $6.8 and payments of costs related to the refinancing of our revolving credit facility of $3.0, partially offset by cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options including the related excess tax benefits of $191.6 and increased net borrowings of commercial paper of $183.2.\nThe Company has significant flexibility to meet its financial commitments. The Company uses debt financing to lower the overall cost of capital and increase return on stockholders' equity. The Company's debt financing includes the use of the commercial paper programs, the revolving credit facility and senior notes as part of its overall cash management strategy.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company had a $2,000.0 unsecured credit facility (the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d), which matured in March 2021 and gave the Company the ability to borrow at a spread over LIBOR. At December 31, 2018, there were no borrowings under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility. The 2016 Revolving Credit Facility required payment of certain annual agency and commitment fees and required that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants. At December 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility.\nOn January 15, 2019, the Company amended its 2016 Revolving Credit Facility with a new $2,500.0 unsecured credit facility ( 2019 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). The 2019 Revolving Credit Facility, which matures January 2024, increases the aggregate commitments by $500.0 and, consistent with the previous 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, gives the Company the ability to borrow at a spread over LIBOR. The Company intends to utilize the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes.\nThe Company has a commercial paper program pursuant to which the Company issues short-term unsecured commercial paper notes in one or more private placements in the United States (the U.S. Commercial Paper Program\u201d). The amount of U.S. commercial paper notes outstanding ( USCP Notes\u201d) as of December 31, 2018 was $554.5.\nOn July 10, 2018, the Company and one of its wholly owned European subsidiaries (the Euro Issuer\u201d) entered into a euro-commercial paper program (the Euro Commercial Paper Program\u201d and, together with the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the Commercial Paper Programs\u201d) pursuant to which the Euro Issuer may issue short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (the ECP Notes\u201d and, together with the USCP Notes, the Commercial Paper\u201d), which are guaranteed by the Company and are to be issued outside of the United States. The ECP Notes may be issued in Euros, Sterling, U.S. Dollars or other currencies. The amount of ECP Notes outstanding as of December 31, 2018 was \u20ac60.0 (approximately $68.8).\nAmounts available under the Commercial Paper Programs are borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors' authorization for the ECP Notes limits the maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of USCP Notes, ECP Notes, and any other commercial paper, euro-commercial paper or similar programs at any time to $2,000.0, which was then further increased to $2,500.0 in conjunction with the amended 2019 Revolving Credit Facility. The maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of USCP Notes at any time was also increased to $2,500.0, while the maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of ECP Notes at any time remains at $2,000.0. The Commercial Paper Programs are rated A-2 by Standard & Poor's and P-2 by Moody's and are currently backstopped by the Revolving Credit Facility, as amounts undrawn under the Company's existing Revolving Credit Facility are available to repay the Commercial Paper, if necessary. Net proceeds of the issuances of Commercial Paper are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. The Company reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt regularly and may replace certain amounts of commercial paper, short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt with new issuances of long-term debt in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company has outstanding senior notes (the Senior Notes\u201d) as follows:\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrincipal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nInterest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMaturity\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n750.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.55 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\nJanuary 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n400.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.20 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\nApril 2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n375.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.125 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\nSeptember 2021\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n500.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.00 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\nFebruary 2022\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n350.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.20 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\nApril 2024\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\u20ac\n</td> <td>\n500.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.00 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\nOctober 2028 (Euro Notes)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe U.S. Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company's other unsecured senior indebtedness. Interest on each series of the U.S. Senior Notes is payable semiannually. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of any series of U.S. Senior Notes, subject to certain terms and conditions.\nOn April 5, 2017, the Company issued $400.0 principal amount of unsecured 2.20% Senior Notes due April 1, 2020 (the 2020 Senior Notes\u201d) and $350.0 principal amount of unsecured 3.20% Senior Notes due April 1, 2024 (the 2024 Senior Notes\u201d and, together with the 2020 Senior Notes, the 2020 and 2024 Notes\u201d). In September 2017, the Company used the net proceeds from the 2020 and 2024 Notes to repay all of its outstanding $375.0 principal amount of 1.55% Senior Notes due September 15, 2017, with the remainder of the net proceeds being used for general corporate purposes.\nOn October 8, 2018, the Euro Issuer issued \u20ac500.0 (approximately $574.6) principal amount of unsecured 2.000% Senior Notes due October 8, 2028 at 99.498% of face value (the 2028 Euro Notes\u201d, and collectively with the Senior Notes in the United States, Senior Notes\u201d). The 2028 Euro Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Euro Issuer's other unsecured senior indebtedness, and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company. Interest on the 2028 Euro Notes is payable annually on October 8 of each year, commencing on October 8, 2019. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 2028 Euro Notes at any time by paying 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase, and if redeemed prior to July 8, 2028, a make-whole premium. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the 2028 Euro Notes to repay a portion of the outstanding amounts under its Commercial Paper Programs, with the remainder of the net proceeds being used for general corporate purposes.\nOn January 9, 2019, the Company issued $500.0 principal amount of unsecured 4.350% Senior Notes due June 1, 2029 at 99.904% of face value (the 2029 Senior Notes\u201d). The 2029 Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company's other unsecured senior indebtedness. Interest on the 2029 Senior Notes is payable semiannually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on June 1, 2019. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 2029 Senior Notes at any time by paying 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase, and if redeemed prior to March 1, 2029, a make-whole premium. The Company used the net proceeds from the 2029 Senior Notes, along with proceeds from borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, to repay the outstanding amount of the Company's 2.55% Senior Notes due in January 2019.\nThe Company's Senior Notes contain certain financial and non-financial covenants. At December 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under its Senior Notes. Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Company's debt.\nOn April 24, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase up to $2,000.0 of the Company's Common Stock during the three-year period ending April 24, 2021 in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act (the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program\u201d). During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 6.4 million shares of its Common Stock for $553.2 under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. Approximately 5.7 million shares, or $498.2, have been retired by the Company; the remaining 0.7 million shares, or $55.0, have been retained in Treasury stock. From January 1, 2019 through January 31, 2019, the Company repurchased approximately 0.6 million additional shares of its Common Stock for $50.6, leaving approximately $1,396.2 available to purchase under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. The price and timing of any future purchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, dividends, economic and market conditions and stock price.\nOn January 24, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could purchase up to $1,000.0 of the Company's Common Stock during the two-year period ending January 24, 2019 in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act (the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program\u201d). During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 4.2 million shares of its Common Stock for $382.0, while during the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company repurchased 8.4 million shares of its Common Stock for $618.0. These shares have been retired by the Company. These repurchases of approximately 12.6 million shares for $1,000.0 completed the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program.\nIn January 2015, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could purchase up to 10 million shares of the Company's Common Stock during the two-year period ended January 20, 2017 (the 2015 Stock Repurchase Program\u201d). During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company repurchased 5.5 million shares of its Common Stock for $325.8. These shares have been retired by the Company. At December 31, 2016, the Company had repurchased all of the shares authorized under the 2015 Stock Repurchase Program.\nContingent upon declaration by the Board of Directors, the Company generally pays a quarterly dividend on shares of its Common Stock. On April 24, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors approved an increase to its quarterly dividend rate from $0.19 to $0.23 per share effective with dividends declared in the second quarter of 2018. The following table summarizes the declared quarterly dividends per share for each of the three years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFirst Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.14\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSecond Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.14\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nThird Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.14\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFourth Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.16\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes the dividends declared per share as well as the dividends declared and paid for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDividends declared\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n264.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n213.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n178.8\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDividends paid (including those declared in the prior year)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n253.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n205.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n172.7\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPensions\nThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries in the United States have defined benefit pension plans ( U.S. Plans\u201d), which cover certain U.S. employees and which represent the majority of the plan assets and benefit obligations of the aggregate defined benefit plans of the Company. The U.S. Plans' benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain U.S. employees not covered by the U.S. Plans are covered by defined contribution plans. Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees (the Foreign Plans\u201d and, together with the U.S. Plans, the Plans\u201d). The total liability for accrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations under the Company's pension and postretirement benefit plans decreased in 2018 to $178.5 ($4.8 of which represents the expected benefit payments to be made during 2019 primarily for unfunded foreign plans, as included in other accrued expenses) from $256.9 in 2017 primarily due to the voluntary contribution of $81.0 made in January 2018 to fund the U.S. Plans as well as the impact of higher discount rates on our projected benefit obligation. There is no current requirement for cash contributions to any of the U.S. Plans, and the Company plans to evaluate annually, based on actuarial calculations and the investment performance of the Plans' assets, the timing and amount of cash contributions in the future.\nRefer to Note 7 of the Notes to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company's benefit plans and other postretirement benefit plans.\nAcquisitions\nIn January 2019, pursuant to a definitive agreement entered into on November 27, 2018, the Company acquired SSI Controls Technologies ( SSI\u201d), the sensor manufacturing division of SSI Technologies, Inc., for approximately $400, net of cash acquired (subject to customary post-closing adjustments), plus a performance-related contingent payment. The acquisition of SSI was funded by cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand. SSI, which is headquartered in the state of Wisconsin in the United States, is a leading designer and manufacturer of sensors and sensing solutions for the global automotive and industrial markets.\nEnvironmental Matters\nCertain operations of the Company are subject to environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nInflation and Costs\nThe cost of the Company's products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials. The Company strives to offset the impact of increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services through price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs. However, in certain markets, particularly in communications related markets, implementing price increases can be difficult and there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful. For a discussion of certain risks attendant to inflation and costs, refer to the risk factor titled The Company may experience difficulties in obtaining a consistent supply of materials at stable pricing levels\u201d in Part I, Item 1A herein.\nForeign Exchange\nThe Company conducts business in many foreign currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies including possible currency devaluations. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company's sales, operating margins and equity. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold, thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency, cost reduction and pricing actions, and working capital management. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk, including in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies of the Company's worldwide operations. For further discussion of foreign exchange exposures, risks and uncertainties, refer to the risk factor titled The Company's results may be negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates\u201d in Part I, Item 1A herein.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to assessing the Company's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management utilizes certain non-GAAP financial measures defined below as part of its internal reviews for purposes of monitoring, evaluating and forecasting the Company's financial performance, communicating operating results to the Company's Board of Directors and assessing related employee compensation measures. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures may be helpful to investors in assessing the Company's overall financial performance, trends and year-over-year comparative results, in addition to the reasons noted below. Non-GAAP financial measures related to operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, effective tax rate and diluted EPS exclude income and expenses that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the years presented. Items excluded in such non-GAAP financial measures in any period may consist of, without limitation, acquisition-related expenses, refinancing-related costs, and certain discrete tax items including but not limited to (i) the excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and (ii) the Tax Act Charge recorded in 2017 and the subsequent adjustment recorded in 2018 related to this charge. Non-GAAP financial measures related to net sales exclude the impact related to foreign currency exchange and acquisitions. The non-GAAP financial information contained herein is included for supplemental purposes only and should not be considered in isolation, as a substitute for or superior to the related U.S. GAAP financial measures. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not necessarily the same or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies, as such measures may be calculated differently or may exclude different items.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures defined below should be read in conjunction with the Company's financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are included in Results of Operations\u201d and Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d within this Item 7:\nTable 135: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAdjusted Diluted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share (as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP), excluding income and expenses and their specific tax effects, that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the years presented.

Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available. The Company's critical accounting policies and estimates are set forth below. The significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nAdoption of Topic 606\nThe Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (collectively with its related subsequent amendments, Topic 606\u201d) as of January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Under this transition method, the Company's results in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while the comparative results for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were not retrospectively adjusted. Results for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were recognized in accordance with the Company's revenue recognition policy then in effect under ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition ( Topic 605\u201d) discussed below. The adoption of Topic 606 resulted in accounting policy changes surrounding revenue recognition which replaced previous revenue guidance under Topic 605.\nThe Company's primary source of revenues consist of product sales to either end customers and their appointed contract manufacturers (including original equipment manufacturers or OEM) or to distributors. Our revenues are derived from contracts with customers, which in most cases are customer purchase orders that may be governed by master sales agreements. For each contract, the promise to transfer the control of the products, each of which is individually distinct, is considered to be the identified performance obligation. As part of the consideration promised in each contract, the Company evaluates the customer's credit risk. Our contracts do not have any significant financing components, as payment terms are generally due net 30 to 120 days after delivery. Although products are almost always sold at fixed prices, in determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund (due to returns) or adjustment (due to volume discounts, rebates, or price concessions) to determine the net consideration we expect to be entitled to. We allocate the transaction price to each distinct product based on its relative standalone selling price. Taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from the customer, including but not limited to sales and use taxes and value-added taxes, are not included in the transaction price.\nThe vast majority of our sales are recognized at a point-in-time under the core principle of recognizing revenue when control transfers to the customer, which generally occurs when we ship or deliver the product from our\nmanufacturing facility to our customers, when our customer accepts and has legal title of the goods, and the Company has a present right to payment for such goods. Based on the respective contract terms, most of our contracts' revenues are recognized either (i) upon shipment based on free on board ( FOB\u201d) shipping point, (ii) when the product arrives at its destination or (iii) when the products are pulled from consignment inventory. For the year ended December 31, 2018, less than 5% of our net sales are recognized over time, as the associated contracts relate to the sale of goods with no alternative use as they are only sold to a single customer and whose underlying contract terms provide the Company with an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin, for performance completed to date, in the event of customer termination. For the contracts recognized over time, we typically record revenue using the input method, based on the materials and labor costs incurred to date relative to the contract's total estimated costs. This method reasonably depicts when and as control of the goods transfers to the customer, since it measures our progress in producing the goods which is generally commensurate with this transfer of control. Since we typically invoice our customers at the same time that we satisfy our performance obligations, we do not have significant contract assets or contract liabilities related to our contracts with customers recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nPre-adoption of Topic 606\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, revenue from sales of the Company's products was recognized at the time the goods were delivered, title passed and the risks and rewards of ownership passed to the customer, provided the earnings process was complete and revenue was measurable. Such recognition generally occurred when the products reached the shipping point, the sales price was fixed and determinable, and collection was reasonably assured. Delivery was determined by the Company's shipping terms, which was primarily freight on board shipping point. Revenue was recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts, allowances and returns. These estimates and reserves were determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience, contract terms and other related factors.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income taxes are provided for revenue and expenses which are recognized in different periods for income tax and financial statement reporting purposes. The Company recognizes the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on deferred income taxes in the period in which legislation is enacted. Deferred income taxes are provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the period in which the Company determines it no longer intends to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the United States. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has not provided for deferred income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings related to certain geographies of approximately $800, as it is the Company's intention to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the United States. The amount of taxes that would be payable if these undistributed foreign earnings were to be repatriated would not be material. In addition, the Company remains indefinitely reinvested with respect to its financial statement basis in excess of tax basis of its investments in foreign subsidiaries. It is not practicable to determine the deferred tax liability with respect to such basis differences. Deferred tax assets are regularly assessed for recoverability based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels and a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that these amounts will not be recovered. The tax effects of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if it is more likely than not\u201d to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on its technical merits as of the reporting date. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company includes estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.\nAs a result of the Tax Act, in 2017, the Company recorded (i) a provisional income tax charge related to the deemed repatriation of the accumulated unremitted earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, (ii) a provisional income tax charge related to changes in the Company's permanent reinvestment assertion with regards to prior accumulated unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by (iii) a provisional income tax benefit associated with the remeasurement of its net deferred tax liabilities due to the U.S. federal corporate tax rate reduction, and included these amounts in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. Beginning in 2018, the Tax Act also included a global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\") provision, which imposes a tax on foreign earnings in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign subsidiaries. The Company elected an accounting policy to account for GILTI as a period cost if incurred, rather than recognizing deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI. The U.S. Treasury Department has not yet released final interpretive guidance relating to certain provisions of the Tax Act. The Company will account for the impact of additional guidance in the period in which any new guidance is released, if appropriate.\nIn December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d) to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations where a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. In 2017, the Company recorded provisional income tax charges as a result of the Tax Act. Due to the timing of the Tax Act's enactment and the complexity of its provisions, the Company had not completed its accounting for the impact of the Tax Act in 2017. As discussed in Note 1 of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, SAB 118 was subsequently codified under ASU 2018-05 in March 2018.\nThe Company analyzed guidance and technical interpretations issued in 2018 related to the provisions of the Tax Act, and refined, analyzed and updated the underlying data, computations and assumptions used to prepare these provisional amounts. The Company completed its accounting of the Tax Act Charge and recorded an income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nDisclosures about contractual obligations and commitments\nThe following table summarizes the Company's known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2018, as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied.\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayment Due By Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1-3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3-5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMore than\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDebt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,584.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n764.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,399.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n500.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n920.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest related to senior notes (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n303.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n72.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n113.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n55.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n62.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n197.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n70.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n64.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n28.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n33.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPurchase obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n414.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n384.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n23.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAccrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n58.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n27.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTransition tax (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n151.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n27.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n39.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n71.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,709.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,313.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,639.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n638.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,118.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThe Company has excluded expected interest payments on the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility, U.S. Commercial Paper Program and Euro Commercial Paper Program from the above table, as this calculation is largely dependent on average debt levels the Company expects to have during each of the years presented.

Over the past several years, there has been no minimum requirement for Company contributions to the U.S. Plans due to prior contributions made in excess of minimum requirements and as a result, there was no anticipated minimum required contribution included in the table above related to the U.S. Plans for 2019. However, the Company did make a voluntary contribution of approximately $81.0 in 2018 to fund the U.S. Plans. It is not possible to reasonably estimate expected required contributions in the above table after 2019 since several assumptions are required to calculate minimum required contributions, such as the discount rate and expected returns on pension assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAs a result of the enactment of the Tax Act in December 2017, the Company recorded a provisional tax charge on the deemed repatriation of the accumulated unremitted earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries ( Transition Tax\u201d) for the year ended December 31, 2017, based on certain assumptions made upon the Company's then current interpretation of the Tax Act. The Company analyzed guidance and technical interpretations issued in 2018 related to the provisions of the Tax Act, and refined, analyzed and updated the underlying data, computations and assumptions used to prepare the provisional amount, and consequently completed its accounting and recorded an adjustment related to the Transition Tax.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(amounts in millions, except share and per share data, unless otherwise noted)\nThe following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, herein. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in U.S. dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). The following discussion and analysis also includes references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section below, including Constant Currency Net Sales Growth\u201d and Organic Net Sales Growth\u201d. For purposes of the following discussion, the terms constant currencies\u201d and organically\u201d have the same meanings as these aforementioned non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d within this Item 7 for more information, including our reasons for including non-GAAP financial measures and material limitations with respect to the usefulness of the measures.\nIn addition to historical information, the following discussion and analysis also contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the risk factors described in Item 1A herein, as well as the risks and uncertainties that exist with the use of forward-looking statements as described in the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d section included herein at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nGeneral\nThe Company is one of the world's largest designers, manufacturers and marketers of electrical, electronic and fiber optic connectors, interconnect systems, antennas, sensors and sensor-based products and coaxial and high-speed specialty cable. The Company operates through two reporting segments: (i) Interconnect Products and Assemblies and (ii) Cable Products and Solutions. In 2018, approximately 73% of the Company's sales were outside the United States. The primary end markets for our products are:\n \u00b7 information technology and communication devices and systems for the converging technologies of voice, video and data communications; \n \u00b7 a broad range of industrial applications and traditional and hybrid-electric automotive applications; and \n \u00b7 commercial aerospace and military applications. \nThe Company's products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers. The Company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time. There has been a trend on the part of customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have the ability to meet certain technical, quality, delivery and other standards while maintaining competitive prices. The Company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment. The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers.\nStrategy\nThe Company's strategy is to provide its customers with comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service on a worldwide basis while maintaining continuing programs of productivity improvement and cost control. The Company focuses its research and development efforts through close collaboration with its customers to develop highly-engineered products that meet customer needs and have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one- to three-year period. The Company is also focused on controlling costs. The Company does this by investing in modern manufacturing technologies, controlling purchasing processes and expanding into lower cost areas.\nThe Company's strategic objective is to further enhance its position in its served markets by pursuing the following success factors:\n \u00b7 Pursue broad diversification; \n \u00b7 Develop performance-enhancing interconnect solutions; \n \u00b7 Expand global presence; \n \u00b7 Control costs; \n \u00b7 Pursue strategic acquisitions and investments; and \n \u00b7 Foster collaborative, entrepreneurial management. \nIn 2018, the Company reported net sales, operating income and net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation of $8,202.0, $1,686.9 and $1,205.0, respectively, up 17%, 18% and 85%, respectively, from 2017. In 2018, the Company's net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation was impacted by the recognition of an income tax benefit of $14.5 related to the completion of the accounting for the Tax Act Charge (defined below) in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the recognition of excess tax benefits of $19.8 from stock option exercises, partially offset by acquisition-related expenses incurred during the year. In 2017, the Company's net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation was impacted by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017 which resulted in a provisional income tax charge of $398.5 as discussed in more detail below and in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements within this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in addition to the impact of the acquisition-related expenses incurred during the year, partially offset by the excess tax benefits of $66.6 recognized from stock option exercises. Excluding the effects of these items, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, as defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section below and as reconciled in Part II, Item 6 and Item 7 herein, increased by 18% and 19%, respectively, in 2018. Sales and profitability trends are discussed in detail in Results of Operations\u201d below. In addition, a strength of the Company has been its ability to consistently generate cash from operations. The Company uses cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, repurchase shares of its common stock, pay dividends and reduce indebtedness. In 2018, the Company generated operating cash flow of $1,112.7.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\nOn December 22, 2017, the United States federal government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Tax Act\u201d), marking a change from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax system in the United States. As part of this change, the Tax Act, among other changes, provides for a transition tax on the accumulated unremitted foreign earnings and profits of the Company's foreign subsidiaries ( Transition Tax\u201d) and a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded an income tax charge of $398.5 ( Tax Act Charge\u201d) that was comprised of (i) the Transition Tax of $259.4, (ii) a charge of $176.6 related to changes in the Company's permanent reinvestment assertion with regards to prior accumulated unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by (iii) a tax benefit of $37.5 associated with the remeasurement of the Company's U.S. net deferred tax liabilities due to the U.S. federal corporate tax rate reduction. As discussed under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates within this Item 7, the three components of the Tax Act Charge were provisional amounts recorded in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d). SAB 118, which is now codified under ASU 2018-05, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, addresses the application of U.S. GAAP in situations where a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. Due to the timing of the Tax Act's enactment and the complexity of its provisions, the Company had not completed its accounting for the impact of the Tax Act as of December 31, 2017. The Company analyzed guidance and technical interpretations issued in 2018 related to the provisions of the Tax Act, and refined, analyzed and updated the underlying data, computations and assumptions used to prepare the Tax Act Charge. As a result, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $14.5 in 2018 related to the completion of the accounting for the Tax Act Charge.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth the components of net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation as a percentage of net sales for the years indicated.\n\n2018 Compared to 2017\nNet sales were $8,202.0 for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $7,011.3 for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 17% in both U.S. dollars and constant currencies and 14% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts) over the prior year. Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 95% of net sales) increased 18% in U.S. dollars, 17% in constant currencies and 14% organically in 2018, compared to 2017. The sales growth was driven by growth in the mobile devices, industrial, automotive, information technology and data communications, military, mobile networks and commercial aerospace markets, partially offset by a slight decline in sales into the broadband communications market, with growth resulting primarily from organic strength, in addition to contributions from the Company's acquisitions. Net sales to the mobile devices market increased (approximately $403.6) primarily due to growth in sales of products incorporated into smartphones and related accessories, partially offset by declining sales of products incorporated into tablets. Net sales to the industrial market increased (approximately $214.9), reflecting sales strength in medical, heavy equipment, electric vehicle, railway and mass transit, and oil and gas, as well as contributions from acquisitions. Net sales to the automotive market increased (approximately $184.9), driven by growth and expansion in most regions of the global automotive market, as well as contributions from acquisitions. Net sales to the information technology and data communications market increased (approximately $166.1), reflecting organic growth in products for data centers, including server and networking-related applications, storage, and consumer electronics. Net sales to the military market increased (approximately $133.2), driven by broad strength across the market including increased sales into avionics, military communications and military airframe applications, as well as missile applications. Net sales to the mobile networks market increased (approximately $56.3), due to increased sales to both mobile networks equipment manufacturers and mobile operators. Net sales to the commercial aerospace market increased (approximately $39.6) primarily due to strength in large passenger planes. Net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 5% of net sales), which primarily serves the broadband communications market, increased 4% in U.S. dollars, 6% in constant currencies and 6% organically in 2018, compared to 2017. The increase in the Cable Products and Solutions segment was primarily due to an increase in cable products sold into the mobile networks market, which was partially offset by the slight decrease in sales into the broadband communications market.\nThe table below reconciles Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, by segment and consolidated, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017:\n\n (1) Net sales growth in U.S. dollars is calculated based on Net sales as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Note 11 of the accompanying financial statements. \n (2) Foreign currency translation impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from foreign currency exchange rate changes in the current year compared to the prior year. Such amount is calculated by subtracting current year net sales translated at average foreign currency exchange rates for the respective prior year from current year reported net sales, taken as a percentage of the respective prior year's net sales. \n (3) Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section. \n (4) Acquisition impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from acquisitions closed since the beginning of the prior calendar year, which were not included in the Company's results as of the comparable prior year and which do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis. \nGeographically, net sales in the United States in 2018 increased approximately 13% in U.S. dollars ($2,241.4 in 2018 versus $1,978.4 in 2017) and 9% organically, compared to 2017. Foreign sales in 2018 increased approximately 18% in U.S. dollars ($5,960.6 in 2018 versus $5,032.9 in 2017), 17% in constant currencies and 15% organically, compared to 2017 with strength in both Asia and Europe. The comparatively slightly weaker U.S. dollar in 2018 had an insignificant effect on net sales compared to 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $959.5 or 11.7% of net sales for 2018, compared to $878.3 or 12.5% of net sales for 2017. Administrative expenses increased approximately $46.4 in 2018 primarily related to increases in employee-related benefits and stock-based compensation expense, and represented approximately 4.7% of net sales in 2018 and 4.8% of net sales in 2017. Research and development expenses increased approximately $27.2 in 2018 primarily related to increases in expenses for new product development and represented approximately 2.7% of net sales in 2018 and 2.8% of net sales in 2017. Selling and marketing expenses increased approximately $7.6 in 2018 primarily related to the increase in sales volume and represented approximately 4.3% of net sales in 2018 and 4.9% of net sales in 2017.\nOperating income was $1,686.9 or 20.6% of net sales in 2018, compared to $1,427.6 or 20.4% of net sales in 2017. Operating income for 2018 and 2017 includes acquisition-related expenses of $8.5 and $4.0, respectively, related to external transaction costs. These acquisition-related expenses are separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, as defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section below, were $1,695.4 or 20.7% of net sales in 2018 and $1,431.6 or 20.4% in 2017. The increase in Adjusted Operating Margin for 2018 compared to 2017 was driven primarily by an increase in operating margin for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment in 2018 was $1,752.5 or 22.5% of net sales, compared to $1,475.2 or 22.3% of net sales in 2017. The increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by strong operating leverage on higher sales volumes. In addition, the operating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2018 was $52.6 or 12.5% of net sales, compared to $54.2 or 13.4% of net sales in 2017. The decrease in operating income margin for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by increases in certain commodity costs.\nInterest expense was $101.7 in 2018 compared to $92.3 in 2017. The increase is primarily due to higher average interest rates on the Company's U.S. Commercial Paper Program (as defined below in this Item 7) and the senior note issuances in April 2017.\nProvision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 23.4% in 2018 and 51.1% in 2017. The lower effective tax rate in 2018 compared to 2017 resulted primarily from the Tax Act Charge of $398.5 recorded in 2017, which was partially offset by the excess tax benefits of $66.6 from stock option exercises. The effects of these items were significantly lower in 2018, as the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $14.5 in 2018 related to the completion\nof the accounting for the Tax Act Charge, along with the excess tax benefits of $19.8 from stock option exercises. Excluding the effect of these items along with the effect of acquisition-related expenses in each respective year, the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section below, was 25.5% and 26.5% for 2018 and 2017, respectively, as reconciled in the table below to the comparable effective tax rate based on GAAP results. For additional details related to the reconciliation between the U.S. statutory federal tax rate and the Company's effective tax rate for these years, refer to Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNet income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Net income per common share-Diluted ( Diluted EPS\u201d) was $1,205.0 and $3.85, respectively, for 2018, compared to $650.5 and $2.06, respectively, for 2017. Excluding the effect of the aforementioned (a) Tax Act Charge in 2017 and the subsequent adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018, (b) excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in 2018 and 2017 and (c) the acquisition-related expenses incurred in both years, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Adjusted Diluted EPS, as defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section below within this Item 7, were $1,177.9 and $3.77, respectively, for 2018, compared to $986.1 and $3.12, respectively, for 2017.\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, Adjusted Effective Tax Rate and Adjusted Diluted EPS (all defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section below) to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\n\n (1) While the terms operating margin\u201d and effective tax rate\u201d are not considered U.S. GAAP financial measures, for purposes of this table, we derive the reported (GAAP) measures based on GAAP results, which serve as the basis for the reconciliation to their comparable non-GAAP financial measure. \n2017 Compared to 2016\nNet sales were $7,011.3 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $6,286.4 for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 12% in both U.S. dollars and constant currencies and 8% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts) over the prior year. Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 94% of net sales) increased 12% in both U.S. dollars and constant currencies and 9% organically in 2017, compared to 2016. The sales growth was driven primarily by growth in the industrial, automotive, information technology and data communications, mobile devices, military and commercial aerospace markets, with contributions from both organic strength as well as from the Company's acquisitions, partially offset by a slight decline in sales in the mobile networks market. Net sales to the industrial market increased (approximately $244.4), reflecting sales strength in heavy equipment, industrial instrumentation, oil and gas, and factory automation as well as contributions from acquisitions. Net sales to the automotive market increased (approximately $177.0), driven by growth and expansion in all regions of the global automotive market, as well as contributions from acquisitions. Net sales to the information technology and data communications market increased (approximately $115.0), reflecting organic growth in products for data centers, including server and networking-related applications. Net sales to the mobile devices market increased (approximately $101.1) primarily due to growth in sales of products incorporated into smartphones and related accessories, partially offset by declining sales of products incorporated into tablets. Net sales to the military market increased (approximately $77.8), driven by broad strength across substantially all segments of the market including increased sales into military communications and military airframe applications, as well as missile applications. Net sales to the commercial aerospace market slightly increased (approximately $9.9) primarily due to the contributions from acquisitions as well as strength in large passenger planes, partially offset by continued weakness in demand for business\njets and helicopters. Net sales to the mobile networks market decreased (approximately $20.3), primarily due to reduced overall capital spending by mobile operators. Net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 6% of net sales), which is primarily in the broadband communications market, increased 11% in U.S. dollars and 10% in constant currencies in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to contributions from an acquisition made during the second half of 2016.\nThe table below reconciles Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, by segment and consolidated, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016:\n\n (1) Net sales growth in U.S. dollars is calculated based on Net sales as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Note 11 of the accompanying financial statements. \n (2) Foreign currency translation impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from foreign currency exchange rate changes in the current year compared to the prior year. Such amount is calculated by subtracting current year net sales translated at average foreign currency exchange rates for the respective prior year from current year reported net sales, taken as a percentage of the respective prior year's net sales. \n (3) Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section. \n (4) Acquisition impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from acquisitions closed since the beginning of the prior calendar year, which were not included in the Company's results as of the comparable prior year and which do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis. \nGeographically, net sales in the United States in 2017 increased approximately 14% in U.S. dollars ($1,978.4 in 2017 versus $1,740.7 in 2016) and 8% organically, compared to 2016. Foreign sales in 2017 increased approximately 11% in U.S. dollars ($5,032.9 in 2017 versus $4,545.7 in 2016), 10% in constant currencies and 8% organically, compared to 2016 with strength in both Asia and Europe. The comparatively weaker U.S. dollar in 2017 did not significantly impact net sales compared to 2016.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $878.3 or 12.5% of net sales for 2017, compared to $798.2 or 12.7% of net sales for 2016. Administrative expenses increased approximately $28.9 in 2017 primarily related to increases in stock-based compensation expense, employee-related benefits and amortization of acquisition-related identified intangible assets, and represented approximately 4.8% of net sales in 2017 and 4.9% of net sales in 2016. Research and development expenses increased approximately $27.6 in 2017 primarily related to increases in expenses for new product development and represented approximately 2.8% of net sales in 2017 and 2.6% of net sales in 2016. Selling and marketing expenses increased approximately $23.6 in 2017 primarily related to the increase in sales volume and represented approximately 4.9% of net sales in 2017 and 5.1% of net sales in 2016.\nOperating income was $1,427.6 or 20.4% of net sales in 2017, compared to $1,205.2 or 19.2% of net sales in 2016. Operating income for 2017 includes $4.0 of acquisition-related expenses, related to external transaction costs incurred in the second quarter of 2017. Operating income for 2016 includes $36.6 of acquisition-related expenses, which includes external transaction costs, amortization related to the value associated with acquired backlog and post-closing restructuring charges related to the acquisition of FCI Asia Pte. Ltd. ( FCI\u201d), as well as transaction costs associated with other acquisitions. These acquisition-related expenses are separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, as defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section below, were $1,431.6 or 20.4% of net sales in 2017 and $1,241.8 or 19.8% in 2016. The increase in Adjusted Operating Margin for 2017 compared to 2016, was driven primarily by an increase in operating margin for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment in 2017 was $1,475.2 or 22.3% of net sales, compared to $1,280.3 or 21.6% of net sales in 2016. The increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by strong operating leverage on higher sales volumes. In addition, the operating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2017 was $54.2 or 13.4% of net sales, compared to $52.8 or 14.5% of net sales in 2016. The decrease in operating income margin for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by increases in certain commodity costs.\nInterest expense was $92.3 in 2017 compared to $72.6 in 2016. The increase is primarily due to higher average debt levels, which resulted from the Company's dividend and stock buyback programs, as well as higher average interest rates partially driven by the senior note issuances in April 2017.\nProvision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 51.1% in 2017 and 27.0% in 2016. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2017 resulted primarily from the Tax Act Charge of $398.5, partially offset by the excess tax benefits of $66.6 related to stock-based compensation. Excluding the effect of these items, the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section below, was 26.5% for both 2017 and 2016, as reconciled in the table below to the comparable effective tax rate based on GAAP results. For additional details related to the reconciliation between the U.S. statutory federal tax rate and the Company's effective tax rate for these years, refer to Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNet income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Net income per common share-Diluted ( Diluted EPS\u201d) was $650.5 and $2.06, respectively, for 2017, compared to $822.9 and $2.61, respectively, for 2016. Excluding the effect of the aforementioned (a) Tax Act Charge, (b) excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and (c) the acquisition-related expenses incurred in 2017 and 2016, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Adjusted Diluted EPS, as defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section below within this Item 7, were $986.1 and $3.12, respectively, for 2017, compared to $856.0 and $2.72, respectively, for 2016.\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, Adjusted Effective Tax Rate and Adjusted Diluted EPS (all defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section below) to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n\n (1) While the terms operating margin\u201d and effective tax rate\u201d are not considered U.S. GAAP financial measures, for purposes of this table, we derive the reported (GAAP) measures based on GAAP results, which serve as the basis for the reconciliation to their comparable non-GAAP financial measure. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity and Cash Requirements\nAt December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1,291.7 and $1,753.7, respectively. The majority of the Company's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand as of December 31, 2018 is located outside of the United States. The Company used approximately $400, net of cash acquired, of its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2018 to fund the acquisition of SSI Controls Technologies ( SSI\u201d) in January 2019, as described below. In addition, in January 2019, the Company issued $500.0 principal amount of 4.350% Senior Notes due June 1, 2029, the net proceeds of which were used, along with borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, to repay the Company's $750.0 outstanding principal amount of 2.55% Senior Notes due in January 2019.\nPrior to the Tax Act, the Company asserted its intention to indefinitely reinvest outside of the United States all of its foreign earnings not otherwise distributed currently. For earnings occurring on or after January 1, 2018, the Tax Act's change to a modified territorial tax system in the United States has significantly reduced the U.S. tax expense associated with the remittance of foreign earnings, among other changes. The Tax Act also imposed a one-time transition tax on all of the Company's pre-2018 accumulated unremitted foreign earnings. As a result, on December 31, 2017, the Company\nrecorded a provisional U.S. tax expense for the Transition Tax, which was adjusted in 2018. This Transition Tax on the deemed repatriation of the accumulated unremitted earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, will be paid, net of applicable tax credits and deductions, in annual installments until 2025, as permitted under the Tax Act. In the second quarter of 2018, the Company paid the first annual installment of the Transition Tax of approximately $18.0.\nAs a result of the Tax Act, on December 31, 2017 the Company indicated an intention to repatriate most of its pre-2018 accumulated earnings and recorded the foreign and U.S. state and local tax costs related to the repatriation. The associated tax payments are due as the repatriations are made, and the Company made foreign and U.S. state and local payments of approximately $69.0 on repatriations in 2018. The Company intends to distribute certain 2018 foreign earnings and has accrued foreign and U.S. state and local taxes, if applicable, on those earnings as appropriate and intends to indefinitely reinvest all remaining 2018 foreign earnings. The Company intends to evaluate certain post-2018 earnings for distribution, and accrue for those distributions where appropriate, and to indefinitely reinvest all other foreign earnings.\nThe Company's primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand, the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the Euro Commercial Paper Program, and the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility (each as defined below in this Item 7). The Company believes that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment position on hand, ability to generate future cash flow from operations, availability under its credit facilities, and access to capital markets (including the recent issuance of the 2029 Senior Notes in January 2019, discussed further within this Item 7) provide adequate liquidity to meet its obligations for the next twelve months.\nThe Company's primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchases of its Common Stock, funding of pension obligations, dividends, debt service, payments associated with the Transition Tax (which is payable in annual installments until 2025) and taxes due upon the repatriation of foreign earnings (which will be payable upon the repatriation of such earnings). The Company's debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on the Company's senior notes, revolving credit facility, and commercial paper programs. The Company also may use cash to fund all or part of the cost of acquisitions, as we did with the January 2019 acquisition of SSI. The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2019 will be in a range of 3% to 4% of net sales.\nCash Flow Summary\nThe following table summarizes the Company's cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow:\n\nOperating Activities\nThe ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of the Company's fundamental financial strengths. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $1,112.7 for 2018 compared to $1,144.2 for 2017. The decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities ( Operating Cash Flow\u201d) for 2018 is primarily related to (i) certain tax payments made, primarily in the first half of 2018, related to the Tax Act Charge of approximately $87.0, including the first annual installment of the Transition Tax of approximately $18.0 in the second quarter of 2018 and payments for foreign and U.S. state and local taxes of approximately $69.0 related to foreign cash repatriated during 2018 and (ii) the Company's voluntary cash contribution of approximately $81.0 in the first quarter of 2018 to fund our U.S. defined benefit pension plans ( U.S. Plans\u201d). Excluding these items, Operating Cash Flow in 2018 increased primarily due to the increase in net income, which was partially offset by the higher usage of cash related to the change in working capital. Operating Cash Flow was $1,144.2 for 2017 compared to $1,077.6 for 2016. The increase in Operating Cash Flow in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in net income (excluding the effects of the non-cash Tax Act Charge of $398.5), which more than offset a higher usage of cash related to the change in working capital.\nIn 2018, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $362.4, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to increases in accounts receivable, inventories and other current assets of $237.9, $173.3 and $47.7, respectively, partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, including income taxes, of $48.8 and $47.7, respectively. In 2017, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $158.1, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, due primarily to increases in accounts receivable, inventories and other current assets of $146.5, $100.4 and $75.9, respectively, partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $140.5 and $24.2, respectively. In 2016, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow decreased $51.2, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, due primarily to increases in accrued income taxes, other accrued liabilities, and accounts payable of $91.7, $61.9, and $47.8, respectively, and a decrease in other current assets of $29.9, partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories of $165.9 and $14.2, respectively.\nThe following describes the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. Accounts receivable increased $193.2 to $1,791.8 primarily due to increased sales volumes in the fourth quarter of 2018 relative to the fourth quarter of 2017, partially offset by the effect of translation from exchange rate changes at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 ( Translation\u201d). Days sales outstanding at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were approximately 73 days. Inventories increased $126.9 to $1,233.8, primarily to support higher sales levels, partially offset by Translation. Inventory days at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were approximately 74 days and 76 days, respectively. Other current assets increased $57.5 to $254.3 primarily due to the increase in other receivables and prepaid expenses as well as the recording of contract assets of $25.4 as a result of the adoption of the revenue recognition standard (Topic 606, as discussed below). Property, plant and equipment, net, increased $59.0 to $875.8, primarily due to capital additions of approximately $340.2, partially offset by depreciation of $247.6, disposals and Translation. Goodwill increased $60.6 to $4,103.2 primarily as a result of goodwill recognized related to three acquisitions in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment that closed in 2018, partially offset by Translation. Intangibles, net and other long-term assets increased $5.8 to $494.3 primarily as a result of the identifiable intangible assets of $8.0 recognized related to 2018 acquisitions and an increase in deferred taxes, partially offset by the amortization of $46.9 on the Company's intangible assets and Translation. Accounts payable increased $14.9 to $890.5, primarily as a result of increased purchasing activity related to higher sales levels, which was partially offset by Translation. Payable days at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were 53 and 60, respectively. Total accrued expenses, including accrued income taxes, increased $93.8 to $796.5, primarily as a result of an increase in certain accrued employee-related compensation and benefit costs, as well as accrued income taxes, net of the tax payments of (i) the first annual installment payment of the Transition Tax and (ii) foreign and U.S. state and local taxes paid related to foreign cash repatriated. Accrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations decreased $81.8 to $190.2, primarily due to the Company's voluntary cash contribution to fund the Company's U.S. Plans. Other long-term liabilities, including deferred tax liabilities, decreased $34.8 to $532.8, primarily as a result of certain long-term tax liabilities becoming current.\nIn 2018, the Company made aggregate cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans (the Plans\u201d, which is comprised of its U.S. Plans together with its foreign plans) of approximately $88.3, of which approximately $81.0 was related to the January 2018 voluntary contribution to fund our U.S. Plans. There is no current requirement for cash contributions to any of the U.S. Plans, and the Company plans to evaluate annually, based on actuarial calculations and the investment performance of the Plans' assets, the timing and amount of cash contributions in the future.\nIn addition to Operating Cash Flow, the Company also considers Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section below, as a key metric in measuring the Company's ability to generate cash. The following table reconciles Free Cash Flow to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. The decrease in Free Cash Flow in 2018 compared to 2017 is primarily related to an increase in capital expenditures to support certain new customer programs, along with a modest decrease in Operating Cash Flow, as described above. The increase in Free Cash Flow in 2017 compared to 2016 is primarily related to an increase in Operating Cash Flow, as described above, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures.\n\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with capital expenditures, proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment, sales and maturities (purchases) of short-term investments, net, and acquisitions.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $441.8 in 2018, compared to $380.2 in 2017 and $1,612.7 in 2016. In 2018, net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $305.6 and the use of $158.9 in cash to fund acquisitions, partially offset by sales and maturities of short-term investments, net of $22.7. In 2017, net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by the use of $265.5 in cash to fund acquisitions, along with capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $222.5, partially offset by sales and maturities of short-term investments, net of $107.8. In 2016, net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by the use of $1,305.1 in cash to fund acquisitions, most significantly the acquisition of FCI for $1,178.6, capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $183.7, and purchases of short-term investments, net of $123.9.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with borrowings and repayments of the Company's credit facilities and other long-term debt, repurchases of common stock, proceeds from the exercise of stock options, dividend payments, and purchases of and distributions to shareholders of noncontrolling interests.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1,070.1 in 2018, compared to $140.1 in 2017 and $133.5 in 2016. In 2018, net cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by repurchases of the Company's common stock of $935.2, net repayments of commercial paper and other debt of $559.8, dividend payments of $253.7, purchases of and distributions to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $18.2 and payments of costs related to debt financing associated with the issuances of the Euro senior notes and Euro commercial paper program of $5.6, partially offset by net cash proceeds from the October 2018 issuance of the Euro senior notes of $571.7 and cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $130.7. In 2017, net cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by repurchases of the Company's common stock of $618.0, repayment of the Company's 1.55% Senior Notes due September 2017 of $375.0, dividend payments of $205.0, purchases of and distributions to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $24.4 and payments of costs related to debt financing associated with the issuances of two series of senior notes of $5.2, partially offset by borrowings related to the issuances of two series of senior notes in April 2017 of $749.3, net borrowings under the commercial paper program of $154.1, and cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $184.1. In 2016, net cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by repurchases of the Company's common stock of $325.8, dividend payments of $172.7, distributions to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $6.8 and payments of costs related to the refinancing of our revolving credit facility of $3.0, partially offset by cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options including the related excess tax benefits of $191.6 and increased net borrowings of commercial paper of $183.2.\nThe Company has significant flexibility to meet its financial commitments. The Company uses debt financing to lower the overall cost of capital and increase return on stockholders' equity. The Company's debt financing includes the use of the commercial paper programs, the revolving credit facility and senior notes as part of its overall cash management strategy.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company had a $2,000.0 unsecured credit facility (the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d), which matured in March 2021 and gave the Company the ability to borrow at a spread over LIBOR. At December 31, 2018, there were no borrowings under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility. The 2016 Revolving Credit Facility required payment of certain annual agency and commitment fees and required that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants. At December 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility.\nOn January 15, 2019, the Company amended its 2016 Revolving Credit Facility with a new $2,500.0 unsecured credit facility ( 2019 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). The 2019 Revolving Credit Facility, which matures January 2024, increases the aggregate commitments by $500.0 and, consistent with the previous 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, gives the Company the ability to borrow at a spread over LIBOR. The Company intends to utilize the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes.\nThe Company has a commercial paper program pursuant to which the Company issues short-term unsecured commercial paper notes in one or more private placements in the United States (the U.S. Commercial Paper Program\u201d). The amount of U.S. commercial paper notes outstanding ( USCP Notes\u201d) as of December 31, 2018 was $554.5.\nOn July 10, 2018, the Company and one of its wholly owned European subsidiaries (the Euro Issuer\u201d) entered into a euro-commercial paper program (the Euro Commercial Paper Program\u201d and, together with the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the Commercial Paper Programs\u201d) pursuant to which the Euro Issuer may issue short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (the ECP Notes\u201d and, together with the USCP Notes, the Commercial Paper\u201d), which are guaranteed by the Company and are to be issued outside of the United States. The ECP Notes may be issued in Euros, Sterling, U.S. Dollars or other currencies. The amount of ECP Notes outstanding as of December 31, 2018 was \u20ac60.0 (approximately $68.8).\nAmounts available under the Commercial Paper Programs are borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors' authorization for the ECP Notes limits the maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of USCP Notes, ECP Notes, and any other commercial paper, euro-commercial paper or similar programs at any time to $2,000.0, which was then further increased to $2,500.0 in conjunction with the amended 2019 Revolving Credit Facility. The maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of USCP Notes at any time was also increased to $2,500.0, while the maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of ECP Notes at any time remains at $2,000.0. The Commercial Paper Programs are rated A-2 by Standard & Poor's and P-2 by Moody's and are currently backstopped by the Revolving Credit Facility, as amounts undrawn under the Company's existing Revolving Credit Facility are available to repay the Commercial Paper, if necessary. Net proceeds of the issuances of Commercial Paper are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. The Company reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt regularly and may replace certain amounts of commercial paper, short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt with new issuances of long-term debt in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company has outstanding senior notes (the Senior Notes\u201d) as follows:\n\nThe U.S. Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company's other unsecured senior indebtedness. Interest on each series of the U.S. Senior Notes is payable semiannually. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of any series of U.S. Senior Notes, subject to certain terms and conditions.\nOn April 5, 2017, the Company issued $400.0 principal amount of unsecured 2.20% Senior Notes due April 1, 2020 (the 2020 Senior Notes\u201d) and $350.0 principal amount of unsecured 3.20% Senior Notes due April 1, 2024 (the 2024 Senior Notes\u201d and, together with the 2020 Senior Notes, the 2020 and 2024 Notes\u201d). In September 2017, the Company used the net proceeds from the 2020 and 2024 Notes to repay all of its outstanding $375.0 principal amount of 1.55% Senior Notes due September 15, 2017, with the remainder of the net proceeds being used for general corporate purposes.\nOn October 8, 2018, the Euro Issuer issued \u20ac500.0 (approximately $574.6) principal amount of unsecured 2.000% Senior Notes due October 8, 2028 at 99.498% of face value (the 2028 Euro Notes\u201d, and collectively with the Senior Notes in the United States, Senior Notes\u201d). The 2028 Euro Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Euro Issuer's other unsecured senior indebtedness, and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company. Interest on the 2028 Euro Notes is payable annually on October 8 of each year, commencing on October 8, 2019. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 2028 Euro Notes at any time by paying 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase, and if redeemed prior to July 8, 2028, a make-whole premium. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the 2028 Euro Notes to repay a portion of the outstanding amounts under its Commercial Paper Programs, with the remainder of the net proceeds being used for general corporate purposes.\nOn January 9, 2019, the Company issued $500.0 principal amount of unsecured 4.350% Senior Notes due June 1, 2029 at 99.904% of face value (the 2029 Senior Notes\u201d). The 2029 Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company's other unsecured senior indebtedness. Interest on the 2029 Senior Notes is payable semiannually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on June 1, 2019. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 2029 Senior Notes at any time by paying 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase, and if redeemed prior to March 1, 2029, a make-whole premium. The Company used the net proceeds from the 2029 Senior Notes, along with proceeds from borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, to repay the outstanding amount of the Company's 2.55% Senior Notes due in January 2019.\nThe Company's Senior Notes contain certain financial and non-financial covenants. At December 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under its Senior Notes. Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Company's debt.\nOn April 24, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase up to $2,000.0 of the Company's Common Stock during the three-year period ending April 24, 2021 in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act (the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program\u201d). During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 6.4 million shares of its Common Stock for $553.2 under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. Approximately 5.7 million shares, or $498.2, have been retired by the Company; the remaining 0.7 million shares, or $55.0, have been retained in Treasury stock. From January 1, 2019 through January 31, 2019, the Company repurchased approximately 0.6 million additional shares of its Common Stock for $50.6, leaving approximately $1,396.2 available to purchase under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. The price and timing of any future purchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, dividends, economic and market conditions and stock price.\nOn January 24, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could purchase up to $1,000.0 of the Company's Common Stock during the two-year period ending January 24, 2019 in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act (the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program\u201d). During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 4.2 million shares of its Common Stock for $382.0, while during the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company repurchased 8.4 million shares of its Common Stock for $618.0. These shares have been retired by the Company. These repurchases of approximately 12.6 million shares for $1,000.0 completed the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program.\nIn January 2015, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could purchase up to 10 million shares of the Company's Common Stock during the two-year period ended January 20, 2017 (the 2015 Stock Repurchase Program\u201d). During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company repurchased 5.5 million shares of its Common Stock for $325.8. These shares have been retired by the Company. At December 31, 2016, the Company had repurchased all of the shares authorized under the 2015 Stock Repurchase Program.\nContingent upon declaration by the Board of Directors, the Company generally pays a quarterly dividend on shares of its Common Stock. On April 24, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors approved an increase to its quarterly dividend rate from $0.19 to $0.23 per share effective with dividends declared in the second quarter of 2018. The following table summarizes the declared quarterly dividends per share for each of the three years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\n\nThe following table summarizes the dividends declared per share as well as the dividends declared and paid for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\n\nPensions\nThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries in the United States have defined benefit pension plans ( U.S. Plans\u201d), which cover certain U.S. employees and which represent the majority of the plan assets and benefit obligations of", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(amounts in millions, except share and per share data, unless otherwise noted)\nThe following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, herein. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in U.S. dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). The following discussion and analysis also includes references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section below, including Constant Currency Net Sales Growth\u201d and Organic Net Sales Growth\u201d. For purposes of the following discussion, the terms constant currencies\u201d and organically\u201d have the same meanings as these aforementioned non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d within this Item 7 for more information, including our reasons for including non-GAAP financial measures and material limitations with respect to the usefulness of the measures.\nIn addition to historical information, the following discussion and analysis also contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the risk factors described in Item 1A herein, as well as the risks and uncertainties that exist with the use of forward-looking statements as described in the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d section included herein at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nGeneral\nThe Company is one of the world's largest designers, manufacturers and marketers of electrical, electronic and fiber optic connectors, interconnect systems, antennas, sensors and sensor-based products and coaxial and high-speed specialty cable. The Company operates through two reporting segments: (i) Interconnect Products and Assemblies and (ii) Cable Products and Solutions. In 2018, approximately 73% of the Company's sales were outside the United States. The primary end markets for our products are:\n \u00b7 information technology and communication devices and systems for the converging technologies of voice, video and data communications; \n \u00b7 a broad range of industrial applications and traditional and hybrid-electric automotive applications; and \n \u00b7 commercial aerospace and military applications. \nThe Company's products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers. The Company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time. There has been a trend on the part of customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have the ability to meet certain technical, quality, delivery and other standards while maintaining competitive prices. The Company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment. The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers.\nStrategy\nThe Company's strategy is to provide its customers with comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service on a worldwide basis while maintaining continuing programs of productivity improvement and cost control. The Company focuses its research and development efforts through close collaboration with its customers to develop highly-engineered products that meet customer needs and have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one- to three-year period. The Company is also focused on controlling costs. The Company does this by investing in modern manufacturing technologies, controlling purchasing processes and expanding into lower cost areas.\nThe Company's strategic objective is to further enhance its position in its served markets by pursuing the following success factors:\n \u00b7 Pursue broad diversification; \n \u00b7 Develop performance-enhancing interconnect solutions; \n \u00b7 Expand global presence; \n \u00b7 Control costs; \n \u00b7 Pursue strategic acquisitions and investments; and \n \u00b7 Foster collaborative, entrepreneurial management. \nIn 2018, the Company reported net sales, operating income and net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation of $8,202.0, $1,686.9 and $1,205.0, respectively, up 17%, 18% and 85%, respectively, from 2017. In 2018, the Company's net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation was impacted by the recognition of an income tax benefit of $14.5 related to the completion of the accounting for the Tax Act Charge (defined below) in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the recognition of excess tax benefits of $19.8 from stock option exercises, partially offset by acquisition-related expenses incurred during the year. In 2017, the Company's net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation was impacted by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017 which resulted in a provisional income tax charge of $398.5 as discussed in more detail below and in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements within this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in addition to the impact of the acquisition-related expenses incurred during the year, partially offset by the excess tax benefits of $66.6 recognized from stock option exercises. Excluding the effects of these items, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, as defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section below and as reconciled in Part II, Item 6 and Item 7 herein, increased by 18% and 19%, respectively, in 2018. Sales and profitability trends are discussed in detail in Results of Operations\u201d below. In addition, a strength of the Company has been its ability to consistently generate cash from operations. The Company uses cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, repurchase shares of its common stock, pay dividends and reduce indebtedness. In 2018, the Company generated operating cash flow of $1,112.7.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\nOn December 22, 2017, the United States federal government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Tax Act\u201d), marking a change from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax system in the United States. As part of this change, the Tax Act, among other changes, provides for a transition tax on the accumulated unremitted foreign earnings and profits of the Company's foreign subsidiaries ( Transition Tax\u201d) and a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded an income tax charge of $398.5 ( Tax Act Charge\u201d) that was comprised of (i) the Transition Tax of $259.4, (ii) a charge of $176.6 related to changes in the Company's permanent reinvestment assertion with regards to prior accumulated unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by (iii) a tax benefit of $37.5 associated with the remeasurement of the Company's U.S. net deferred tax liabilities due to the U.S. federal corporate tax rate reduction. As discussed under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates within this Item 7, the three components of the Tax Act Charge were provisional amounts recorded in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d). SAB 118, which is now codified under ASU 2018-05, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, addresses the application of U.S. GAAP in situations where a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. Due to the timing of the Tax Act's enactment and the complexity of its provisions, the Company had not completed its accounting for the impact of the Tax Act as of December 31, 2017. The Company analyzed guidance and technical interpretations issued in 2018 related to the provisions of the Tax Act, and refined, analyzed and updated the underlying data, computations and assumptions used to prepare the Tax Act Charge. As a result, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $14.5 in 2018 related to the completion of the accounting for the Tax Act Charge.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth the components of net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation as a percentage of net sales for the years indicated.\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCost of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n67.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n67.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n67.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAcquisition-related expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n19.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n19.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n19.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProvision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(9.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0.1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income attributable to Amphenol Corporation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 Compared to 2017\nNet sales were $8,202.0 for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $7,011.3 for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 17% in both U.S. dollars and constant currencies and 14% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts) over the prior year. Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 95% of net sales) increased 18% in U.S. dollars, 17% in constant currencies and 14% organically in 2018, compared to 2017. The sales growth was driven by growth in the mobile devices, industrial, automotive, information technology and data communications, military, mobile networks and commercial aerospace markets, partially offset by a slight decline in sales into the broadband communications market, with growth resulting primarily from organic strength, in addition to contributions from the Company's acquisitions. Net sales to the mobile devices market increased (approximately $403.6) primarily due to growth in sales of products incorporated into smartphones and related accessories, partially offset by declining sales of products incorporated into tablets. Net sales to the industrial market increased (approximately $214.9), reflecting sales strength in medical, heavy equipment, electric vehicle, railway and mass transit, and oil and gas, as well as contributions from acquisitions. Net sales to the automotive market increased (approximately $184.9), driven by growth and expansion in most regions of the global automotive market, as well as contributions from acquisitions. Net sales to the information technology and data communications market increased (approximately $166.1), reflecting organic growth in products for data centers, including server and networking-related applications, storage, and consumer electronics. Net sales to the military market increased (approximately $133.2), driven by broad strength across the market including increased sales into avionics, military communications and military airframe applications, as well as missile applications. Net sales to the mobile networks market increased (approximately $56.3), due to increased sales to both mobile networks equipment manufacturers and mobile operators. Net sales to the commercial aerospace market increased (approximately $39.6) primarily due to strength in large passenger planes. Net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 5% of net sales), which primarily serves the broadband communications market, increased 4% in U.S. dollars, 6% in constant currencies and 6% organically in 2018, compared to 2017. The increase in the Cable Products and Solutions segment was primarily due to an increase in cable products sold into the mobile networks market, which was partially offset by the slight decrease in sales into the broadband communications market.\nThe table below reconciles Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, by segment and consolidated, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017:\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercentage Growth (relative to prior year)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNet sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nForeign\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nConstant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOrganic\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ngrowth in\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncurrency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCurrency Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAcquisition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNet Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nU.S. Dollars (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nimpact (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSales Growth (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nimpact (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nGrowth (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet sales:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterconnect Products and Assemblies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,781.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,606.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCable Products and Solutions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n420.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n404.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nConsolidated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n8,202.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,011.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Net sales growth in U.S. dollars is calculated based on Net sales as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Note 11 of the accompanying financial statements. \n (2) Foreign currency translation impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from foreign currency exchange rate changes in the current year compared to the prior year. Such amount is calculated by subtracting current year net sales translated at average foreign currency exchange rates for the respective prior year from current year reported net sales, taken as a percentage of the respective prior year's net sales. \n (3) Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section. \n (4) Acquisition impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from acquisitions closed since the beginning of the prior calendar year, which were not included in the Company's results as of the comparable prior year and which do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis. \nGeographically, net sales in the United States in 2018 increased approximately 13% in U.S. dollars ($2,241.4 in 2018 versus $1,978.4 in 2017) and 9% organically, compared to 2017. Foreign sales in 2018 increased approximately 18% in U.S. dollars ($5,960.6 in 2018 versus $5,032.9 in 2017), 17% in constant currencies and 15% organically, compared to 2017 with strength in both Asia and Europe. The comparatively slightly weaker U.S. dollar in 2018 had an insignificant effect on net sales compared to 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $959.5 or 11.7% of net sales for 2018, compared to $878.3 or 12.5% of net sales for 2017. Administrative expenses increased approximately $46.4 in 2018 primarily related to increases in employee-related benefits and stock-based compensation expense, and represented approximately 4.7% of net sales in 2018 and 4.8% of net sales in 2017. Research and development expenses increased approximately $27.2 in 2018 primarily related to increases in expenses for new product development and represented approximately 2.7% of net sales in 2018 and 2.8% of net sales in 2017. Selling and marketing expenses increased approximately $7.6 in 2018 primarily related to the increase in sales volume and represented approximately 4.3% of net sales in 2018 and 4.9% of net sales in 2017.\nOperating income was $1,686.9 or 20.6% of net sales in 2018, compared to $1,427.6 or 20.4% of net sales in 2017. Operating income for 2018 and 2017 includes acquisition-related expenses of $8.5 and $4.0, respectively, related to external transaction costs. These acquisition-related expenses are separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, as defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section below, were $1,695.4 or 20.7% of net sales in 2018 and $1,431.6 or 20.4% in 2017. The increase in Adjusted Operating Margin for 2018 compared to 2017 was driven primarily by an increase in operating margin for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment in 2018 was $1,752.5 or 22.5% of net sales, compared to $1,475.2 or 22.3% of net sales in 2017. The increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by strong operating leverage on higher sales volumes. In addition, the operating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2018 was $52.6 or 12.5% of net sales, compared to $54.2 or 13.4% of net sales in 2017. The decrease in operating income margin for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by increases in certain commodity costs.\nInterest expense was $101.7 in 2018 compared to $92.3 in 2017. The increase is primarily due to higher average interest rates on the Company's U.S. Commercial Paper Program (as defined below in this Item 7) and the senior note issuances in April 2017.\nProvision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 23.4% in 2018 and 51.1% in 2017. The lower effective tax rate in 2018 compared to 2017 resulted primarily from the Tax Act Charge of $398.5 recorded in 2017, which was partially offset by the excess tax benefits of $66.6 from stock option exercises. The effects of these items were significantly lower in 2018, as the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $14.5 in 2018 related to the completion\nof the accounting for the Tax Act Charge, along with the excess tax benefits of $19.8 from stock option exercises. Excluding the effect of these items along with the effect of acquisition-related expenses in each respective year, the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section below, was 25.5% and 26.5% for 2018 and 2017, respectively, as reconciled in the table below to the comparable effective tax rate based on GAAP results. For additional details related to the reconciliation between the U.S. statutory federal tax rate and the Company's effective tax rate for these years, refer to Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNet income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Net income per common share-Diluted ( Diluted EPS\u201d) was $1,205.0 and $3.85, respectively, for 2018, compared to $650.5 and $2.06, respectively, for 2017. Excluding the effect of the aforementioned (a) Tax Act Charge in 2017 and the subsequent adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018, (b) excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in 2018 and 2017 and (c) the acquisition-related expenses incurred in both years, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Adjusted Diluted EPS, as defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section below within this Item 7, were $1,177.9 and $3.77, respectively, for 2018, compared to $986.1 and $3.12, respectively, for 2017.\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, Adjusted Effective Tax Rate and Adjusted Diluted EPS (all defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section below) to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 12% in both U.S. dollars and constant currencies and 8% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts) over the prior year. Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 94% of net sales) increased 12% in both U.S. dollars and constant currencies and 9% organically in 2017, compared to 2016. The sales growth was driven primarily by growth in the industrial, automotive, information technology and data communications, mobile devices, military and commercial aerospace markets, with contributions from both organic strength as well as from the Company's acquisitions, partially offset by a slight decline in sales in the mobile networks market. Net sales to the industrial market increased (approximately $244.4), reflecting sales strength in heavy equipment, industrial instrumentation, oil and gas, and factory automation as well as contributions from acquisitions. Net sales to the automotive market increased (approximately $177.0), driven by growth and expansion in all regions of the global automotive market, as well as contributions from acquisitions. Net sales to the information technology and data communications market increased (approximately $115.0), reflecting organic growth in products for data centers, including server and networking-related applications. Net sales to the mobile devices market increased (approximately $101.1) primarily due to growth in sales of products incorporated into smartphones and related accessories, partially offset by declining sales of products incorporated into tablets. Net sales to the military market increased (approximately $77.8), driven by broad strength across substantially all segments of the market including increased sales into military communications and military airframe applications, as well as missile applications. Net sales to the commercial aerospace market slightly increased (approximately $9.9) primarily due to the contributions from acquisitions as well as strength in large passenger planes, partially offset by continued weakness in demand for business\njets and helicopters. Net sales to the mobile networks market decreased (approximately $20.3), primarily due to reduced overall capital spending by mobile operators. Net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 6% of net sales), which is primarily in the broadband communications market, increased 11% in U.S. dollars and 10% in constant currencies in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to contributions from an acquisition made during the second half of 2016.\nThe table below reconciles Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, by segment and consolidated, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016:\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercentage Growth (relative to prior year)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNet sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nForeign\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nConstant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOrganic\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ngrowth in\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncurrency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCurrency Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAcquisition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNet Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nU.S. Dollars (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nimpact (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSales Growth (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nimpact (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nGrowth (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet sales:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterconnect Products and Assemblies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,606.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5,922.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCable Products and Solutions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n404.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n364.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nConsolidated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,011.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,286.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Net sales growth in U.S. dollars is calculated based on Net sales as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Note 11 of the accompanying financial statements. \n (2) Foreign currency translation impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from foreign currency exchange rate changes in the current year compared to the prior year. Such amount is calculated by subtracting current year net sales translated at average foreign currency exchange rates for the respective prior year from current year reported net sales, taken as a percentage of the respective prior year's net sales. \n (3) Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section. \n (4) Acquisition impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from acquisitions closed since the beginning of the prior calendar year, which were not included in the Company's results as of the comparable prior year and which do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis. \nGeographically, net sales in the United States in 2017 increased approximately 14% in U.S. dollars ($1,978.4 in 2017 versus $1,740.7 in 2016) and 8% organically, compared to 2016. Foreign sales in 2017 increased approximately 11% in U.S. dollars ($5,032.9 in 2017 versus $4,545.7 in 2016), 10% in constant currencies and 8% organically, compared to 2016 with strength in both Asia and Europe. The comparatively weaker U.S. dollar in 2017 did not significantly impact net sales compared to 2016.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $878.3 or 12.5% of net sales for 2017, compared to $798.2 or 12.7% of net sales for 2016. Administrative expenses increased approximately $28.9 in 2017 primarily related to increases in stock-based compensation expense, employee-related benefits and amortization of acquisition-related identified intangible assets, and represented approximately 4.8% of net sales in 2017 and 4.9% of net sales in 2016. Research and development expenses increased approximately $27.6 in 2017 primarily related to increases in expenses for new product development and represented approximately 2.8% of net sales in 2017 and 2.6% of net sales in 2016. Selling and marketing expenses increased approximately $23.6 in 2017 primarily related to the increase in sales volume and represented approximately 4.9% of net sales in 2017 and 5.1% of net sales in 2016.\nOperating income was $1,427.6 or 20.4% of net sales in 2017, compared to $1,205.2 or 19.2% of net sales in 2016. Operating income for 2017 includes $4.0 of acquisition-related expenses, related to external transaction costs incurred in the second quarter of 2017. Operating income for 2016 includes $36.6 of acquisition-related expenses, which includes external transaction costs, amortization related to the value associated with acquired backlog and post-closing restructuring charges related to the acquisition of FCI Asia Pte. Ltd. ( FCI\u201d), as well as transaction costs associated with other acquisitions. These acquisition-related expenses are separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, as defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section below, were $1,431.6 or 20.4% of net sales in 2017 and $1,241.8 or 19.8% in 2016. The increase in Adjusted Operating Margin for 2017 compared to 2016, was driven primarily by an increase in operating margin for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment in 2017 was $1,475.2 or 22.3% of net sales, compared to $1,280.3 or 21.6% of net sales in 2016. The increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by strong operating leverage on higher sales volumes. In addition, the operating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2017 was $54.2 or 13.4% of net sales, compared to $52.8 or 14.5% of net sales in 2016. The decrease in operating income margin for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by increases in certain commodity costs.\nInterest expense was $92.3 in 2017 compared to $72.6 in 2016. The increase is primarily due to higher average debt levels, which resulted from the Company's dividend and stock buyback programs, as well as higher average interest rates partially driven by the senior note issuances in April 2017.\nProvision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 51.1% in 2017 and 27.0% in 2016. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2017 resulted primarily from the Tax Act Charge of $398.5, partially offset by the excess tax benefits of $66.6 related to stock-based compensation. Excluding the effect of these items, the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section below, was 26.5% for both 2017 and 2016, as reconciled in the table below to the comparable effective tax rate based on GAAP results. For additional details related to the reconciliation between the U.S. statutory federal tax rate and the Company's effective tax rate for these years, refer to Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNet income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Net income per common share-Diluted ( Diluted EPS\u201d) was $650.5 and $2.06, respectively, for 2017, compared to $822.9 and $2.61, respectively, for 2016. Excluding the effect of the aforementioned (a) Tax Act Charge, (b) excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and (c) the acquisition-related expenses incurred in 2017 and 2016, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Adjusted Diluted EPS, as defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section below within this Item 7, were $986.1 and $3.12, respectively, for 2017, compared to $856.0 and $2.72, respectively, for 2016.\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, Adjusted Effective Tax Rate and Adjusted Diluted EPS (all defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section below) to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for

serve as the basis for the reconciliation to their comparable non-GAAP financial measure. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity and Cash Requirements\nAt December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1,291.7 and $1,753.7, respectively. The majority of the Company's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand as of December 31, 2018 is located outside of the United States. The Company used approximately $400, net of cash acquired, of its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2018 to fund the acquisition of SSI Controls Technologies ( SSI\u201d) in January 2019, as described below. In addition, in January 2019, the Company issued $500.0 principal amount of 4.350% Senior Notes due June 1, 2029, the net proceeds of which were used, along with borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, to repay the Company's $750.0 outstanding principal amount of 2.55% Senior Notes due in January 2019.\nPrior to the Tax Act, the Company asserted its intention to indefinitely reinvest outside of the United States all of its foreign earnings not otherwise distributed currently. For earnings occurring on or after January 1, 2018, the Tax Act's change to a modified territorial tax system in the United States has significantly reduced the U.S. tax expense associated with the remittance of foreign earnings, among other changes. The Tax Act also imposed a one-time transition tax on all of the Company's pre-2018 accumulated unremitted foreign earnings. As a result, on December 31, 2017, the Company\nrecorded a provisional U.S. tax expense for the Transition Tax, which was adjusted in 2018. This Transition Tax on the deemed repatriation of the accumulated unremitted earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, will be paid, net of applicable tax credits and deductions, in annual installments until 2025, as permitted under the Tax Act. In the second quarter of 2018, the Company paid the first annual installment of the Transition Tax of approximately $18.0.\nAs a result of the Tax Act, on December 31, 2017 the Company indicated an intention to repatriate most of its pre-2018 accumulated earnings and recorded the foreign and U.S. state and local tax costs related to the repatriation. The associated tax payments are due as the repatriations are made, and the Company made foreign and U.S. state and local payments of approximately $69.0 on repatriations in 2018. The Company intends to distribute certain 2018 foreign earnings and has accrued foreign and U.S. state and local taxes, if applicable, on those earnings as appropriate and intends to indefinitely reinvest all remaining 2018 foreign earnings. The Company intends to evaluate certain post-2018 earnings for distribution, and accrue for those distributions where appropriate, and to indefinitely reinvest all other foreign earnings.\nThe Company's primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand, the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the Euro Commercial Paper Program, and the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility (each as defined below in this Item 7). The Company believes that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment position on hand, ability to generate future cash flow from operations, availability under its credit facilities, and access to capital markets (including the recent issuance of the 2029 Senior Notes in January 2019, discussed further within this Item 7) provide adequate liquidity to meet its obligations for the next twelve months.\nThe Company's primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchases of its Common Stock, funding of pension obligations, dividends, debt service, payments associated with the Transition Tax (which is payable in annual installments until 2025) and taxes due upon the repatriation of foreign earnings (which will be payable upon the repatriation of such earnings). The Company's debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on the Company's senior notes, revolving credit facility, and commercial paper programs. The Company also may use cash to fund all or part of the cost of acquisitions, as we did with the January 2019 acquisition of SSI. The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2019 will be in a range of 3% to 4% of net sales.\nCash Flow Summary\nThe following table summarizes the Company's cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow:\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,112.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,144.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,077.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(441.8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(380.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,612.7)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,070.1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(140.1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(133.5)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(40.6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n60.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(34.0)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(439.8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n684.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(702.6)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nThe ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of the Company's fundamental financial strengths. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $1,112.7 for 2018 compared to $1,144.2 for 2017. The decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities ( Operating Cash Flow\u201d) for 2018 is primarily related to (i) certain tax payments made, primarily in the first half of 2018, related to the Tax Act Charge of approximately $87.0, including the first annual installment of the Transition Tax of approximately $18.0 in the second quarter of 2018 and payments for foreign and U.S. state and local taxes of approximately $69.0 related to foreign cash repatriated during 2018 and (ii) the Company's voluntary cash contribution of approximately $81.0 in the first quarter of 2018 to fund our U.S. defined benefit pension plans ( U.S. Plans\u201d). Excluding these items, Operating Cash Flow in 2018 increased primarily due to the increase in net income, which was partially offset by the higher usage of cash related to the change in working capital. Operating Cash Flow was $1,144.2 for 2017 compared to $1,077.6 for 2016. The increase in Operating Cash Flow in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in net income (excluding the effects of the non-cash Tax Act Charge of $398.5), which more than offset a higher usage of cash related to the change in working capital.\nIn 2018, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $362.4, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to increases in accounts receivable, inventories and other current assets of $237.9, $173.3 and $47.7, respectively, partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, including income taxes, of $48.8 and $47.7, respectively. In 2017, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $158.1, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, due primarily to increases in accounts receivable, inventories and other current assets of $146.5, $100.4 and $75.9, respectively, partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $140.5 and $24.2, respectively. In 2016, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow decreased $51.2, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, due primarily to increases in accrued income taxes, other accrued liabilities, and accounts payable of $91.7, $61.9, and $47.8, respectively, and a decrease in other current assets of $29.9, partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories of $165.9 and $14.2, respectively.\nThe following describes the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. Accounts receivable increased $193.2 to $1,791.8 primarily due to increased sales volumes in the fourth quarter of 2018 relative to the fourth quarter of 2017, partially offset by the effect of translation from exchange rate changes at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 ( Translation\u201d). Days sales outstanding at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were approximately 73 days. Inventories increased $126.9 to $1,233.8, primarily to support higher sales levels, partially offset by Translation. Inventory days at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were approximately 74 days and 76 days, respectively. Other current assets increased $57.5 to $254.3 primarily due to the increase in other receivables and prepaid expenses as well as the recording of contract assets of $25.4 as a result of the adoption of the revenue recognition standard (Topic 606, as discussed below). Property, plant and equipment, net, increased $59.0 to $875.8, primarily due to capital additions of approximately $340.2, partially offset by depreciation of $247.6, disposals and Translation. Goodwill increased $60.6 to $4,103.2 primarily as a result of goodwill recognized related to three acquisitions in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment that closed in 2018, partially offset by Translation. Intangibles, net and other long-term assets increased $5.8 to $494.3 primarily as a result of the identifiable intangible assets of $8.0 recognized related to 2018 acquisitions and an increase in deferred taxes, partially offset by the amortization of $46.9 on the Company's intangible assets and Translation. Accounts payable increased $14.9 to $890.5, primarily as a result of increased purchasing activity related to higher sales levels, which was partially offset by Translation. Payable days at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were 53 and 60, respectively. Total accrued expenses, including accrued income taxes, increased $93.8 to $796.5, primarily as a result of an increase in certain accrued employee-related compensation and benefit costs, as well as accrued income taxes, net of the tax payments of (i) the first annual installment payment of the Transition Tax and (ii) foreign and U.S. state and local taxes paid related to foreign cash repatriated. Accrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations decreased $81.8 to $190.2, primarily due to the Company's voluntary cash contribution to fund the Company's U.S. Plans. Other long-term liabilities, including deferred tax liabilities, decreased $34.8 to $532.8, primarily as a result of certain long-term tax liabilities becoming current.\nIn 2018, the Company made aggregate cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans (the Plans\u201d, which is comprised of its U.S. Plans together with its foreign plans) of approximately $88.3, of which approximately $81.0 was related to the January 2018 voluntary contribution to fund our U.S. Plans. There is no current requirement for cash contributions to any of the U.S. Plans, and the Company plans to evaluate annually, based on actuarial calculations and the investment performance of the Plans' assets, the timing and amount of cash contributions in the future.\nIn addition to Operating Cash Flow, the Company also considers Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section below, as a key metric in measuring the Company's ability to generate cash. The following table reconciles Free Cash Flow to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. The decrease in Free Cash Flow in 2018 compared to 2017 is primarily related to an increase in capital expenditures to support certain new customer programs, along with a modest decrease in Operating Cash Flow, as described above. The increase in Free Cash Flow in 2017 compared to 2016 is primarily related to an increase in Operating Cash Flow, as described above, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures.\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating Cash Flow (GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,112.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,144.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,077.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCapital expenditures (GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(310.6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(226.6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(190.8)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFree Cash Flow (non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n802.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n917.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n886.8\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with capital expenditures, proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment, sales and maturities (purchases) of short-term investments, net, and acquisitions.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $441.8 in 2018, compared to $380.2 in 2017 and $1,612.7 in 2016. In 2018, net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $305.6 and the use of $158.9 in cash to fund acquisitions, partially offset by sales and maturities of short-term investments, net of $22.7. In 2017, net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by the use of $265.5 in cash to fund acquisitions, along with capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $222.5, partially offset by sales and maturities of short-term investments, net of $107.8. In 2016, net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by the use of $1,305.1 in cash to fund acquisitions, most significantly the acquisition of FCI for $1,178.6, capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $183.7, and purchases of short-term investments, net of $123.9.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with borrowings and repayments of the Company's credit facilities and other long-term debt, repurchases of common stock, proceeds from the exercise of stock options, dividend payments, and purchases of and distributions to shareholders of noncontrolling interests.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1,070.1 in 2018, compared to $140.1 in 2017 and $133.5 in 2016. In 2018, net cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by repurchases of the Company's common stock of $935.2, net repayments of commercial paper and other debt of $559.8, dividend payments of $253.7, purchases of and distributions to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $18.2 and payments of costs related to debt financing associated with the issuances of the Euro senior notes and Euro commercial paper program of $5.6, partially offset by net cash proceeds from the October 2018 issuance of the Euro senior notes of $571.7 and cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $130.7. In 2017, net cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by repurchases of the Company's common stock of $618.0, repayment of the Company's 1.55% Senior Notes due September 2017 of $375.0, dividend payments of $205.0, purchases of and distributions to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $24.4 and payments of costs related to debt financing associated with the issuances of two series of senior notes of $5.2, partially offset by borrowings related to the issuances of two series of senior notes in April 2017 of $749.3, net borrowings under the commercial paper program of $154.1, and cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $184.1. In 2016, net cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by repurchases of the Company's common stock of $325.8, dividend payments of $172.7, distributions to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $6.8 and payments of costs related to the refinancing of our revolving credit facility of $3.0, partially offset by cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options including the related excess tax benefits of $191.6 and increased net borrowings of commercial paper of $183.2.\nThe Company has significant flexibility to meet its financial commitments. The Company uses debt financing to lower the overall cost of capital and increase return on stockholders' equity. The Company's debt financing includes the use of the commercial paper programs, the revolving credit facility and senior notes as part of its overall cash management strategy.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company had a $2,000.0 unsecured credit facility (the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d), which matured in March 2021 and gave the Company the ability to borrow at a spread over LIBOR. At December 31, 2018, there were no borrowings under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility. The 2016 Revolving Credit Facility required payment of certain annual agency and commitment fees and required that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants. At December 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility.\nOn January 15, 2019, the Company amended its 2016 Revolving Credit Facility with a new $2,500.0 unsecured credit facility ( 2019 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). The 2019 Revolving Credit Facility, which matures January 2024, increases the aggregate commitments by $500.0 and, consistent with the previous 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, gives the Company the ability to borrow at a spread over LIBOR. The Company intends to utilize the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes.\nThe Company has a commercial paper program pursuant to which the Company issues short-term unsecured commercial paper notes in one or more private placements in the United States (the U.S. Commercial Paper Program\u201d). The amount of U.S. commercial paper notes outstanding ( USCP Notes\u201d) as of December 31, 2018 was $554.5.\nOn July 10, 2018, the Company and one of its wholly owned European subsidiaries (the Euro Issuer\u201d) entered into a euro-commercial paper program (the Euro Commercial Paper Program\u201d and, together with the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the Commercial Paper Programs\u201d) pursuant to which the Euro Issuer may issue short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (the ECP Notes\u201d and, together with the USCP Notes, the Commercial Paper\u201d), which are guaranteed by the Company and are to be issued outside of the United States. The ECP Notes may be issued in Euros, Sterling, U.S. Dollars or other currencies. The amount of ECP Notes outstanding as of December 31, 2018 was \u20ac60.0 (approximately $68.8).\nAmounts available under the Commercial Paper Programs are borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors' authorization for the ECP Notes limits the maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of USCP Notes, ECP Notes, and any other commercial paper, euro-commercial paper or similar programs at any time to $2,000.0, which was then further increased to $2,500.0 in conjunction with the amended 2019 Revolving Credit Facility. The maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of USCP Notes at any time was also increased to $2,500.0, while the maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of ECP Notes at any time remains at $2,000.0. The Commercial Paper Programs are rated A-2 by Standard & Poor's and P-2 by Moody's and are currently backstopped by the Revolving Credit Facility, as amounts undrawn under the Company's existing Revolving Credit Facility are available to repay the Commercial Paper, if necessary. Net proceeds of the issuances of Commercial Paper are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. The Company reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt regularly and may replace certain amounts of commercial paper, short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt with new issuances of long-term debt in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company has outstanding senior notes (the Senior Notes\u201d) as follows:\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrincipal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nInterest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMaturity\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n750.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.55 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\nJanuary 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n400.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.20 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\nApril 2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n375.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.125 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\nSeptember 2021\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n500.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.00 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\nFebruary 2022\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n350.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.20 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\nApril 2024\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\u20ac\n</td> <td>\n500.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.00 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\nOctober 2028 (Euro Notes)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe U.S. Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company's other unsecured senior indebtedness. Interest on each series of the U.S. Senior Notes is payable semiannually. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of any series of U.S. Senior Notes, subject to certain terms and conditions.\nOn April 5, 2017, the Company issued $400.0 principal amount of unsecured 2.20% Senior Notes due April 1, 2020 (the 2020 Senior Notes\u201d) and $350.0 principal amount of unsecured 3.20% Senior Notes due April 1, 2024 (the 2024 Senior Notes\u201d and, together with the 2020 Senior Notes, the 2020 and 2024 Notes\u201d). In September 2017, the Company used the net proceeds from the 2020 and 2024 Notes to repay all of its outstanding $375.0 principal amount of 1.55% Senior Notes due September 15, 2017, with the remainder of the net proceeds being used for general corporate purposes.\nOn October 8, 2018, the Euro Issuer issued \u20ac500.0 (approximately $574.6) principal amount of unsecured 2.000% Senior Notes due October 8, 2028 at 99.498% of face value (the 2028 Euro Notes\u201d, and collectively with the Senior Notes in the United States, Senior Notes\u201d). The 2028 Euro Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Euro Issuer's other unsecured senior indebtedness, and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company. Interest on the 2028 Euro Notes is payable annually on October 8 of each year, commencing on October 8, 2019. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 2028 Euro Notes at any time by paying 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase, and if redeemed prior to July 8, 2028, a make-whole premium. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the 2028 Euro Notes to repay a portion of the outstanding amounts under its Commercial Paper Programs, with the remainder of the net proceeds being used for general corporate purposes.\nOn January 9, 2019, the Company issued $500.0 principal amount of unsecured 4.350% Senior Notes due June 1, 2029 at 99.904% of face value (the 2029 Senior Notes\u201d). The 2029 Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company's other unsecured senior indebtedness. Interest on the 2029 Senior Notes is payable semiannually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on June 1, 2019. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 2029 Senior Notes at any time by paying 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase, and if redeemed prior to March 1, 2029, a make-whole premium. The Company used the net proceeds from the 2029 Senior Notes, along with proceeds from borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, to repay the outstanding amount of the Company's 2.55% Senior Notes due in January 2019.\nThe Company's Senior Notes contain certain financial and non-financial covenants. At December 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under its Senior Notes. Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Company's debt.\nOn April 24, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase up to $2,000.0 of the Company's Common Stock during the three-year period ending April 24, 2021 in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act (the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program\u201d). During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 6.4 million shares of its Common Stock for $553.2 under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. Approximately 5.7 million shares, or $498.2, have been retired by the Company; the remaining 0.7 million shares, or $55.0, have been retained in Treasury stock. From January 1, 2019 through January 31, 2019, the Company repurchased approximately 0.6 million additional shares of its Common Stock for $50.6, leaving approximately $1,396.2 available to purchase under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. The price and timing of any future purchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, dividends, economic and market conditions and stock price.\nOn January 24, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could purchase up to $1,000.0 of the Company's Common Stock during the two-year period ending January 24, 2019 in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act (the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program\u201d). During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 4.2 million shares of its Common Stock for $382.0, while during the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company repurchased 8.4 million shares of its Common Stock for $618.0. These shares have been retired by the Company. These repurchases of approximately 12.6 million shares for $1,000.0 completed the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program.\nIn January 2015, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could purchase up to 10 million shares of the Company's Common Stock during the two-year period ended January 20, 2017 (the 2015 Stock Repurchase Program\u201d). During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company repurchased 5.5 million shares of its Common Stock for $325.8. These shares have been retired by the Company. At December 31, 2016, the Company had repurchased all of the shares authorized under the 2015 Stock Repurchase Program.\nContingent upon declaration by the Board of Directors, the Company generally pays a quarterly dividend on shares of its Common Stock. On April 24, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors approved an increase to its quarterly dividend rate from $0.19 to $0.23 per share effective with dividends declared in the second quarter of 2018. The following table summarizes the declared quarterly dividends per share for each of the three years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFirst Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.14\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSecond Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.14\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nThird Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.14\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFourth Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.16\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes the dividends declared per share as well as the dividends declared and paid for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDividends declared\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n264.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n213.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n178.8\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDividends paid (including those declared in the prior year)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n253.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n205.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n172.7\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPensions\nThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries in the United States have defined benefit pension plans ( U.S. Plans\u201d), which cover certain U.S. employees and which represent the majority of the plan assets and benefit obligations of"}
