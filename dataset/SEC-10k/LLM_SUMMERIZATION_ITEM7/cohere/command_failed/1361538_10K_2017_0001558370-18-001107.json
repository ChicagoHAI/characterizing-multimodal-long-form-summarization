This discussion includes forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties and unknown or changed circumstances. For a further discussion, please see Forward Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those risks inherent with our business as discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d.\nThe following discussion starts with an overview of our business and a discussion of trends, including seasonality, that affect our industry. That is followed by an overview of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. Next we discuss our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources, including our off-balance sheet transactions and contractual obligations. We conclude with a discussion of our outlook and backlog.\nIntroduction\nPrimoris is a holding company of various subsidiaries, which form one of the larger publicly traded specialty contractors and infrastructure companies in the United States. Serving diverse end-markets, we provide a wide range of construction, fabrication, maintenance, replacement, water and wastewater, and engineering services to major public utilities, petrochemical companies, energy companies, municipalities, state departments of transportation and other customers. We install, replace, repair and rehabilitate natural gas, refined product, water and wastewater pipeline systems; large diameter gas and liquid pipeline facilities; and heavy civil projects, earthwork and site development. We also construct mechanical facilities and other structures, including power plants, petrochemical facilities, refineries, water and wastewater treatment facilities and parking structures. Finally, we provide specialized process and product engineering services.\nWe have longstanding customer relationships with major utility, refining, petrochemical, power and engineering companies. We have completed major underground and industrial projects for a number of large natural gas transmission and petrochemical companies in the United States, as well as significant projects for our engineering customers. We enter into a large number of contracts each year, and the projects can vary in length from several weeks to as long as 60 months, or longer for completion on larger projects. Although we have not been dependent upon any one customer in any year, a small number of customers tend to constitute a substantial portion of our total revenues.\nThrough the end of the year 2016, we segregated our business into three reportable segments: the Energy segment, the East Construction Services segment and the West Construction Services segment. In the first quarter 2017, we changed our reportable segments in connection with a realignment of our internal organization and management structure. The segment changes reflect the focus of our chief operating decision maker ( CODM\u201d) on the range of services we provide to our end user markets. Our CODM regularly reviews our operating and financial performance based on these segments.\nThe current reportable segments include the Power, Industrial, and Engineering segment, the Pipeline and Underground segment, the Utilities and Distribution segment, and the Civil segment. See Note 14 - Reportable Segments\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a brief description of the reportable segments and their operations.\nThe classification of revenues and gross profit for segment reporting purposes can at times require judgment on the part of management. Our segments may perform services across industries or perform joint services for customers in\nmultiple industries. To determine reportable segment gross profit, certain allocations, including allocations of shared and indirect costs, such as facility costs, equipment costs and indirect operating expenses were made.\nThe following table lists our primary business units and their reportable segment:\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBusiness Unit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nReportable Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPrior Reportable Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nARB Industrial (a division of ARB, Inc.)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPower\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWest\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nARB Structures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPower\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWest\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrimoris Power (formerly PES Saxon division)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPower\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEnergy\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrimoris Renewable Energy (a division of Primoris AV)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPower\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEnergy\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrimoris Industrial Constructors (formerly PES Industrial Division)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPower\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEnergy\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrimoris Fabrication (a division of PES)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPower\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEnergy\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrimoris Mechanical Contractors (a combination of a division of PES and Cardinal Contractors)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPower\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEnergy\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOnQuest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPower\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEnergy\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOnQuest Canada\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPower\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEnergy\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrimoris Design and Construction ( PD&C\u201d); created 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPower\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNA\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRockford Corporation ( Rockford\u201d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPipeline\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWest\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nVadnais Trenchless Services ( Vadnais Trenchless\u201d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPipeline\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWest\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrimoris Field Services (a division of PES Primoris Pipeline)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPipeline\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEnergy\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrimoris Pipeline (a division of PES Primoris Pipeline)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPipeline\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEnergy\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrimoris Coastal Field Services; created 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPipeline\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNA\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nARB Underground (a division of ARB, Inc.)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nUtilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWest\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nQ3 Contracting ( Q3C\u201d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nUtilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWest\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrimoris AV\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nUtilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEnergy\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrimoris Distribution Services (\"PDS\"); created 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nUtilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNA\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrimoris Heavy Civil (formerly JCG Heavy Civil Division)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCivil\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEast\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrimoris I&M (formerly JCG Infrastructure & Maintenance Division)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCivil\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEast\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrimoris Build Own Operate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCivil\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEast\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe own a 50% interest in two separate joint ventures, both formed in 2015. The Carlsbad Power Constructors joint venture ( Carlsbad\u201d) is engineering and constructing a gas-fired power generation facility, and the ARB Inc. & B&M Engineering Co.\u201d joint venture ( Wilmington\u201d) is also engineering and constructing a gas-fired power generation facility. Both projects are located in Southern California. The joint venture operations are included as part of the Power segment. As a result of determining that we are the primary beneficiary of the two variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d), the results of the Carlsbad and Wilmington joint ventures are consolidated in our financial statements. Both projects are expected to be completed in 2018.\nWe owned 50% of the Blythe Power Constructors joint venture ( Blythe\u201d) created for the installation of a parabolic trough solar field and steam generation system in California, and its operations have been included as part of the Power segment. We determined that in accordance with FASB Topic 810, we were the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and have consolidated the results of Blythe in our financial statements. The project has been completed, the project warranty expired in May 2015, and dissolution of the joint venture was completed in the third quarter of 2015.\nFinancial information for the joint ventures is presented in Note 12- Noncontrolling Interests\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nWe continue to be acquisitive, and the following outlines the various acquisitions made over the past three years. See Note 4- Business Combinations\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K\nOn February 28, 2015, we acquired the net assets of Aevenia, Inc. for $22.3 million. Aevenia operations are included in the Utilities segment.\nOn January 29, 2016, we acquired the net assets of Mueller Concrete Construction Company (\"Mueller\") for $4.1 million, and on November 18, 2016, we acquired the net assets of Northern Energy & Power ( Northern\u201d) for $6.9 million. On June 24, 2016, we purchased property, plant and equipment from Pipe Jacking Unlimited, Inc. ( Pipe Jacking\u201d), consisting of specialty directional drilling and tunneling equipment for $13.4 million. We determined this purchase did not meet the definition of a business as defined under ASC 805. Mueller operations are included in the Utilities segment, Northern operations are included in the Power segment, and Pipe Jacking operations are included in the Pipeline segment.\nOn May 26, 2017, we acquired the net assets of Florida Gas Contractors ( FGC\u201d) for $37.7 million; on May 30, 2017, we acquired certain engineering assets for approximately $2.3 million; and on June 16, 2017, we acquired the net assets of Coastal Field Services ( Coastal\u201d) for $27.5 million. FGC operations are included in the Utilities segment, the engineering assets are included in the Power segment, and Coastal operations are included in the Pipeline segment.\nIn August 2017, we announced we are investing approximately $22.0 million to build, own, and operate a portfolio of solar projects in a California School District acquired from the developers, Spear Point Energy, LLC, and PFMG Solar, LLC. This investment amount includes the estimated cost of Engineering, Procurement, and Construction ( EPC\u201d) work on the projects, which is projected to be completed in 2018. The solar projects are expected to generate a 25-year recurring revenue stream from the District's signed power purchase agreement. As an investment in a renewable energy project, the solar assets should provide us with investment tax credits valued at over $5.0 million. As of December 31, 2017, our investment for the solar projects was approximately $9.9 million. The $9.9 million investment is our construction in progress on the solar projects and is included in Property and equipment, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nMaterial trends and uncertainties\nWe generate our revenue from both large and small construction and engineering projects. The award of these contracts is dependent on many factors, most of which are not within our control. We depend in part on spending by companies in the energy and oil and gas industries, the gas utility industry, as well as municipal water and wastewater customers. Over the past several years, each segment has benefited from demand for more efficient and more environmentally friendly energy and power facilities, local highway and bridge needs and from the activity level in the oil and gas industry. However, periodically, each of these industries and government agencies is adversely affected by macroeconomic conditions. Economic factors outside of our control may affect the amount and size of contracts we are awarded in any particular period.\nWe closely monitor our customers to assess the effect that changes in economic, market and regulatory conditions may have on them. We have experienced reduced spending by some of our customers over the last several years, which we attribute to negative economic and market conditions, and we anticipate that these negative conditions may continue to affect demand for our services in the near-term. Fluctuations in market prices of oil, gas and other fuel sources have affected demand for our services. While we have seen signs of a recovery in the price of oil, the significant volatility in the price of oil, gas and liquid natural gas that occurred in the past few years has created uncertainty with respect to demand for our oil and gas pipeline services both in the near-term and for future projects. We believe that our upstream operations, such as the construction of gathering lines within the oil shale formations, will remain at lower levels for an extended period. While there was some stability in the price of oil in 2017, that stability has not resulted in a significant change in the contracting activities of our customers. We believe that over time, the need for pipeline infrastructure for mid-stream and gas utility companies will result in a continuing need for our services, but the impact of the low oil prices may delay midstream pipeline opportunities. The continuing changes in the regulatory environment also affect the demand for our services, either by increasing our work or delaying projects. For example, the regulatory environment in California may result in delays for the construction of gas-fired power plants while regulators continue to search for significant renewable resources, but renewable resources may also create a demand for our construction services such as the need for storage of renewable generated electricity. Finally, we believe that regulated utility customers will continue to invest in our maintenance and replacement services.\nSeasonality, cyclicality and variability\nOur results of operations are subject to quarterly variations. Some of the variation is the result of weather, particularly rain, ice and snow, which can impact our ability to perform construction services. While the majority of our work is in the southern half of the United States, these seasonal impacts can affect revenues and profitability in all of our businesses since gas and other utilities defer routine replacement and repair during their period of peak demand. Any quarter can be affected either negatively or positively by atypical weather patterns in any part of the country. In addition, demand for new projects tends to be lower during the early part of the year due to clients' internal budget cycles. As a result, we usually experience higher revenues and earnings in the third and fourth quarters of the year as compared to the first two quarters.\nWe are also dependent on large construction projects which tend not to be seasonal, but can fluctuate from year to year based on general economic conditions. Our business may be affected by declines or delays in new projects or by client project schedules. Because of the cyclical nature of our business, the financial results for any period may fluctuate from prior periods, and our financial condition and operating results may vary from quarter to quarter. Results from one quarter may not be indicative of financial condition or operating results for any other quarter or for an entire year.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGeneral-The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and also affect the amounts of revenues and expenses reported for each period. These estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available, is dependent on future events, or is not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. Often, estimates are particularly difficult to determine, and we must exercise significant judgment. Estimates may be used in our assessments of revenue recognition under percentage-of-completion accounting, the allowance for doubtful accounts, useful lives of property and equipment, fair value assumptions in analyzing goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, self-insured claims liabilities and deferred income taxes. Actual results could differ from those that result from using the estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nThe following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Management's estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. We periodically review these accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nRevenue recognition-We generate revenue under a range of contracting options, including fixed-price, unit-price, time and material, and cost reimbursable plus fee contracts. A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from contracts that are fixed-price or unit-price, using the percentage-of-completion method. For time and material and cost reimbursable plus fee contracts, revenue is recognized primarily based on contractual terms. Generally, time and material and cost reimbursable contract revenues are recognized on an input basis, based on labor hours incurred and on purchases made.\nIn the percentage-of-completion method, estimated contract values, estimated cost at completion and total costs incurred to date are used to calculate revenues earned. Unforeseen events and circumstances can alter the estimate of the costs and potential profit associated with a particular contract. Total estimated costs, and thus contract revenues and income, can be impacted by changes in productivity, scheduling, the unit cost of labor, subcontracts, materials and equipment. Additionally, external factors such as weather, client needs, client delays in providing permits and approvals,\nlabor availability, governmental regulation and politics may affect the progress of a project's completion and thus the timing of revenue recognition.\nTo the extent that original cost estimates are modified, estimated costs to complete increase, delivery schedules are delayed, or progress under a contract is otherwise impeded, cash flow, revenue recognition and profitability from a particular contract may be adversely affected. As a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts, we review and update our contract-related estimates regularly. We recognize adjustments in estimated profit on contracts as changes in accounting estimates in the period in which the revisions are identified. Revenue and profit in future periods of contract performance are recognized using the adjusted estimate.\nIf at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on a contract, the projected loss is recognized in full in the period it is identified and recognized as an accrued loss provision\u201d which is included in the accrued expenses and other current liabilities amount on the balance sheet. For contract revenue recognized under the percentage-of-completion method, the accrued loss provision is adjusted so that the gross profit for the contract remains zero in future periods. The provision for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts was $10.1 million and $12.8 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nWe consider unapproved change orders to be contract variations for which customers have not agreed to both scope and price. Costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in the estimated cost to complete and are treated as project costs as incurred. We will recognize a change in contract value if we believe it is probable that the contract price will be adjusted and can be reliably estimated. Unapproved change orders involve the use of estimates, and it is reasonably possible that revisions to the estimated costs and recoverable amounts may be required in future reporting periods to reflect changes in estimates or final agreements with customers.\nWe consider claims to be amounts we seek, or will seek, to collect from customers or others for customer-caused changes in contract specifications or design, or other customer-related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs on which there is no agreement with customers. Claims can also be caused by non-customer-caused changes, such as rain or other weather delays. Costs associated with claims are included in the estimated costs to complete the contracts and are treated as project costs when incurred. Claims are included in revenue to the extent we have a reasonable legal basis, the related costs have been incurred, realization is probable, and amounts can be reliably estimated. Revenue in excess of contract costs from claims is recognized after an agreement is reached with customers as to the value of the claims, which in some instances may not occur until after completion of work under the contract.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had unapproved change orders and claims included in the expected contract value that totaled approximately $67.8 million. These claims were in the process of being negotiated in the normal course of business. Approximately $56.7 million of unapproved change orders and claims had been recognized as revenue on a cumulative percentage-of-completion basis through December 31, 2017.\nIn all forms of contracts, we estimate the collectability of contract amounts at the same time that we estimate project costs. If we anticipate that there may be issues associated with the collectability of the full amount calculated as revenues, we may reduce the amount recognized as revenue to reflect the uncertainty associated with realization of the eventual cash collection. For example, when a cost reimbursable project exceeds the client's expected budget amount, the client frequently requests an adjustment to the final amount. Similarly, some utility clients reserve the right to audit costs for significant periods after performance of the work. In these situations, we may choose to defer recognition of a portion of the revenue until the client pays for the services.\nThe caption Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings\u201d in the Consolidated Balance Sheets represents unbilled receivables which arise when revenues have been recorded but the amount will not be billed until a later date. Balances represent: (a) unbilled amounts arising from the use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting which may not be billed under the terms of the contract until a later date or project milestone; (b) incurred costs to be billed under cost reimbursable type contracts, including amounts arising from routine lags in billing; or (c) the revenue associated with unapproved change orders or claims when realization is probable and amounts can be reliably estimated. For those contracts in which billings exceed contract revenues recognized to date, the excess amounts are included in the caption Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings\u201d.\nIn accordance with applicable terms of certain construction contracts, retainage amounts may be withheld by customers until completion and acceptance of the project. Some payments of the retainage may not be received for a significant period after completion of our portion of a project. In some jurisdictions, retainage amounts are deposited into an escrow account.\nValuation of acquired businesses-We use the fair value of the consideration paid and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to account for the purchase price of businesses. The determination of fair value requires estimates and judgments of future cash flow expectations for the assignment of the fair values to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets.\nIdentifiable Tangible Assets. Significant identifiable tangible assets acquired would include accounts receivable, costs and earnings in excess of billings for projects, inventory and fixed assets (generally consisting of construction equipment) for each acquisition. We determine the fair value of these assets as of the acquisition date. For current assets and current liabilities of an acquisition, we will evaluate whether the book value is equivalent to fair value due to their short term nature. We estimate the fair value of fixed assets using a market approach, based on comparable market values for similar equipment of similar condition and age.\nIdentifiable Intangible Assets. When necessary, we use the assistance of an independent third party valuation specialist to determine the fair value of the intangible assets acquired in the acquisitions.\nA liability for contingent consideration based on future earnings is estimated at its fair value at the date of acquisition, with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in earnings as a gain or loss. Fair value is estimated as of the acquisition date using estimated earnout payments based on management's best estimate.\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States provide a measurement period\u201d of up to one year in which to finalize all fair value estimates associated with the acquisition of a business. Most estimates are preliminary until the end of the measurement period. During the measurement period, adjustments to initial valuations and estimates that reflect newly discovered information that existed at the acquisition date are recorded. After the measurement date, any adjustments would be recorded as a current period gain or loss.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived intangible Assets-Goodwill and certain intangible assets acquired in a business combination and determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are assessed for impairment annually and more frequently if triggering events occur. In performing these assessments, management relies on various factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable transactions and other market data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill for impairment. Since judgment is involved in performing fair value measurements used in goodwill impairment analyses, there is risk that the carrying values of our goodwill may not be properly stated.\nWe account for goodwill, including evaluation of any goodwill impairment under ASC 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other\u201d, performed at the reporting unit level for those units with recorded goodwill as of October 1 of each year, unless there are indications requiring a more frequent impairment test.\nGoodwill has arisen from acquisitions and is recorded at our segments as follows at December 31 (in thousands):\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReporting Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPower\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n24,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n24,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPipeline\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n51,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n42,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUtilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n37,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCivil\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n40,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n40,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Goodwill\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n153,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n127,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnder ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other\u201d, we can assess qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative impairment test of intangible assets is necessary. Typically, however, we use the two-step impairment test outlined in ASC 350. First, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. Fair value for the goodwill impairment test is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on our financial plan discounted using our weighted average cost of capital and market indicators of terminal year cash flows. Other valuation methods may be used to corroborate the discounted cash flow method. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit is in excess of its fair value, goodwill is considered potentially impaired and further tests are performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. In the second step of the goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination was determined. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill.\nDuring the third quarter of 2016, we made a decision to divest the Texas heavy civil business unit, a division of Primoris Heavy Civil within the Civil segment. We engaged a financial advisor to assist in the marketing and sale of the business unit, and planned to continue operating the business unit until completion of a sale. In April 2017, the Board of Directors determined that based on the information available, we would attain the best long-term value by withdrawing from the sales process and continuing to operate the business unit.\nUnder the provisions of ASC 350, the planned divestiture triggered an analysis of the goodwill amount of Primoris Heavy Civil. The analysis resulted in a pretax, non-cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately $2.7 million in the third quarter of 2016.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, an impairment expense of $0.4 million was recorded relating to the goodwill attributed to Cardinal Contractors, Inc., which is a part of the Power segment. There were no other impairments of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nDisruptions to our business, such as end market conditions, protracted economic weakness, unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units and the divestiture of a significant component of a reporting unit, may result in our having to perform a goodwill impairment first step valuation analysis for some or all of our reporting units prior to the required annual assessment. These types of events and the resulting analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in any periods in the future.\nReserve for uninsured risks-Estimates are inherent in the assessment of our exposure to uninsured risks. Significant judgments by us and, where possible, third-party experts are needed in determining probable and/or reasonably estimable amounts that should be recorded or disclosed in the financial statements. Semiannually, we obtain a third-party actuarial valuation for some of our uninsured risks. The results of any changes in accounting estimates are reflected in the financial statements of the period in which we determine we need to record a change.\nWe self-insure worker's compensation claims up to $0.25 million per claim. We maintained a self-insurance reserve totaling approximately $18.5 million at December 31, 2017 and approximately $18.8 million at December 31, 2016. Claims administration expenses were charged to current operations as incurred. Our accruals are based on judgment, the probability of losses, and where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and third party consultants. The amount is included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities\u201d on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Actual payments that may be made in the future could materially differ from such reserves.\nIncome taxes-We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method as set forth in ASC 740, Income Taxes\u201d, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and tax bases of\nassets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of changes in tax rates on net deferred tax assets or liabilities is recognized as an increase or decrease in net income in the period the tax change is enacted.\nDeferred tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance if, in the judgment of our management, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available evidence, including recent financial operations, projected future taxable income, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies, and the length of tax asset carryforward periods. The realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable earnings in certain jurisdictions. If we subsequently determine that some or all deferred tax assets that were previously offset by a valuation allowance are realizable, the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased by reducing the valuation allowance, thereby increasing income in the period when that determination is made. During 2017, we determined it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax asset for foreign tax credits will not be realized. Accordingly, a valuation allowance of $0.6 million was recorded.\nA tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained based on its technical merits in a tax examination, using the presumption that the tax authority has full knowledge of all relevant facts regarding the position. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on ultimate settlement with the tax authority. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test, no tax benefit is recorded.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act-On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that affect our 2017 results, including the allowance of bonus depreciation that provides for immediate deduction of qualified property placed in service after September 27, 2017. The Tax Act also establishes new tax laws that may affect our 2018 and future results, including but not limited to:\nTable 77: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nReduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThe repeal of the domestic production activities deduction;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFurther limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDisallowance of certain entertainment expense deductions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLimitations on the use of foreign tax credits to reduce the U.S. income tax liability;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLimitations on interest expense deductibility;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nElimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhile the Tax Act also contains complex changes to the tax code for companies operating internationally, we are not materially impacted by the international provisions of the Tax Act.\nGiven the significant impact of the legislation, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB\u201d) 118 which provides guidance on accounting for uncertainties of the effects of the Tax Act. Specifically, SAB 118 allows companies to record provisional estimates of the impact of the Tax Act during a one year measurement period\u201d similar to that used when accounting for business combinations.\nAs a result of the Tax Act, we remeasured our deferred tax assets and liabilities using the newly enacted tax rates and recorded a one-time net tax benefit of $9.4 million in the period ended December 31, 2017. This tax benefit is a provisional estimate that could be revised once we finalize our deductions for tax depreciation and executive compensation accruals. We may also revise our estimate based on any additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, and other standard-setting bodies.\nLong-Lived Assets-Assets held and used by us, primarily property, plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable. We perform an undiscounted operation cash flow analysis to determine if an impairment exists. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identified. If an impairment is determined to exist, any related\nimpairment loss is calculated based on fair value. The calculation of the fair value of long-lived assets is based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of long-lived assets, the future carrying value of our long-lived assets may have differing future fair values.\nMultiemployer plans - Various subsidiaries are signatories to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements require that we participate in and contribute to a number of multiemployer benefit plans for our union employees at rates determined by the agreements. The trustees for each multiemployer plan determine the eligibility and allocations of contributions and benefit amounts, determine the types of benefits, and administer the plan. To the extent that any plans are underfunded, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, requires that if we were to withdraw from an agreement or if a plan is terminated, we may incur a withdrawal obligation. Since the withdrawal liability is based on estimates of our proportional share of the plan's unfunded vested liability, as calculated by the plan's actuaries, the potential withdrawal obligation may be significant.\nIn November 2011, members of the Pipe Line Contractors Association PLCA\u201d including ARB, Rockford and Q3C (prior to our acquisition in 2012), withdrew from the Central States Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund multiemployer pension plan ( Plan\u201d). These withdrawals were made in order to mitigate additional liability in connection with the significantly underfunded Plan. We recorded a withdrawal liability of $7.5 million, which was increased to $7.6 million after the acquisition of Q3C. During the first quarter of 2016, we received a final payment schedule. As a result of payments made and based on this schedule, the liability recorded at December 31, 2017 was $4.7 million. We expect to pay the remaining liability balance during 2018 and have no plans to withdraw from any other labor agreements.\nLitigation and contingencies-Litigation and contingencies are included in our consolidated financial statements based on our assessment of the expected outcome of litigation proceedings or the expected resolution of the contingency. We provide for costs related to contingencies when a loss from such claims is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. In determining whether it is possible to provide an estimate of loss, or range of possible loss, we review and evaluate litigation and regulatory matters on a quarterly basis in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. If we determine an unfavorable outcome is not probable or reasonably estimable, we do not accrue for a potential litigation loss. Management is unable to ascertain the ultimate outcome of other claims and legal proceedings; however, after review and consultation with counsel and taking into consideration relevant insurance coverage and related deductibles/self-insurance retention, management believes that it has meritorious defense to the claims and believes that the reasonably possible outcome of such claims will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. See Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Results\nTwo events had a material impact on our results of operations in 2016. In the third quarter we received a $38.0 million settlement for one of the construction projects that we had identified as part of our Receivable Collection Actions\u201d, discussed below. Because we had recorded the project with zero gross profit, the settlement added $27.5 million to revenues and $26.7 million to gross profit. Also in the third quarter, we recorded a charge of $37.3 million primarily related to certain Belton, Texas area projects for the Texas Department of Transportation ( TXDOT\u201d), as a result of project delays and productivity issues.\nRevenues\n2017 and 2016\nRevenues for year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $383.0 million, or 19.2%, compared to 2016. All segments reported year over year growth. Progress on three major pipeline jobs ($83.6 million), higher activity with major utility clients in California and the Midwest ($135.6 million) and progress on our joint venture power plant projects in Southern California and a Mid-Atlantic power plant project ($158.2 million combined) drove higher 2017 revenue. Also contributing to 2017 growth was higher volume on our Belton area (Civil) projects and a Louisiana methanol plant project. The overall increase was partially offset by decreases associated with projects substantially completed in 2017 and revenue recognized from the one-time benefit of the settlement of one of the Receivable Collection Actions\u201d in 2016. Revenue from 2017 acquisitions and incremental revenue from 2016 acquisitions (where we only owned a business for a portion of the year) totaled $53.6 million.\n2016 and 2015\nRevenues for year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $67.5 million, or 3.5% compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $64.1 million from Rockford's pipeline work, $34.5 million for work at a large petrochemical project in Louisiana and $35.4 million from a new collaboration MSA arrangement at ARB Underground. These increases were partially offset by a revenue reduction of $50.1 million at OnQuest, a reduction of $16.4 million at Saxon, and a reduction of $24.5 million in Heavy Civil projects. Revenues for 2016 also included the one-time benefit of $27.5 million from the settlement of one of the Receivable Collection Actions\u201d.\nAs discussed in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d, we had unapproved change orders and claims included in contract value that totaled approximately $67.8 million at December 31, 2017. Of this amount, approximately $49.7 million was claims related to the Belton area projects.\nGross Profit\n2017 and 2016\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, gross profit increased by $77.1 million, or 38.3%, compared to 2016. All segments reported year over year improvement. Strong revenue growth and the favorable performance on the two large pipeline projects in Florida drove significant improvement. Also benefiting 2017 were higher volumes for the Power segment and better performance from Civil. The year over year increase was partially offset by $26.7 million of gross profit recognized in 2016 from the settlement of one of the Receivable Collection Actions\u201d. Gross Profit from 2017 acquisitions and incremental gross profit from 2016 acquisitions (where we only owned a business for a portion of the year) totaled $8.6 million. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 11.7% in 2017 from 10.1% in 2016 for the reasons noted above.\n2016 and 2015\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, gross profit decreased by $18.6 million, or 8.4% compared to 2015. The decrease was primarily from the decrease in Heavy Civil projects of $38.2 million, of which $33.4 million was from a decrease at the Belton area projects. Gross profit decreased by $6.1 million at the Louisiana petrochemical project, in spite of an increase in revenue, as the scope of our work has changed to less equipment intensive, lower margin work. Gross profit also decreased at ARB Underground by $6.3 million and $8.6 million at ARB Industrial with these decreases offset by a gross profit increase of $15.4 million at Rockford. Our gross profit benefitted by $26.7 million from the settlement of one of the Receivable Collection Actions\u201d. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased from 11.4% in 2015 to 10.1% in 2016 for the reasons noted above.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A\u201d) consist primarily of compensation and benefits to executive, management level and administrative employees, marketing and communications, professional fees, office rent and utilities and acquisition costs.\n2017 and 2016\nFor 2017, SG&A expenses were $172.1 million, compared to $140.8 million for 2016, an increase of $31.3 million. Approximately $12.4 million of the increase in SG&A is related to businesses acquired in 2017 and a full year of expense in 2017 for the Northern acquisition compared to less than two months of expense in 2016. The remaining increase was primarily due to a $12.6 million increase in compensation related expenses, including incentive compensation accruals; and a $1.3 million increase in legal costs.\nSG&A as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased slightly to 7.2% compared to 7.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, SG&A as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, decreased slightly to 6.9% compared to 7.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n2016 and 2015\nFor 2016, SG&A expenses were $140.8 million, compared to $151.7 million for 2015, a decrease of $10.9 million. The decrease was primarily as a result of decreases in professional fees of $7.4 million due to reduced legal fees and due to completion of the implementation of the integrated financial system. The reduction in SG&A was also the result of a $2.6 million prior year one-time valuation adjustment for the value of a long-term asset. Additionally, SG&A was reduced as a result of a decrease of $1.8 million in compensation and staffing levels.\nSG&A as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased to 7.1% compared to 7.9% for the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of the decreased expenses while revenues increased.\nOther income and expense\nNon-operating income and expense items for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvestment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nForeign exchange gain (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0.8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0.3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(8.1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(8.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(7.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal other income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(1.0)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(8.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(6.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment income for the year ended December 31, 2017 is related to a gain from a short-term investment in marketable equity securities.We purchased the securities in the third quarter of 2017 and sold the securities in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nForeign exchange gains and losses reflect currency exchange fluctuations of the United States dollar compared to the Canadian dollar. Many of our contracts in Calgary, Canada are sold based on United States dollars, but a portion of the work is paid for with Canadian dollars creating a currency exchange difference.\nOther income for 2017 was $0.5 million compared to other expense of $0.3 million for 2016. The $0.8 million change was primarily due to remeasurement of the contingent consideration related to the FGC performance target contemplated in their purchase agreement. Under ASC 805, we are required to estimate the fair value of contingent consideration based on facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and remeasure to fair value at each\nreporting date until the contingency is resolved. As a result of that remeasurement, we reduced the contingent consideration liability by $0.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Other expense for 2016 was $0.3 million compared to other income of $1.7 million for 2015. The $2.0 million change was primarily due to the net reversal of $1.9 million of contingent consideration in 2015 as Ram-Fab, Vadnais and Surber missed financial targets contemplated in their respective purchase agreements.\nInterest income is derived from interest earned on excess cash invested primarily in short term U.S. Treasury bills, backed by the federal government.\nInterest expense decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a lower average debt balance. Interest expense increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a higher average debt balance. The weighted average interest rate on total debt outstanding at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was 3.0%, 2.9% and 2.9%, respectively.\nProvision for income taxes\nOur provision for income tax increased $7.3 million to $28.4 million for 2017 compared to 2016. Increased pretax profits in 2017 of $53.0 million drove an increase in income tax of $23.4 million using the 2016 effective tax rate. This increase in income tax was offset by a $9.4 million decrease in income tax from the remeasurement of our U.S. deferred tax liability and a $6.7 million decrease due to a decrease in 2017 effective tax rates. The remeasurement benefit is a provisional estimate under SAB 118 that could be revised once we finalize our deductions for tax depreciation and executive compensation accruals. We may also revise our estimate based on any additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, and other standard-setting bodies.\nThe 2017 effective tax rate on income including noncontrolling interests was 27.0%. The 2017 effective tax rate on income attributable to Primoris (excluding noncontrolling interests) was 28.2%. Three factors contributed to the decrease in the 2017 effective tax rate compared to 2016. First, state effective tax rates decreased due to changes in the mix of profit by state and the implementation of state tax planning. Second, partially nondeductible per diem expenses stayed relatively constant year over year despite the increase in pretax profits. Lastly, the benefit of the domestic production activities deduction increased compared to 2016.\nOur provision for income tax decreased $2.8 million to $21.1 million for 2016 compared to 2015 primarily as a result of the decrease in pretax profits.\nSegment Results\nPower Segment\nRevenue and gross profit for the Power segment for the years ending December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSegment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSegment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSegment\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPower Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n606.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n478.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n466.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n65.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.8% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n49.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.4% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n53.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11.5% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 and 2016\nRevenue increased by $127.5 million, or 26.6%, during 2017 compared to 2016. The growth is primarily due to progress on our joint venture power plant projects in Southern California ($115.3 million), a power plant construction project in the Mid-Atlantic region that began late in the third quarter of 2016 ($42.9 million) and a methane plant project in Texas that started in 2017. In addition, we benefited from acquisitions completed in November 2016 and May 2017 ($20.3 million). The overall increase was partially offset by the substantial completion of a large petrochemical plant in Louisiana in the second quarter of 2017 ($42.0 million) and the completion of two large parking structures in 2016.\nGross profit increased by $15.9 million, or 31.9%, during 2017 compared to 2016. The increase is primarily attributable to the revenue growth and the impact of acquired operations ($1.6 million). Gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 10.8% in 2017 compared to 10.4% in 2016 primarily as a result of an improved revenue mix.\n2016 and 2015\nRevenue increased by $12.3 million, or 2.6%, during 2016 compared to 2015. The increase is primarily due to a $60.6 million increase at Primoris Industrial Constructors from a large petrochemical project in Louisiana, partially offset by a $50.1 million decrease at OnQuest and OnQuest Canada from the completion of projects in 2015 that were not fully replaced in 2016.\nGross profit decreased by $3.8 million, or 7.1%, during 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease is primarily due to a $8.6 million reduction at ARB Industrial from a reduction in revenues and a decrease of $6.7 million at OnQuest and OnQuest Canada as a result of reducted volumes. These decreases are partially offset by an $11.6 million increase at Primoris Industiral Constructors from increased volume at the large petrochemical project in Louisiana.\nGross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to 10.4% in 2016 compared to 11.5% in 2015. The decline in margin is largely attributable to the low margin percentage realized by two joint venture projects in process, which accounted for 5.6% of the Power segment's revenues in 2016 versus 0.9% in 2015.\nPipeline and Underground Segment\nRevenue and gross profit for the Pipeline segment for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSegment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSegment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSegment\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPipeline Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n465.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n401.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n299.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n92.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n19.8% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n68.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n16.9% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n24.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8.2% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs discussed in the section Receivable Collection Actions\u201d, during the third quarter of 2016, we collected a disputed receivable related to a major pipeline project completed in 2014, which resulted in recognizing revenue of approximately $27.5 million and gross profit of approximately $26.7 million. The following discussion excludes the impact of this collection, which was a one-time item.\n2017 and 2016\nRevenue increased by $91.2 million, or 24.4%, during 2017 compared to 2016. The increase is primarily due to two large pipeline jobs in Florida, which began in the third quarter of 2016 ($31.6 million) and activity on a pipeline project in Pennsylvania that began in 2017 ($52.0 million). In addition, impact of the acquired Coastal operations ($17.9 million) also benefited 2017. The overall increase was partially offset by a reduction in maintenance work ($31.1 million).\nGross profit increased by $50.7 million, or 122.5%, during 2017 compared to 2016. The increase is attributable to the combination of revenue growth and our strong performance on the two pipeline jobs in Florida, where we experienced good weather conditions resulting in no weather delays and high productivity. In addition, the acquisition of Coastal in 2017 contributed gross profit of $3.2 million. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to 19.8% in 2017 compared to 11.1% in 2016. The increase is due to the good weather conditions noted above, which is not common and not to be expected in the future.\n2016 and 2015\nRevenue increased by $75.0 million, or 25.1%, during 2016 compared to 2015. The increase is primarily due to a $64.1 million increase at Rockford from two large pipeline projects in Florida which started in the third quarter of 2016 and a $6.1 million increase at Primoris Pipeline from several smaller diameter pipeline projects in Texas.\nGross profit increased by $16.7 million, or 67.6%, during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a $15.4 million increase from the Rockford Florida projects described above. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 11.1% in 2016 compared to 8.2% in 2015 primarily as a result of the increase in revenues.\nUtilities Segment\nRevenue and gross profit for the Utilities segment for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSegment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSegment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSegment\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUtilities Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n806.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n637.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n587.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n113.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14.0% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n100.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15.7% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n96.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n16.4% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 and 2016\nRevenue increased by $169.3 million, or 26.6%, during 2017 compared to 2016. The increase is primarily attributable to higher activity with two major utility customers in California ($67.7 million) and two major utility customers in the Midwest ($32.3 million). In addition, higher revenue from a collaboration MSA arrangement for a major utility customer in California ($35.6 million) and the impact of the acquired FGC operations ($15.5 million) also benefited 2017.\nGross profit increased $12.9 million, or 12.9%, during 2017 compared to 2016. The increase is primarily due the growth in revenue and the impact of acquired operations. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to 14.0% in 2017 compared to 15.7% in 2016 primarily as a result of lower gross margins on the collaboration MSA work.\n2016 and 2015\nRevenue increased by $50.2 million, or 8.6%, during 2016 compared to 2015. The increase is primarily due to a $35.4 million increase at ARB Underground from a new collaboration MSA arrangement as well as a $12.1 million increase at Q3C from increased volume.\nGross profit increased by $3.6 million, or 3.7%, during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to increased profitability at Q3C. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to 15.7% in 2016 compared to 16.4% in 2015.

The following discussion excludes the impact of the write-down.\n2017 and 2016\nRevenue increased by $22.6 million, or 4.7%, during 2017 compared to 2016. The increase is primarily due to progress on a methanol plant project in Louisiana that began in 2017 ($31.9 million) and higher volume on the Belton area projects ($23.3 million). The overall increase was partially offset by substantial completion of a large petrochemical plant project in Lousiana in the first half of 2017.\nGross profit decreased by $13.0 million, or 63.1%, during 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease was primarily due to higher costs on two Arkansas DOT projects and one Louisiana DOT project, despite the revenue increase.\nGross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to 1.5% in 2017 compared to 4.3% in 2016. The decrease was primarily the result of the project cost impacts noted above.\nRevenue at the Belton area projects was $144.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, representing 28.9% of total Civil revenue. Revenue for which no margin was recognized was $134.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, of which $78.6 million was from the Belton area projects. During 2017, the four Belton area jobs in a loss position contributed $2.4 million gross profit as a result of lower anticipated costs. Two of the Belton area jobs in a loss position were completed during 2017, and the remaining two loss jobs are schedule to be completed in 2018. At December 31, 2017, the accrued loss provision for the four Belton area projects was $5.0 million and estimated remaining revenue for the two open jobs in a loss position was $49.0 million. The remaining Belton area job contributed $0.3 million gross profit during the year ended December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2017, estimated revenue for the job was $88.0 million, with completion scheduled for early 2019.\n2016 and 2015\nRevenue decreased by $97.5 million, or 16.9%, during 2016 compared to 2015. Revenue at Primoris I&M ( I&M\u201d) decreased by $76.4 million due primarily to the large petrochemical project in Louisiana and decreases in Texas I&M work. Primoris Heavy Civil division revenue decreased by $24.5 million. Decreases in Louisiana DOT projects of $19.4 million and Mississippi DOT projects of $58.9 million were offset by increases in Arkansas DOT projects of $6.7 million, Texas DOT projects of $8.4 million and airport projects of $31.7 million.\nGross profit decreased by $24.5 million, or 54.3%, during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to decreased revenue at Primoris I&M.\nGross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to 4.3% in 2016 compared to 7.8% in 2015 primarily as a result of the decrease in revenues.\nPlanned Divestiture of Texas Heavy Civil Business Unit\nIn October 2016, we announced that we planned to divest our Texas heavy civil business unit, which operates as a division of Primoris Heavy Civil. We engaged a financial advisor to assist in the marketing and sale of the business unit, and planned to continue to operate the business unit until completion of a sale. In April 2017, the Board of Directors determined that based on the information available, we would attain the best long-term value by withdrawing from the sales process and continuing operating the business unit. We will aggressively pursue claims for five Texas Department of Transportation projects that resulted in significant losses recorded in 2016. However, there can be no assurance as to the final amounts collected. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $49.7 million of claims related to the Belton area projects included in contract value.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Needs\nLiquidity represents our ability to pay our liabilities when they become due, fund business operations and meet our contractual obligations and execute our business plan. Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash balances at the beginning of each period and our net cash flow. If needed, we have availability under our lines of credit to augment liquidity needs. In order to maintain sufficient liquidity, we evaluate our working capital requirements on a regular basis. We may elect to raise additional capital by issuing common stock, convertible notes, term debt or increasing our credit facility as necessary to fund our operations or to fund the acquisition of new businesses.\nOur cash and cash equivalents totaled $170.4 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $135.8 million at December 31, 2016. We anticipate that our cash and investments on hand, existing borrowing capacity under our credit facility and our future cash flows from operations will provide sufficient funds to enable us to meet our operating needs, our planned capital expenditures, and settle our commitments and contingencies for at least the next twelve months. In evaluating our liquidity needs, we do not consider cash and cash equivalents held by our consolidated VIEs. These amounts, which totaled $60.3 million and $7.0 million as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, are not available for general corporate purposes.\nThe construction industry is capital intensive, and we expect to continue to make capital expenditures to meet anticipated needs for our services. Historically, we have invested an amount that approximated the sum of depreciation and amortization expenses plus proceeds from equipment sales. In 2017, we spent approximately $79.8 million for capital expenditures, which included $9.9 million spent for our investment in the solar projects. In addition, the companies acquired during the period added $12.4 million to property, plant and equipment. For 2017, the amount of depreciation, amortization and equipment sales was approximately $75.0 million. Capital expenses are expected to total $70.0 to $75.0 million for 2018.\nCash Flows\nCash flows during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are summarized as follows:\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nChange in cash:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n188.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n62.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n48.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(131.4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(59.4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(48.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(22.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(28.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n21.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n34.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(25.3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n21.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nThe sources and uses of cash flow associated with operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating Activities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n76.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n27.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n37.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n66.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n68.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n65.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet deferred taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(7.0)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nChanges in assets and liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n50.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(43.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(46.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(8.4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0.1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n188.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n62.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n48.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 and 2016\nNet cash provided by operating activities for 2017 was $188.9 million , an increase of $126.3 million compared to 2016.

We believe the ownership of equipment is generally preferable to renting equipment on a project-by-project basis, as ownership helps to ensure the equipment is available for our projects when needed. In addition, ownership has historically resulted in lower overall equipment costs.\nWe periodically sell equipment, typically to update our fleet. We received proceeds from the sale of used equipment of $8.7 million, $9.6 million and $9.9 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nDuring 2017, we invested $13.6 million in short-term investments.

The Credit Agreement consists of a $200.0 million revolving credit facility whereby the Lenders agreed to make loans on a revolving basis from time to time and to issue letters of credit for up to the $200.0 million committed amount. The termination date of the Credit Agreement is September 29, 2022.\nThe principal amount of any loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at either: (i) LIBOR plus an applicable margin as specified in the Credit Agreement (based on our senior debt to EBITDA ratio as defined in the Credit Agreement), or (ii) the Base Rate (which is the greater of (a) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50% or (b) the prime rate as announced by the Administrative Agent). Non-use fees, letter of credit fees and administrative agent fees are payable at rates specified in the Credit Agreement.\nThe principal amount of any loan drawn under the Credit Agreement may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time, with a minimum prepayment of $5.0 million.\nThe Credit Agreement includes customary restrictive covenants for facilities of this type, as discussed below.\nCommercial letters of credit outstanding were $19.5 million at December 31, 2017. Other than commercial letters of credit, there were no borrowings under the Credit Agreement or the previous credit agreement during the twelve months ended Decmeber 31, 2017, and available borrowing capacity at December 31, 2017 was $180.5 million.\nSenior Secured Notes and Shelf Agreement\nOn December 28, 2012, we entered into a $50.0 million Senior Secured Notes purchase ( Senior Notes\u201d) and a $25.0 million private shelf agreement (the Notes Agreement\u201d) by and among us, The Prudential Investment Management, Inc. and certain Prudential affiliates (the Noteholders\u201d). On June 3, 2015, the Notes Agreement was amended to provide for the issuance of additional notes of up to $75.0 million over the next three year period ending June 3, 2018 ( Additional Senior Notes\u201d).\nThe Senior Notes amount was funded on December 28, 2012. The Senior Notes are due December 28, 2022 and bear interest at an annual rate of 3.65%, paid quarterly in arrears. Annual principal payments of $7.1 million are required from December 28, 2016 through December 28, 2021 with a final payment due on December 28, 2022. The principal amount may be prepaid, with a minimum prepayment of $5.0 million, at any time, subject to make-whole provisions.\nOn July 25, 2013, we drew $25.0 million available under the Notes Agreement. The notes are due July 25, 2023 and bear interest at an annual rate of 3.85% paid quarterly in arrears. Seven annual principal payments of $3.6 million are required from July 25, 2017 with a final payment due on July 25, 2023.\nOn November 9, 2015, we drew $25.0 million available under the Additional Senior Notes Agreement. The notes are due November 9, 2025 and bear interest at an annual rate of 4.6% paid quarterly in arrears. Seven annual principal payments of $3.6 million are required from November 9, 2019 with a final payment due on November 9, 2025.\nLoans made under both the Credit Agreement and the Notes Agreement are secured by our assets, including, among others, our cash, inventory, equipment (excluding equipment subject to permitted liens), and accounts receivable. All of our domestic subsidiaries have issued joint and several guaranties in favor of the Lenders and Noteholders for all amounts under the Credit Agreement and Notes Agreement.\nBoth the Credit Agreement and the Notes Agreement contain various restrictive and financial covenants including, among others, senior debt/EBITDA ratio and debt service coverage requirements. In addition, the agreements include restrictions on investments, change of control provisions and provisions in the event we dispose more than 20% of our total assets.\nWe were in compliance with the covenants for the Credit Agreement and the Notes Agreement at December 31, 2017.\nCanadian Credit Facility\nWe have a demand credit facility for $8.0 million in Canadian dollars with a Canadian bank for purposes of issuing commercial letters of credit in Canada. The credit facility has an annual renewal and provides for the issuance of commercial letters of credit for a term of up to five years. The facility provides for an annual fee of 1% for any issued and outstanding commercial letters of credit. Letters of credit can be denominated in either Canadian or U.S. dollars. At December 31, 2017, letters of credit outstanding totaled $0.5 million in Canadian dollars. At December 31, 2017, the available borrowing capacity was $7.5 million in Canadian dollars. The credit facility contains a working capital restrictive covenant for our Canadian subsidiary, OnQuest Canada, ULC. At December 31, 2017, OnQuest Canada, ULC was in compliance with the covenant.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $259.2 million of outstanding long-term debt and capital lease obligations, and there were no short-term borrowings.\nA summary of contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 was as follows:\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAfter 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(In Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt and capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n259.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n65.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n113.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n58.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n22.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest on long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n24.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPension plan withdrawal liability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEquipment operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n31.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContingent consideration obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReal property leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n333.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n96.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n143.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n66.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n26.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLetters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n19.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n19.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)The interest amount represents interest payments for our fixed rate debt assuming that principal payments are made as originally scheduled.\nThe table does not include potential obligations under multi-employer pension plans in which some of our employees participate. Our multi-employer pension plan contribution rates are generally specified in our collective bargaining agreements, and contributions are made to the plans based on employee payrolls. Our obligations for future periods cannot be determined because we cannot predict the number of employees that we will employ at any given time nor the plans in which they may participate.\nWe may also be required to make additional contributions to multi-employer pension plans if they become underfunded, and these contributions will be determined based on our union payroll. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 added special funding and operational rules for multi-employer plans that are classified as endangered,\u201d seriously endangered\u201d or critical\u201d status. Plans in these classifications must adopt measures to improve their funded status through a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, which may require additional contributions from employers. The amounts of additional funds that we may be obligated to contribute cannot be reasonably estimated and is not included in the table above.\nIn November 2011, members of the Pipe Line Contractors Association ( PLCA\u201d) including ARB, Rockford and Q3C (prior to the acquisition in 2012), withdrew from the Central States Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund multiemployer pension plan ( Plan\u201d). These withdrawals were made in order to mitigate additional liability in connection with the significantly underfunded Plan. We recorded a withdrawal liability of $7.5 million, which was increased to $7.6 million after the acquisition of Q3C. During the first quarter of 2016, we received a final payment schedule. As a result of payments made and based on this schedule, the liability recorded at December 31, 2017 was $4.7 million. We expect to pay the remaining liability balance during 2018 and have no plans to withdraw from any other agreements.\nWe have also excluded from the table any interest and fees associated with letters of credit and commitment fees under our credit facility since these amounts are unknown and variable.\nRelated Party Transactions\nPrior to March 2017, Primoris leased three properties in California from Stockdale Investment Group, Inc. ( SIGI\u201d). Our Chairman of the Board of Directors, who is our largest stockholder, and his family hold a majority interest of SIGI. In March 2017, we exercised a right of first refusal and purchased the SIGI properties. The purchase was approved by our Board of Directors for $12.8 million. We assumed three mortgage notes totaling $4.2 million with the remainder paid in cash. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we paid $0.2 million, $0.8 million, and $0.8 million, respectively, in lease payments to SIGI for the use of these properties.\nPrimoris leases properties from other individuals that were past sellers of acquisitions or are current employees. The amounts leased are not material and each arrangement was approved by the Board of Directors.\nOff Balance Sheet Transactions\nAs is common in our industry, we enter into certain off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business that result in risks not directly reflected on our balance sheet. We have no off-balance sheet financing arrangement with variable interest entities. The following represents transactions, obligations or relationships that could be considered material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nTable 117: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAt December 31, 2017, we had letters of credit outstanding of $19.8 million under the terms of our credit agreements.

In addition, from time to time, certain customers require us to post a letter of credit to ensure payments to our subcontractors or guarantee performance under our contracts. Letters of credit reduce our borrowing availability under our Credit Agreement and Canadian Credit Facility. If these letters of credit were drawn on by the beneficiary, we would be required to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit, and we may be required to record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement. We do not believe that it is likely that any material claims will be made under a letter of credit.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWe enter into non-cancellable operating leases for some of our facilities, equipment and vehicles, including leases with related parties.

In most instances, these agreements require that we contribute to multi-employer pension and health and welfare plans. For many plans, the contributions are determined annually and required future contributions cannot be determined since contribution rates depend on the total number of union employees and actuarial calculations based on the demographics of all participants. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended by the Multi-Employer Pension Amendments Act of 1980, subject employers to potential liabilities in the event of an employer's complete or partial withdrawal of an underfunded multi-employer pension plan. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 added new funding rules that are classified as endangered\u201d, seriously endangered\u201d, or critical\u201d status. As discussed in Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we have recognized a withdrawal liability for one plan. We currently do not anticipate withdrawal from any other multi-employer pension plans.

We have been engaged in dispute resolution to collect money we believe we are owed for two construction projects completed in 2014. Because of uncertainties associated with the projects, including uncertainty of the amounts that would be collected, we used a zero profit margin approach to recording revenues during the construction period for both projects.\nFor the first project, a cost reimbursable contract, we have recorded a receivable of $32.9 million with a reserve of approximately $17.9 million included in Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings.\u201d At this time, we cannot predict the amount that we will collect nor the timing of any collection. The dispute resolution for the receivable initially required international arbitration; however, in the first half of 2016, the owner sought bankruptcy protection in U.S. bankruptcy court. We have initiated litigation against the sureties who have provided lien and stop payment release bonds for the total amount owed. A trial date has been tentatively set for the second quarter of 2018.\nFor the second project, we had recorded a receivable of $17.9 million. During the third quarter 2016, we settled the dispute with an exchange of general releases and receipt of $38.0 million in cash. We changed our zero estimate of profit and accounted for the settlement as a change in accounting estimate which resulted in recognizing revenues of approximately $27.5 million and gross profit of approximately $26.7 million in the third quarter of 2016.\n2018 Outlook\nWe believe that our end markets will continue their growth in 2018. Our backlog at December 31, 2017 was $2.6 billion. We anticipate potential changes to the previously stringent regulatory and environmental requirements for many of our clients' infrastructure projects, which may improve the timing and certainty of the projects. While fluctuating oil prices create uncertainty as to the timing of some of our opportunities, we are beginning to see preliminary bidding activity for larger gas, oil and derivatives projects. We believe that Primoris has the financial and operational strength to meet either short-term delays or the impact of significant increases in work. We continue to be optimistic about both short and longer-term opportunities. Our view of the outlook for our major end markets currently is as follows:\nTable 123: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nConstruction of petroleum, natural gas, and natural gas liquid pipelines - While we have recently seen signs of a recovery in the price of oil, we expect that activities in most if not all of the shale basins will remain at reduced levels until a higher oil price is sustained, reducing any upstream work such as gathering lines and petroleum transport pipelines for the near future. If production from the shale formations continues to increase in the near future, the current disconnect between production and processing locations would provide opportunities for our Pipeline segment. We expect that the efforts by gas utilities to move shale gas from the Marcellus region to Florida and other Atlantic states could continue to provide significant opportunity over the next 2-3 years.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nInspection, maintenance and replacement of gas utility infrastructure -We expect that ongoing safety enhancements to the gas utility infrastructure will provide continuing opportunities for our Utilities segment, especially in California, as well as in the Midwest.

We believe that based on continuing population growth, the intermittency of renewable power resources and the environmental requirements limiting using ocean water for cooling, power plants will be needed in spite of vocal opposition to non-green\u201d sources. In addition, the current low price of natural gas could result in the conversion of coal-fired power plants and conversion and expansion at chemical plants and industrial facilities in other parts of the United States. These opportunities would benefit our Power segment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nConstruction of alternative energy facilities, wind farms, solar energy - We anticipate continued construction opportunities as state governments remain committed to renewable power standards, primarily benefitting our Power segment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTransportation infrastructure construction opportunities - We believe that passing of longer term highway funding by the federal government in 2015, results of the 2016 federal election, and voter approval of highway funding proposition 7 in Texas will provide increased opportunity for our heavy civil and highway groups especially in Texas.

This 2018 Outlook\u201d consists\nof forward-looking statements and should be read in conjunction with the cautions about forward looking statements found at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBacklog\nFor companies in the construction industry, backlog can be an indicator of future revenue streams. Different companies define and calculate backlog in different manners. We define backlog as a combination of: (1) anticipated revenue from the uncompleted portions of existing contracts for which we have known revenue amounts for fixed-price and unit-price contracts ( Fixed Backlog\u201d), and (2) the estimated revenues on MSA work for the next four quarters ( MSA Backlog\u201d). We normally do not include time-and-equipment, time-and-materials and cost reimbursable plus fee contracts in the calculation of backlog, since their final revenue amount is difficult to estimate in advance. However, we will include these types of contracts in backlog if the customer specifies an anticipated revenue amount.\nThe two components of backlog, Fixed Backlog and MSA Backlog, are detailed below.\nFixed Backlog\nFixed Backlog by reporting segment and the changes in Fixed Backlog for the periods ending December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows, (in millions):\nTable 129: <table>

The backlog estimates include amounts from estimated MSA revenues, but our customers are not contractually obligated to purchase an amount of services from us under the MSAs. Any of our contracts, MSA, fixed-price or unit-price, may be terminated by our customers on relatively short notice. In the event of a project cancellation, we may be reimbursed for certain costs, but typically we have no contractual right to the total revenues reflected in backlog. Projects may remain in backlog for extended periods of time as a result of customer delays, regulatory requirements or project specific issues. Future revenues from projects completed under time-and-equipment, time-and-materials and cost-reimbursable-plus-fee contracts may not be included in our estimated backlog amount.\nEffects of Inflation and Changing Prices\nOur operations are affected by increases in prices, whether caused by inflation or other economic factors. We attempt to recover anticipated increases in the cost of labor, equipment, fuel and materials through price escalation provisions in certain major contracts or by considering the estimated effect of such increases when bidding or pricing new work or by entering into back-to-back contracts with suppliers and subcontractors.", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I am unable to complete your request because I am unable to identify the specific cells in the table you'd like to copy.\n- Would you be able to clarify which cells you'd like to copy?

OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes to those statements included as item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion includes forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties and unknown or changed circumstances. For a further discussion, please see Forward Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those risks inherent with our business as discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d.\nThe following discussion starts with an overview of our business and a discussion of trends, including seasonality, that affect our industry. That is followed by an overview of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. Next we discuss our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources, including our off-balance sheet transactions and contractual obligations. We conclude with a discussion of our outlook and backlog.\nIntroduction\nPrimoris is a holding company of various subsidiaries, which form one of the larger publicly traded specialty contractors and infrastructure companies in the United States. Serving diverse end-markets, we provide a wide range of construction, fabrication, maintenance, replacement, water and wastewater, and engineering services to major public utilities, petrochemical companies, energy companies, municipalities, state departments of transportation and other customers. We install, replace, repair and rehabilitate natural gas, refined product, water and wastewater pipeline systems; large diameter gas and liquid pipeline facilities; and heavy civil projects, earthwork and site development. We also construct mechanical facilities and other structures, including power plants, petrochemical facilities, refineries, water and wastewater treatment facilities and parking structures. Finally, we provide specialized process and product engineering services.\nWe have longstanding customer relationships with major utility, refining, petrochemical, power and engineering companies. We have completed major underground and industrial projects for a number of large natural gas transmission and petrochemical companies in the United States, as well as significant projects for our engineering customers. We enter into a large number of contracts each year, and the projects can vary in length from several weeks to as long as 60 months, or longer for completion on larger projects. Although we have not been dependent upon any one customer in any year, a small number of customers tend to constitute a substantial portion of our total revenues.\nThrough the end of the year 2016, we segregated our business into three reportable segments: the Energy segment, the East Construction Services segment and the West Construction Services segment. In the first quarter 2017, we changed our reportable segments in connection with a realignment of our internal organization and management structure. The segment changes reflect the focus of our chief operating decision maker ( CODM\u201d) on the range of services we provide to our end user markets. Our CODM regularly reviews our operating and financial performance based on these segments.\nThe current reportable segments include the Power, Industrial, and Engineering segment, the Pipeline and Underground segment, the Utilities and Distribution segment, and the Civil segment. See Note 14 - Reportable Segments\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a brief description of the reportable segments and their operations.\nThe classification of revenues and gross profit for segment reporting purposes can at times require judgment on the part of management. Our segments may perform services across industries or perform joint services for customers in\nmultiple industries. To determine reportable segment gross profit, certain allocations, including allocations of shared and indirect costs, such as facility costs, equipment costs and indirect operating expenses were made.\nThe following table lists our primary business units and their reportable segment:\n\nWe own a 50% interest in two separate joint ventures, both formed in 2015. The Carlsbad Power Constructors joint venture ( Carlsbad\u201d) is engineering and constructing a gas-fired power generation facility, and the ARB Inc. & B&M Engineering Co.\u201d joint venture ( Wilmington\u201d) is also engineering and constructing a gas-fired power generation facility. Both projects are located in Southern California. The joint venture operations are included as part of the Power segment. As a result of determining that we are the primary beneficiary of the two variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d), the results of the Carlsbad and Wilmington joint ventures are consolidated in our financial statements. Both projects are expected to be completed in 2018.\nWe owned 50% of the Blythe Power Constructors joint venture ( Blythe\u201d) created for the installation of a parabolic trough solar field and steam generation system in California, and its operations have been included as part of the Power segment. We determined that in accordance with FASB Topic 810, we were the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and have consolidated the results of Blythe in our financial statements. The project has been completed, the project warranty expired in May 2015, and dissolution of the joint venture was completed in the third quarter of 2015.\nFinancial information for the joint ventures is presented in Note 12- Noncontrolling Interests\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nWe continue to be acquisitive, and the following outlines the various acquisitions made over the past three years. See Note 4- Business Combinations\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K\nOn February 28, 2015, we acquired the net assets of Aevenia, Inc. for $22.3 million. Aevenia operations are included in the Utilities segment.\nOn January 29, 2016, we acquired the net assets of Mueller Concrete Construction Company (\"Mueller\") for $4.1 million, and on November 18, 2016, we acquired the net assets of Northern Energy & Power ( Northern\u201d) for $6.9 million. On June 24, 2016, we purchased property, plant and equipment from Pipe Jacking Unlimited, Inc. ( Pipe Jacking\u201d), consisting of specialty directional drilling and tunneling equipment for $13.4 million. We determined this purchase did not meet the definition of a business as defined under ASC 805. Mueller operations are included in the Utilities segment, Northern operations are included in the Power segment, and Pipe Jacking operations are included in the Pipeline segment.\nOn May 26, 2017, we acquired the net assets of Florida Gas Contractors ( FGC\u201d) for $37.7 million; on May 30, 2017, we acquired certain engineering assets for approximately $2.3 million; and on June 16, 2017, we acquired the net assets of Coastal Field Services ( Coastal\u201d) for $27.5 million. FGC operations are included in the Utilities segment, the engineering assets are included in the Power segment, and Coastal operations are included in the Pipeline segment.\nIn August 2017, we announced we are investing approximately $22.0 million to build, own, and operate a portfolio of solar projects in a California School District acquired from the developers, Spear Point Energy, LLC, and PFMG Solar, LLC. This investment amount includes the estimated cost of Engineering, Procurement, and Construction ( EPC\u201d) work on the projects, which is projected to be completed in 2018. The solar projects are expected to generate a 25-year recurring revenue stream from the District's signed power purchase agreement. As an investment in a renewable energy project, the solar assets should provide us with investment tax credits valued at over $5.0 million. As of December 31, 2017, our investment for the solar projects was approximately $9.9 million. The $9.9 million investment is our construction in progress on the solar projects and is included in Property and equipment, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nMaterial trends and uncertainties\nWe generate our revenue from both large and small construction and engineering projects. The award of these contracts is dependent on many factors, most of which are not within our control. We depend in part on spending by companies in the energy and oil and gas industries, the gas utility industry, as well as municipal water and wastewater customers. Over the past several years, each segment has benefited from demand for more efficient and more environmentally friendly energy and power facilities, local highway and bridge needs and from the activity level in the oil and gas industry. However, periodically, each of these industries and government agencies is adversely affected by macroeconomic conditions. Economic factors outside of our control may affect the amount and size of contracts we are awarded in any particular period.\nWe closely monitor our customers to assess the effect that changes in economic, market and regulatory conditions may have on them. We have experienced reduced spending by some of our customers over the last several years, which we attribute to negative economic and market conditions, and we anticipate that these negative conditions may continue to affect demand for our services in the near-term. Fluctuations in market prices of oil, gas and other fuel sources have affected demand for our services. While we have seen signs of a recovery in the price of oil, the significant volatility in the price of oil, gas and liquid natural gas that occurred in the past few years has created uncertainty with respect to demand for our oil and gas pipeline services both in the near-term and for future projects. We believe that our upstream operations, such as the construction of gathering lines within the oil shale formations, will remain at lower levels for an extended period. While there was some stability in the price of oil in 2017, that stability has not resulted in a significant change in the contracting activities of our customers. We believe that over time, the need for pipeline infrastructure for mid-stream and gas utility companies will result in a continuing need for our services, but the impact of the low oil prices may delay midstream pipeline opportunities. The continuing changes in the regulatory environment also affect the demand for our services, either by increasing our work or delaying projects. For example, the regulatory environment in California may result in delays for the construction of gas-fired power plants while regulators continue to search for significant renewable resources, but renewable resources may also create a demand for our construction services such as the need for storage of renewable generated electricity. Finally, we believe that regulated utility customers will continue to invest in our maintenance and replacement services.\nSeasonality, cyclicality and variability\nOur results of operations are subject to quarterly variations. Some of the variation is the result of weather, particularly rain, ice and snow, which can impact our ability to perform construction services. While the majority of our work is in the southern half of the United States, these seasonal impacts can affect revenues and profitability in all of our businesses since gas and other utilities defer routine replacement and repair during their period of peak demand. Any quarter can be affected either negatively or positively by atypical weather patterns in any part of the country. In addition, demand for new projects tends to be lower during the early part of the year due to clients' internal budget cycles. As a result, we usually experience higher revenues and earnings in the third and fourth quarters of the year as compared to the first two quarters.\nWe are also dependent on large construction projects which tend not to be seasonal, but can fluctuate from year to year based on general economic conditions. Our business may be affected by declines or delays in new projects or by client project schedules. Because of the cyclical nature of our business, the financial results for any period may fluctuate from prior periods, and our financial condition and operating results may vary from quarter to quarter. Results from one quarter may not be indicative of financial condition or operating results for any other quarter or for an entire year.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGeneral-The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and also affect the amounts of revenues and expenses reported for each period. These estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available, is dependent on future events, or is not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. Often, estimates are particularly difficult to determine, and we must exercise significant judgment. Estimates may be used in our assessments of revenue recognition under percentage-of-completion accounting, the allowance for doubtful accounts, useful lives of property and equipment, fair value assumptions in analyzing goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, self-insured claims liabilities and deferred income taxes. Actual results could differ from those that result from using the estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nThe following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Management's estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. We periodically review these accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nRevenue recognition-We generate revenue under a range of contracting options, including fixed-price, unit-price, time and material, and cost reimbursable plus fee contracts. A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from contracts that are fixed-price or unit-price, using the percentage-of-completion method. For time and material and cost reimbursable plus fee contracts, revenue is recognized primarily based on contractual terms. Generally, time and material and cost reimbursable contract revenues are recognized on an input basis, based on labor hours incurred and on purchases made.\nIn the percentage-of-completion method, estimated contract values, estimated cost at completion and total costs incurred to date are used to calculate revenues earned. Unforeseen events and circumstances can alter the estimate of the costs and potential profit associated with a particular contract. Total estimated costs, and thus contract revenues and income, can be impacted by changes in productivity, scheduling, the unit cost of labor, subcontracts, materials and equipment. Additionally, external factors such as weather, client needs, client delays in providing permits and approvals,\nlabor availability, governmental regulation and politics may affect the progress of a project's completion and thus the timing of revenue recognition.\nTo the extent that original cost estimates are modified, estimated costs to complete increase, delivery schedules are delayed, or progress under a contract is otherwise impeded, cash flow, revenue recognition and profitability from a particular contract may be adversely affected. As a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts, we review and update our contract-related estimates regularly. We recognize adjustments in estimated profit on contracts as changes in accounting estimates in the period in which the revisions are identified. Revenue and profit in future periods of contract performance are recognized using the adjusted estimate.\nIf at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on a contract, the projected loss is recognized in full in the period it is identified and recognized as an accrued loss provision\u201d which is included in the accrued expenses and other current liabilities amount on the balance sheet. For contract revenue recognized under the percentage-of-completion method, the accrued loss provision is adjusted so that the gross profit for the contract remains zero in future periods. The provision for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts was $10.1 million and $12.8 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nWe consider unapproved change orders to be contract variations for which customers have not agreed to both scope and price. Costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in the estimated cost to complete and are treated as project costs as incurred. We will recognize a change in contract value if we believe it is probable that the contract price will be adjusted and can be reliably estimated. Unapproved change orders involve the use of estimates, and it is reasonably possible that revisions to the estimated costs and recoverable amounts may be required in future reporting periods to reflect changes in estimates or final agreements with customers.\nWe consider claims to be amounts we seek, or will seek, to collect from customers or others for customer-caused changes in contract specifications or design, or other customer-related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs on which there is no agreement with customers. Claims can also be caused by non-customer-caused changes, such as rain or other weather delays. Costs associated with claims are included in the estimated costs to complete the contracts and are treated as project costs when incurred. Claims are included in revenue to the extent we have a reasonable legal basis, the related costs have been incurred, realization is probable, and amounts can be reliably estimated. Revenue in excess of contract costs from claims is recognized after an agreement is reached with customers as to the value of the claims, which in some instances may not occur until after completion of work under the contract.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had unapproved change orders and claims included in the expected contract value that totaled approximately $67.8 million. These claims were in the process of being negotiated in the normal course of business. Approximately $56.7 million of unapproved change orders and claims had been recognized as revenue on a cumulative percentage-of-completion basis through December 31, 2017.\nIn all forms of contracts, we estimate the collectability of contract amounts at the same time that we estimate project costs. If we anticipate that there may be issues associated with the collectability of the full amount calculated as revenues, we may reduce the amount recognized as revenue to reflect the uncertainty associated with realization of the eventual cash collection. For example, when a cost reimbursable project exceeds the client's expected budget amount, the client frequently requests an adjustment to the final amount. Similarly, some utility clients reserve the right to audit costs for significant periods after performance of the work. In these situations, we may choose to defer recognition of a portion of the revenue until the client pays for the services.\nThe caption Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings\u201d in the Consolidated Balance Sheets represents unbilled receivables which arise when revenues have been recorded but the amount will not be billed until a later date. Balances represent: (a) unbilled amounts arising from the use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting which may not be billed under the terms of the contract until a later date or project milestone; (b) incurred costs to be billed under cost reimbursable type contracts, including amounts arising from routine lags in billing; or (c) the revenue associated with unapproved change orders or claims when realization is probable and amounts can be reliably estimated. For those contracts in which billings exceed contract revenues recognized to date, the excess amounts are included in the caption Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings\u201d.\nIn accordance with applicable terms of certain construction contracts, retainage amounts may be withheld by customers until completion and acceptance of the project. Some payments of the retainage may not be received for a significant period after completion of our portion of a project. In some jurisdictions, retainage amounts are deposited into an escrow account.\nValuation of acquired businesses-We use the fair value of the consideration paid and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to account for the purchase price of businesses. The determination of fair value requires estimates and judgments of future cash flow expectations for the assignment of the fair values to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets.\nIdentifiable Tangible Assets. Significant identifiable tangible assets acquired would include accounts receivable, costs and earnings in excess of billings for projects, inventory and fixed assets (generally consisting of construction equipment) for each acquisition. We determine the fair value of these assets as of the acquisition date. For current assets and current liabilities of an acquisition, we will evaluate whether the book value is equivalent to fair value due to their short term nature. We estimate the fair value of fixed assets using a market approach, based on comparable market values for similar equipment of similar condition and age.\nIdentifiable Intangible Assets. When necessary, we use the assistance of an independent third party valuation specialist to determine the fair value of the intangible assets acquired in the acquisitions.\nA liability for contingent consideration based on future earnings is estimated at its fair value at the date of acquisition, with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in earnings as a gain or loss. Fair value is estimated as of the acquisition date using estimated earnout payments based on management's best estimate.\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States provide a measurement period\u201d of up to one year in which to finalize all fair value estimates associated with the acquisition of a business. Most estimates are preliminary until the end of the measurement period. During the measurement period, adjustments to initial valuations and estimates that reflect newly discovered information that existed at the acquisition date are recorded. After the measurement date, any adjustments would be recorded as a current period gain or loss.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived intangible Assets-Goodwill and certain intangible assets acquired in a business combination and determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are assessed for impairment annually and more frequently if triggering events occur. In performing these assessments, management relies on various factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable transactions and other market data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill for impairment. Since judgment is involved in performing fair value measurements used in goodwill impairment analyses, there is risk that the carrying values of our goodwill may not be properly stated.\nWe account for goodwill, including evaluation of any goodwill impairment under ASC 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other\u201d, performed at the reporting unit level for those units with recorded goodwill as of October 1 of each year, unless there are indications requiring a more frequent impairment test.\nGoodwill has arisen from acquisitions and is recorded at our segments as follows at December 31 (in thousands):\n\nUnder ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other\u201d, we can assess qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative impairment test of intangible assets is necessary. Typically, however, we use the two-step impairment test outlined in ASC 350. First, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. Fair value for the goodwill impairment test is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on our financial plan discounted using our weighted average cost of capital and market indicators of terminal year cash flows. Other valuation methods may be used to corroborate the discounted cash flow method. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit is in excess of its fair value, goodwill is considered potentially impaired and further tests are performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. In the second step of the goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination was determined. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill.\nDuring the third quarter of 2016, we made a decision to divest the Texas heavy civil business unit, a division of Primoris Heavy Civil within the Civil segment. We engaged a financial advisor to assist in the marketing and sale of the business unit, and planned to continue operating the business unit until completion of a sale. In April 2017, the Board of Directors determined that based on the information available, we would attain the best long-term value by withdrawing from the sales process and continuing to operate the business unit.\nUnder the provisions of ASC 350, the planned divestiture triggered an analysis of the goodwill amount of Primoris Heavy Civil. The analysis resulted in a pretax, non-cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately $2.7 million in the third quarter of 2016.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, an impairment expense of $0.4 million was recorded relating to the goodwill attributed to Cardinal Contractors, Inc., which is a part of the Power segment. There were no other impairments of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nDisruptions to our business, such as end market conditions, protracted economic weakness, unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units and the divestiture of a significant component of a reporting unit, may result in our having to perform a goodwill impairment first step valuation analysis for some or all of our reporting units prior to the required annual assessment. These types of events and the resulting analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in any periods in the future.\nReserve for uninsured risks-Estimates are inherent in the assessment of our exposure to uninsured risks. Significant judgments by us and, where possible, third-party experts are needed in determining probable and/or reasonably estimable amounts that should be recorded or disclosed in the financial statements. Semiannually, we obtain a third-party actuarial valuation for some of our uninsured risks. The results of any changes in accounting estimates are reflected in the financial statements of the period in which we determine we need to record a change.\nWe self-insure worker's compensation claims up to $0.25 million per claim. We maintained a self-insurance reserve totaling approximately $18.5 million at December 31, 2017 and approximately $18.8 million at December 31, 2016. Claims administration expenses were charged to current operations as incurred. Our accruals are based on judgment, the probability of losses, and where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and third party consultants. The amount is included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities\u201d on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Actual payments that may be made in the future could materially differ from such reserves.\nIncome taxes-We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method as set forth in ASC 740, Income Taxes\u201d, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and tax bases of\nassets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of changes in tax rates on net deferred tax assets or liabilities is recognized as an increase or decrease in net income in the period the tax change is enacted.\nDeferred tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance if, in the judgment of our management, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available evidence, including recent financial operations, projected future taxable income, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies, and the length of tax asset carryforward periods. The realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable earnings in certain jurisdictions. If we subsequently determine that some or all deferred tax assets that were previously offset by a valuation allowance are realizable, the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased by reducing the valuation allowance, thereby increasing income in the period when that determination is made. During 2017, we determined it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax asset for foreign tax credits will not be realized. Accordingly, a valuation allowance of $0.6 million was recorded.\nA tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained based on its technical merits in a tax examination, using the presumption that the tax authority has full knowledge of all relevant facts regarding the position. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on ultimate settlement with the tax authority. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test, no tax benefit is recorded.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act-On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that affect our 2017 results, including the allowance of bonus depreciation that provides for immediate deduction of qualified property placed in service after September 27, 2017. The Tax Act also establishes new tax laws that may affect our 2018 and future results, including but not limited to:\n \u00b7 Reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%; \n \u00b7 The repeal of the domestic production activities deduction; \n \u00b7 Further limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation; \n \u00b7 Disallowance of certain entertainment expense deductions; \n \u00b7 Limitations on the use of foreign tax credits to reduce the U.S. income tax liability; \n \u00b7 Limitations on interest expense deductibility; \n \u00b7 Elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax. \nWhile the Tax Act also contains complex changes to the tax code for companies operating internationally, we are not materially impacted by the international provisions of the Tax Act.\nGiven the significant impact of the legislation, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB\u201d) 118 which provides guidance on accounting for uncertainties of the effects of the Tax Act. Specifically, SAB 118 allows companies to record provisional estimates of the impact of the Tax Act during a one year measurement period\u201d similar to that used when accounting for business combinations.\nAs a result of the Tax Act, we remeasured our deferred tax assets and liabilities using the newly enacted tax rates and recorded a one-time net tax benefit of $9.4 million in the period ended December 31, 2017. This tax benefit is a provisional estimate that could be revised once we finalize our deductions for tax depreciation and executive compensation accruals. We may also revise our estimate based on any additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, and other standard-setting bodies.\nLong-Lived Assets-Assets held and used by us, primarily property, plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable. We perform an undiscounted operation cash flow analysis to determine if an impairment exists. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identified. If an impairment is determined to exist, any related\nimpairment loss is calculated based on fair value. The calculation of the fair value of long-lived assets is based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of long-lived assets, the future carrying value of our long-lived assets may have differing future fair values.\nMultiemployer plans - Various subsidiaries are signatories to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements require that we participate in and contribute to a number of multiemployer benefit plans for our union employees at rates determined by the agreements. The trustees for each multiemployer plan determine the eligibility and allocations of contributions and benefit amounts, determine the types of benefits, and administer the plan. To the extent that any plans are underfunded, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, requires that if we were to withdraw from an agreement or if a plan is terminated, we may incur a withdrawal obligation. Since the withdrawal liability is based on estimates of our proportional share of the plan's unfunded vested liability, as calculated by the plan's actuaries, the potential withdrawal obligation may be significant.\nIn November 2011, members of the Pipe Line Contractors Association PLCA\u201d including ARB, Rockford and Q3C (prior to our acquisition in 2012), withdrew from the Central States Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund multiemployer pension plan ( Plan\u201d). These withdrawals were made in order to mitigate additional liability in connection with the significantly underfunded Plan. We recorded a withdrawal liability of $7.5 million, which was increased to $7.6 million after the acquisition of Q3C. During the first quarter of 2016, we received a final payment schedule. As a result of payments made and based on this schedule, the liability recorded at December 31, 2017 was $4.7 million. We expect to pay the remaining liability balance during 2018 and have no plans to withdraw from any other labor agreements.\nLitigation and contingencies-Litigation and contingencies are included in our consolidated financial statements based on our assessment of the expected outcome of litigation proceedings or the expected resolution of the contingency. We provide for costs related to contingencies when a loss from such claims is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. In determining whether it is possible to provide an estimate of loss, or range of possible loss, we review and evaluate litigation and regulatory matters on a quarterly basis in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. If we determine an unfavorable outcome is not probable or reasonably estimable, we do not accrue for a potential litigation loss. Management is unable to ascertain the ultimate outcome of other claims and legal proceedings; however, after review and consultation with counsel and taking into consideration relevant insurance coverage and related deductibles/self-insurance retention, management believes that it has meritorious defense to the claims and believes that the reasonably possible outcome of such claims will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. See Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Results\nTwo events had a material impact on our results of operations in 2016. In the third quarter we received a $38.0 million settlement for one of the construction projects that we had identified as part of our Receivable Collection Actions\u201d, discussed below. Because we had recorded the project with zero gross profit, the settlement added $27.5 million to revenues and $26.7 million to gross profit. Also in the third quarter, we recorded a charge of $37.3 million primarily related to certain Belton, Texas area projects for the Texas Department of Transportation ( TXDOT\u201d), as a result of project delays and productivity issues.\nRevenues\n2017 and 2016\nRevenues for year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $383.0 million, or 19.2%, compared to 2016. All segments reported year over year growth. Progress on three major pipeline jobs ($83.6 million), higher activity with major utility clients in California and the Midwest ($135.6 million) and progress on our joint venture power plant projects in Southern California and a Mid-Atlantic power plant project ($158.2 million combined) drove higher 2017 revenue. Also contributing to 2017 growth was higher volume on our Belton area (Civil) projects and a Louisiana methanol plant project. The overall increase was partially offset by decreases associated with projects substantially completed in 2017 and revenue recognized from the one-time benefit of the settlement of one of the Receivable Collection Actions\u201d in 2016. Revenue from 2017 acquisitions and incremental revenue from 2016 acquisitions (where we only owned a business for a portion of the year) totaled $53.6 million.\n2016 and 2015\nRevenues for year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $67.5 million, or 3.5% compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $64.1 million from Rockford's pipeline work, $34.5 million for work at a large petrochemical project in Louisiana and $35.4 million from a new collaboration MSA arrangement at ARB Underground. These increases were partially offset by a revenue reduction of $50.1 million at OnQuest, a reduction of $16.4 million at Saxon, and a reduction of $24.5 million in Heavy Civil projects. Revenues for 2016 also included the one-time benefit of $27.5 million from the settlement of one of the Receivable Collection Actions\u201d.\nAs discussed in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d, we had unapproved change orders and claims included in contract value that totaled approximately $67.8 million at December 31, 2017. Of this amount, approximately $49.7 million was claims related to the Belton area projects.\nGross Profit\n2017 and 2016\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, gross profit increased by $77.1 million, or 38.3%, compared to 2016. All segments reported year over year improvement. Strong revenue growth and the favorable performance on the two large pipeline projects in Florida drove significant improvement. Also benefiting 2017 were higher volumes for the Power segment and better performance from Civil. The year over year increase was partially offset by $26.7 million of gross profit recognized in 2016 from the settlement of one of the Receivable Collection Actions\u201d. Gross Profit from 2017 acquisitions and incremental gross profit from 2016 acquisitions (where we only owned a business for a portion of the year) totaled $8.6 million. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 11.7% in 2017 from 10.1% in 2016 for the reasons noted above.\n2016 and 2015\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, gross profit decreased by $18.6 million, or 8.4% compared to 2015. The decrease was primarily from the decrease in Heavy Civil projects of $38.2 million, of which $33.4 million was from a decrease at the Belton area projects. Gross profit decreased by $6.1 million at the Louisiana petrochemical project, in spite of an increase in revenue, as the scope of our work has changed to less equipment intensive, lower margin work. Gross profit also decreased at ARB Underground by $6.3 million and $8.6 million at ARB Industrial with these decreases offset by a gross profit increase of $15.4 million at Rockford. Our gross profit benefitted by $26.7 million from the settlement of one of the Receivable Collection Actions\u201d. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased from 11.4% in 2015 to 10.1% in 2016 for the reasons noted above.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A\u201d) consist primarily of compensation and benefits to executive, management level and administrative employees, marketing and communications, professional fees, office rent and utilities and acquisition costs.\n2017 and 2016\nFor 2017, SG&A expenses were $172.1 million, compared to $140.8 million for 2016, an increase of $31.3 million. Approximately $12.4 million of the increase in SG&A is related to businesses acquired in 2017 and a full year of expense in 2017 for the Northern acquisition compared to less than two months of expense in 2016. The remaining increase was primarily due to a $12.6 million increase in compensation related expenses, including incentive compensation accruals; and a $1.3 million increase in legal costs.\nSG&A as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased slightly to 7.2% compared to 7.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, SG&A as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, decreased slightly to 6.9% compared to 7.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n2016 and 2015\nFor 2016, SG&A expenses were $140.8 million, compared to $151.7 million for 2015, a decrease of $10.9 million. The decrease was primarily as a result of decreases in professional fees of $7.4 million due to reduced legal fees and due to completion of the implementation of the integrated financial system. The reduction in SG&A was also the result of a $2.6 million prior year one-time valuation adjustment for the value of a long-term asset. Additionally, SG&A was reduced as a result of a decrease of $1.8 million in compensation and staffing levels.\nSG&A as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased to 7.1% compared to 7.9% for the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of the decreased expenses while revenues increased.\nOther income and expense\nNon-operating income and expense items for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\n\nInvestment income for the year ended December 31, 2017 is related to a gain from a short-term investment in marketable equity securities.We purchased the securities in the third quarter of 2017 and sold the securities in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nForeign exchange gains and losses reflect currency exchange fluctuations of the United States dollar compared to the Canadian dollar. Many of our contracts in Calgary, Canada are sold based on United States dollars, but a portion of the work is paid for with Canadian dollars creating a currency exchange difference.\nOther income for 2017 was $0.5 million compared to other expense of $0.3 million for 2016. The $0.8 million change was primarily due to remeasurement of the contingent consideration related to the FGC performance target contemplated in their purchase agreement. Under ASC 805, we are required to estimate the fair value of contingent consideration based on facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and remeasure to fair value at each\nreporting date until the contingency is resolved. As a result of that remeasurement, we reduced the contingent consideration liability by $0.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Other expense for 2016 was $0.3 million compared to other income of $1.7 million for 2015. The $2.0 million change was primarily due to the net reversal of $1.9 million of contingent consideration in 2015 as Ram-Fab, Vadnais and Surber missed financial targets contemplated in their respective purchase agreements.\nInterest income is derived from interest earned on excess cash invested primarily in short term U.S. Treasury bills, backed by the federal government.\nInterest expense decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a lower average debt balance. Interest expense increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a higher average debt balance. The weighted average interest rate on total debt outstanding at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was 3.0%, 2.9% and 2.9%, respectively.\nProvision for income taxes\nOur provision for income tax increased $7.3 million to $28.4 million for 2017 compared to 2016. Increased pretax profits in 2017 of $53.0 million drove an increase in income tax of $23.4 million using the 2016 effective tax rate. This increase in income tax was offset by a $9.4 million decrease in income tax from the remeasurement of our U.S. deferred tax liability and a $6.7 million decrease due to a decrease in 2017 effective tax rates. The remeasurement benefit is a provisional estimate under SAB 118 that could be revised once we finalize our deductions for tax depreciation and executive compensation accruals. We may also revise our estimate based on any additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, and other standard-setting bodies.\nThe 2017 effective tax rate on income including noncontrolling interests was 27.0%. The 2017 effective tax rate on income attributable to Primoris (excluding noncontrolling interests) was 28.2%. Three factors contributed to the decrease in the 2017 effective tax rate compared to 2016. First, state effective tax rates decreased due to changes in the mix of profit by state and the implementation of state tax planning. Second, partially nondeductible per diem expenses stayed relatively constant year over year despite the increase in pretax profits. Lastly, the benefit of the domestic production activities deduction increased compared to 2016.\nOur provision for income tax decreased $2.8 million to $21.1 million for 2016 compared to 2015 primarily as a result of the decrease in pretax profits.\nSegment Results\nPower Segment\nRevenue and gross profit for the Power segment for the years ending December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\n\n2017 and 2016\nRevenue increased by $127.5 million, or 26.6%, during 2017 compared to 2016. The growth is primarily due to progress on our joint venture power plant projects in Southern California ($115.3 million), a power plant construction project in the Mid-Atlantic region that began late in the third quarter of 2016 ($42.9 million) and a methane plant project in Texas that started in 2017. In addition, we benefited from acquisitions completed in November 2016 and May 2017 ($20.3 million). The overall increase was partially offset by the substantial completion of a large petrochemical plant in Louisiana in the second quarter of 2017 ($42.0 million) and the completion of two large parking structures in 2016.\nGross profit increased by $15.9 million, or 31.9%, during 2017 compared to 2016. The increase is primarily attributable to the revenue growth and the impact of acquired operations ($1.6 million). Gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 10.8% in 2017 compared to 10.4% in 2016 primarily as a result of an improved revenue mix.\n2016 and 2015\nRevenue increased by $12.3 million, or 2.6%, during 2016 compared to 2015. The increase is primarily due to a $60.6 million increase at Primoris Industrial Constructors from a large petrochemical project in Louisiana, partially offset by a $50.1 million decrease at OnQuest and OnQuest Canada from the completion of projects in 2015 that were not fully replaced in 2016.\nGross profit decreased by $3.8 million, or 7.1%, during 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease is primarily due to a $8.6 million reduction at ARB Industrial from a reduction in revenues and a decrease of $6.7 million at OnQuest and OnQuest Canada as a result of reducted volumes. These decreases are partially offset by an $11.6 million increase at Primoris Industiral Constructors from increased volume at the large petrochemical project in Louisiana.\nGross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to 10.4% in 2016 compared to 11.5% in 2015. The decline in margin is largely attributable to the low margin percentage realized by two joint venture projects in process, which accounted for 5.6% of the Power segment's revenues in 2016 versus 0.9% in 2015.\nPipeline and Underground Segment\nRevenue and gross profit for the Pipeline segment for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\n\nAs discussed in the section Receivable Collection Actions\u201d, during the third quarter of 2016, we collected a disputed receivable related to a major pipeline project completed in 2014, which resulted in recognizing revenue of approximately $27.5 million and gross profit of approximately $26.7 million. The following discussion excludes the impact of this collection, which was a one-time item.\n2017 and 2016\nRevenue increased by $91.2 million, or 24.4%, during 2017 compared to 2016. The increase is primarily due to two large pipeline jobs in Florida, which began in the third quarter of 2016 ($31.6 million) and activity on a pipeline project in Pennsylvania that began in 2017 ($52.0 million). In addition, impact of the acquired Coastal operations ($17.9 million) also benefited 2017. The overall increase was partially offset by a reduction in maintenance work ($31.1 million).\nGross profit increased by $50.7 million, or 122.5%, during 2017 compared to 2016. The increase is attributable to the combination of revenue growth and our strong performance on the two pipeline jobs in Florida, where we experienced good weather conditions resulting in no weather delays and high productivity. In addition, the acquisition of Coastal in 2017 contributed gross profit of $3.2 million. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to 19.8% in 2017 compared to 11.1% in 2016. The increase is due to the good weather conditions noted above, which is not common and not to be expected in the future.\n2016 and 2015\nRevenue increased by $75.0 million, or 25.1%, during 2016 compared to 2015. The increase is primarily due to a $64.1 million increase at Rockford from two large pipeline projects in Florida which started in the third quarter of 2016 and a $6.1 million increase at Primoris Pipeline from several smaller diameter pipeline projects in Texas.\nGross profit increased by $16.7 million, or 67.6%, during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a $15.4 million increase from the Rockford Florida projects described above. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 11.1% in 2016 compared to 8.2% in 2015 primarily as a result of the increase in revenues.\nUtilities Segment\nRevenue and gross profit for the Utilities segment for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\n\n2017 and 2016\nRevenue increased by $169.3 million, or 26.6%, during 2017 compared to 2016. The increase is primarily attributable to higher activity with two major utility customers in California ($67.7 million) and two major utility customers in the Midwest ($32.3 million). In addition, higher revenue from a collaboration MSA arrangement for a major utility customer in California ($35.6 million) and the impact of the acquired FGC operations ($15.5 million) also benefited 2017.\nGross profit increased $12.9 million, or 12.9%, during 2017 compared to 2016. The increase is primarily due the growth in revenue and the impact of acquired operations. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to 14.0% in 2017 compared to 15.7% in 2016 primarily as a result of lower gross margins on the collaboration MSA work.\n2016 and 2015\nRevenue increased by $50.2 million, or 8.6%, during 2016 compared to 2015. The increase is primarily due to a $35.4 million increase at ARB Underground from a new collaboration MSA arrangement as well as a $12.1 million increase at Q3C from increased volume.\nGross profit increased by $3.6 million, or 3.7%, during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to increased profitability at Q3C. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to 15.7% in 2016 compared to 16.4% in 2015. The decrease was primarily the result of lower margins on the collaboration MSA work.\nCivil Segment\nRevenue and gross profit for the Civil segment for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\n\nIn the third quarter of 2016, we recorded a $37.3 million write-down related to the Belton area projects. The following discussion excludes the impact of the write-down.\n2017 and 2016\nRevenue increased by $22.6 million, or 4.7%, during 2017 compared to 2016. The increase is primarily due to progress on a methanol plant project in Louisiana that began in 2017 ($31.9 million) and higher volume on the Belton area projects ($23.3 million). The overall increase was partially offset by substantial completion of a large petrochemical plant project in Lousiana in the first half of 2017.\nGross profit decreased by $13.0 million, or 63.1%, during 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease was primarily due to higher costs on two Arkansas DOT projects and one Louisiana DOT project, despite the revenue increase.\nGross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to 1.5% in 2017 compared to 4.3% in 2016. The decrease was primarily the result of the project cost impacts noted above.\nRevenue at the Belton area projects was $144.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, representing 28.9% of total Civil revenue. Revenue for which no margin was recognized was $134.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, of which $78.6 million was from the Belton area projects. During 2017, the four Belton area jobs in a loss position contributed $2.4 million gross profit as a result of lower anticipated costs. Two of the Belton area jobs in a loss position were completed during 2017, and the remaining two loss jobs are schedule to be completed in 2018. At December 31, 2017, the accrued loss provision for the four Belton area projects was $5.0 million and estimated remaining revenue for the two open jobs in a loss position was $49.0 million. The remaining Belton area job contributed $0.3 million gross profit during the year ended December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2017, estimated revenue for the job was $88.0 million, with completion scheduled for early 2019.\n2016 and 2015\nRevenue decreased by $97.5 million, or 16.9%, during 2016 compared to 2015. Revenue at Primoris I&M ( I&M\u201d) decreased by $76.4 million due primarily to the large petrochemical project in Louisiana and decreases in Texas I&M work. Primoris Heavy Civil division revenue decreased by $24.5 million. Decreases in Louisiana DOT projects of $19.4 million and Mississippi DOT projects of $58.9 million were offset by increases in Arkansas DOT projects of $6.7 million, Texas DOT projects of $8.4 million and airport projects of $31.7 million.\nGross profit decreased by $24.5 million, or 54.3%, during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to decreased revenue at Primoris I&M.\nGross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to 4.3% in 2016 compared to 7.8% in 2015 primarily as a result of the decrease in revenues.\nPlanned Divestiture of Texas Heavy Civil Business Unit\nIn October 2016, we announced that we planned", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes to those statements included as item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion includes forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties and unknown or changed circumstances. For a further discussion, please see Forward Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those risks inherent with our business as discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d.\nThe following discussion starts with an overview of our business and a discussion of trends, including seasonality, that affect our industry. That is followed by an overview of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. Next we discuss our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources, including our off-balance sheet transactions and contractual obligations. We conclude with a discussion of our outlook and backlog.\nIntroduction\nPrimoris is a holding company of various subsidiaries, which form one of the larger publicly traded specialty contractors and infrastructure companies in the United States. Serving diverse end-markets, we provide a wide range of construction, fabrication, maintenance, replacement, water and wastewater, and engineering services to major public utilities, petrochemical companies, energy companies, municipalities, state departments of transportation and other customers. We install, replace, repair and rehabilitate natural gas, refined product, water and wastewater pipeline systems; large diameter gas and liquid pipeline facilities; and heavy civil projects, earthwork and site development. We also construct mechanical facilities and other structures, including power plants, petrochemical facilities, refineries, water and wastewater treatment facilities and parking structures. Finally, we provide specialized process and product engineering services.\nWe have longstanding customer relationships with major utility, refining, petrochemical, power and engineering companies. We have completed major underground and industrial projects for a number of large natural gas transmission and petrochemical companies in the United States, as well as significant projects for our engineering customers. We enter into a large number of contracts each year, and the projects can vary in length from several weeks to as long as 60 months, or longer for completion on larger projects. Although we have not been dependent upon any one customer in any year, a small number of customers tend to constitute a substantial portion of our total revenues.\nThrough the end of the year 2016, we segregated our business into three reportable segments: the Energy segment, the East Construction Services segment and the West Construction Services segment. In the first quarter 2017, we changed our reportable segments in connection with a realignment of our internal organization and management structure. The segment changes reflect the focus of our chief operating decision maker ( CODM\u201d) on the range of services we provide to our end user markets. Our CODM regularly reviews our operating and financial performance based on these segments.\nThe current reportable segments include the Power, Industrial, and Engineering segment, the Pipeline and Underground segment, the Utilities and Distribution segment, and the Civil segment. See Note 14 - Reportable Segments\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a brief description of the reportable segments and their operations.\nThe classification of revenues and gross profit for segment reporting purposes can at times require judgment on the part of management. Our segments may perform services across industries or perform joint services for customers in\nmultiple industries. To determine reportable segment gross profit, certain allocations, including allocations of shared and indirect costs, such as facility costs, equipment costs and indirect operating expenses were made.\nThe following table lists our primary business units and their reportable segment:\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBusiness Unit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nReportable Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPrior Reportable Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nARB Industrial (a division of ARB, Inc.)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPower\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWest\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nARB Structures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPower\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWest\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrimoris Power (formerly PES Saxon division)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPower\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEnergy\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrimoris Renewable Energy (a division of Primoris AV)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPower\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEnergy\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrimoris Industrial Constructors (formerly PES Industrial Division)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPower\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEnergy\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrimoris Fabrication (a division of PES)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPower\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEnergy\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrimoris Mechanical Contractors (a combination of a division of PES and Cardinal Contractors)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPower\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEnergy\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOnQuest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPower\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEnergy\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOnQuest Canada\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPower\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEnergy\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrimoris Design and Construction ( PD&C\u201d); created 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPower\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNA\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRockford Corporation ( Rockford\u201d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPipeline\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWest\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nVadnais Trenchless Services ( Vadnais Trenchless\u201d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPipeline\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWest\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrimoris Field Services (a division of PES Primoris Pipeline)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPipeline\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEnergy\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrimoris Pipeline (a division of PES Primoris Pipeline)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPipeline\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEnergy\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrimoris Coastal Field Services; created 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPipeline\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNA\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nARB Underground (a division of ARB, Inc.)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nUtilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWest\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nQ3 Contracting ( Q3C\u201d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nUtilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWest\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrimoris AV\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nUtilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEnergy\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrimoris Distribution Services (\"PDS\"); created 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nUtilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNA\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrimoris Heavy Civil (formerly JCG Heavy Civil Division)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCivil\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEast\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrimoris I&M (formerly JCG Infrastructure & Maintenance Division)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCivil\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEast\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrimoris Build Own Operate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCivil\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEast\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe own a 50% interest in two separate joint ventures, both formed in 2015. The Carlsbad Power Constructors joint venture ( Carlsbad\u201d) is engineering and constructing a gas-fired power generation facility, and the ARB Inc. & B&M Engineering Co.\u201d joint venture ( Wilmington\u201d) is also engineering and constructing a gas-fired power generation facility. Both projects are located in Southern California. The joint venture operations are included as part of the Power segment. As a result of determining that we are the primary beneficiary of the two variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d), the results of the Carlsbad and Wilmington joint ventures are consolidated in our financial statements. Both projects are expected to be completed in 2018.\nWe owned 50% of the Blythe Power Constructors joint venture ( Blythe\u201d) created for the installation of a parabolic trough solar field and steam generation system in California, and its operations have been included as part of the Power segment. We determined that in accordance with FASB Topic 810, we were the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and have consolidated the results of Blythe in our financial statements. The project has been completed, the project warranty expired in May 2015, and dissolution of the joint venture was completed in the third quarter of 2015.\nFinancial information for the joint ventures is presented in Note 12- Noncontrolling Interests\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nWe continue to be acquisitive, and the following outlines the various acquisitions made over the past three years. See Note 4- Business Combinations\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K\nOn February 28, 2015, we acquired the net assets of Aevenia, Inc. for $22.3 million. Aevenia operations are included in the Utilities segment.\nOn January 29, 2016, we acquired the net assets of Mueller Concrete Construction Company (\"Mueller\") for $4.1 million, and on November 18, 2016, we acquired the net assets of Northern Energy & Power ( Northern\u201d) for $6.9 million. On June 24, 2016, we purchased property, plant and equipment from Pipe Jacking Unlimited, Inc. ( Pipe Jacking\u201d), consisting of specialty directional drilling and tunneling equipment for $13.4 million. We determined this purchase did not meet the definition of a business as defined under ASC 805. Mueller operations are included in the Utilities segment, Northern operations are included in the Power segment, and Pipe Jacking operations are included in the Pipeline segment.\nOn May 26, 2017, we acquired the net assets of Florida Gas Contractors ( FGC\u201d) for $37.7 million; on May 30, 2017, we acquired certain engineering assets for approximately $2.3 million; and on June 16, 2017, we acquired the net assets of Coastal Field Services ( Coastal\u201d) for $27.5 million. FGC operations are included in the Utilities segment, the engineering assets are included in the Power segment, and Coastal operations are included in the Pipeline segment.\nIn August 2017, we announced we are investing approximately $22.0 million to build, own, and operate a portfolio of solar projects in a California School District acquired from the developers, Spear Point Energy, LLC, and PFMG Solar, LLC. This investment amount includes the estimated cost of Engineering, Procurement, and Construction ( EPC\u201d) work on the projects, which is projected to be completed in 2018. The solar projects are expected to generate a 25-year recurring revenue stream from the District's signed power purchase agreement. As an investment in a renewable energy project, the solar assets should provide us with investment tax credits valued at over $5.0 million. As of December 31, 2017, our investment for the solar projects was approximately $9.9 million. The $9.9 million investment is our construction in progress on the solar projects and is included in Property and equipment, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nMaterial trends and uncertainties\nWe generate our revenue from both large and small construction and engineering projects. The award of these contracts is dependent on many factors, most of which are not within our control. We depend in part on spending by companies in the energy and oil and gas industries, the gas utility industry, as well as municipal water and wastewater customers. Over the past several years, each segment has benefited from demand for more efficient and more environmentally friendly energy and power facilities, local highway and bridge needs and from the activity level in the oil and gas industry. However, periodically, each of these industries and government agencies is adversely affected by macroeconomic conditions. Economic factors outside of our control may affect the amount and size of contracts we are awarded in any particular period.\nWe closely monitor our customers to assess the effect that changes in economic, market and regulatory conditions may have on them. We have experienced reduced spending by some of our customers over the last several years, which we attribute to negative economic and market conditions, and we anticipate that these negative conditions may continue to affect demand for our services in the near-term. Fluctuations in market prices of oil, gas and other fuel sources have affected demand for our services. While we have seen signs of a recovery in the price of oil, the significant volatility in the price of oil, gas and liquid natural gas that occurred in the past few years has created uncertainty with respect to demand for our oil and gas pipeline services both in the near-term and for future projects. We believe that our upstream operations, such as the construction of gathering lines within the oil shale formations, will remain at lower levels for an extended period. While there was some stability in the price of oil in 2017, that stability has not resulted in a significant change in the contracting activities of our customers. We believe that over time, the need for pipeline infrastructure for mid-stream and gas utility companies will result in a continuing need for our services, but the impact of the low oil prices may delay midstream pipeline opportunities. The continuing changes in the regulatory environment also affect the demand for our services, either by increasing our work or delaying projects. For example, the regulatory environment in California may result in delays for the construction of gas-fired power plants while regulators continue to search for significant renewable resources, but renewable resources may also create a demand for our construction services such as the need for storage of renewable generated electricity. Finally, we believe that regulated utility customers will continue to invest in our maintenance and replacement services.\nSeasonality, cyclicality and variability\nOur results of operations are subject to quarterly variations. Some of the variation is the result of weather, particularly rain, ice and snow, which can impact our ability to perform construction services. While the majority of our work is in the southern half of the United States, these seasonal impacts can affect revenues and profitability in all of our businesses since gas and other utilities defer routine replacement and repair during their period of peak demand. Any quarter can be affected either negatively or positively by atypical weather patterns in any part of the country. In addition, demand for new projects tends to be lower during the early part of the year due to clients' internal budget cycles. As a result, we usually experience higher revenues and earnings in the third and fourth quarters of the year as compared to the first two quarters.\nWe are also dependent on large construction projects which tend not to be seasonal, but can fluctuate from year to year based on general economic conditions. Our business may be affected by declines or delays in new projects or by client project schedules. Because of the cyclical nature of our business, the financial results for any period may fluctuate from prior periods, and our financial condition and operating results may vary from quarter to quarter. Results from one quarter may not be indicative of financial condition or operating results for any other quarter or for an entire year.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGeneral-The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and also affect the amounts of revenues and expenses reported for each period. These estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available, is dependent on future events, or is not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. Often, estimates are particularly difficult to determine, and we must exercise significant judgment. Estimates may be used in our assessments of revenue recognition under percentage-of-completion accounting, the allowance for doubtful accounts, useful lives of property and equipment, fair value assumptions in analyzing goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, self-insured claims liabilities and deferred income taxes. Actual results could differ from those that result from using the estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nThe following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Management's estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. We periodically review these accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nRevenue recognition-We generate revenue under a range of contracting options, including fixed-price, unit-price, time and material, and cost reimbursable plus fee contracts. A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from contracts that are fixed-price or unit-price, using the percentage-of-completion method. For time and material and cost reimbursable plus fee contracts, revenue is recognized primarily based on contractual terms. Generally, time and material and cost reimbursable contract revenues are recognized on an input basis, based on labor hours incurred and on purchases made.\nIn the percentage-of-completion method, estimated contract values, estimated cost at completion and total costs incurred to date are used to calculate revenues earned. Unforeseen events and circumstances can alter the estimate of the costs and potential profit associated with a particular contract. Total estimated costs, and thus contract revenues and income, can be impacted by changes in productivity, scheduling, the unit cost of labor, subcontracts, materials and equipment. Additionally, external factors such as weather, client needs, client delays in providing permits and approvals,\nlabor availability, governmental regulation and politics may affect the progress of a project's completion and thus the timing of revenue recognition.\nTo the extent that original cost estimates are modified, estimated costs to complete increase, delivery schedules are delayed, or progress under a contract is otherwise impeded, cash flow, revenue recognition and profitability from a particular contract may be adversely affected. As a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts, we review and update our contract-related estimates regularly. We recognize adjustments in estimated profit on contracts as changes in accounting estimates in the period in which the revisions are identified. Revenue and profit in future periods of contract performance are recognized using the adjusted estimate.\nIf at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on a contract, the projected loss is recognized in full in the period it is identified and recognized as an accrued loss provision\u201d which is included in the accrued expenses and other current liabilities amount on the balance sheet. For contract revenue recognized under the percentage-of-completion method, the accrued loss provision is adjusted so that the gross profit for the contract remains zero in future periods. The provision for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts was $10.1 million and $12.8 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nWe consider unapproved change orders to be contract variations for which customers have not agreed to both scope and price. Costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in the estimated cost to complete and are treated as project costs as incurred. We will recognize a change in contract value if we believe it is probable that the contract price will be adjusted and can be reliably estimated. Unapproved change orders involve the use of estimates, and it is reasonably possible that revisions to the estimated costs and recoverable amounts may be required in future reporting periods to reflect changes in estimates or final agreements with customers.\nWe consider claims to be amounts we seek, or will seek, to collect from customers or others for customer-caused changes in contract specifications or design, or other customer-related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs on which there is no agreement with customers. Claims can also be caused by non-customer-caused changes, such as rain or other weather delays. Costs associated with claims are included in the estimated costs to complete the contracts and are treated as project costs when incurred. Claims are included in revenue to the extent we have a reasonable legal basis, the related costs have been incurred, realization is probable, and amounts can be reliably estimated. Revenue in excess of contract costs from claims is recognized after an agreement is reached with customers as to the value of the claims, which in some instances may not occur until after completion of work under the contract.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had unapproved change orders and claims included in the expected contract value that totaled approximately $67.8 million. These claims were in the process of being negotiated in the normal course of business. Approximately $56.7 million of unapproved change orders and claims had been recognized as revenue on a cumulative percentage-of-completion basis through December 31, 2017.\nIn all forms of contracts, we estimate the collectability of contract amounts at the same time that we estimate project costs. If we anticipate that there may be issues associated with the collectability of the full amount calculated as revenues, we may reduce the amount recognized as revenue to reflect the uncertainty associated with realization of the eventual cash collection. For example, when a cost reimbursable project exceeds the client's expected budget amount, the client frequently requests an adjustment to the final amount. Similarly, some utility clients reserve the right to audit costs for significant periods after performance of the work. In these situations, we may choose to defer recognition of a portion of the revenue until the client pays for the services.\nThe caption Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings\u201d in the Consolidated Balance Sheets represents unbilled receivables which arise when revenues have been recorded but the amount will not be billed until a later date. Balances represent: (a) unbilled amounts arising from the use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting which may not be billed under the terms of the contract until a later date or project milestone; (b) incurred costs to be billed under cost reimbursable type contracts, including amounts arising from routine lags in billing; or (c) the revenue associated with unapproved change orders or claims when realization is probable and amounts can be reliably estimated. For those contracts in which billings exceed contract revenues recognized to date, the excess amounts are included in the caption Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings\u201d.\nIn accordance with applicable terms of certain construction contracts, retainage amounts may be withheld by customers until completion and acceptance of the project. Some payments of the retainage may not be received for a significant period after completion of our portion of a project. In some jurisdictions, retainage amounts are deposited into an escrow account.\nValuation of acquired businesses-We use the fair value of the consideration paid and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to account for the purchase price of businesses. The determination of fair value requires estimates and judgments of future cash flow expectations for the assignment of the fair values to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets.\nIdentifiable Tangible Assets. Significant identifiable tangible assets acquired would include accounts receivable, costs and earnings in excess of billings for projects, inventory and fixed assets (generally consisting of construction equipment) for each acquisition. We determine the fair value of these assets as of the acquisition date. For current assets and current liabilities of an acquisition, we will evaluate whether the book value is equivalent to fair value due to their short term nature. We estimate the fair value of fixed assets using a market approach, based on comparable market values for similar equipment of similar condition and age.\nIdentifiable Intangible Assets. When necessary, we use the assistance of an independent third party valuation specialist to determine the fair value of the intangible assets acquired in the acquisitions.\nA liability for contingent consideration based on future earnings is estimated at its fair value at the date of acquisition, with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in earnings as a gain or loss. Fair value is estimated as of the acquisition date using estimated earnout payments based on management's best estimate.\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States provide a measurement period\u201d of up to one year in which to finalize all fair value estimates associated with the acquisition of a business. Most estimates are preliminary until the end of the measurement period. During the measurement period, adjustments to initial valuations and estimates that reflect newly discovered information that existed at the acquisition date are recorded. After the measurement date, any adjustments would be recorded as a current period gain or loss.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived intangible Assets-Goodwill and certain intangible assets acquired in a business combination and determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are assessed for impairment annually and more frequently if triggering events occur. In performing these assessments, management relies on various factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable transactions and other market data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill for impairment. Since judgment is involved in performing fair value measurements used in goodwill impairment analyses, there is risk that the carrying values of our goodwill may not be properly stated.\nWe account for goodwill, including evaluation of any goodwill impairment under ASC 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other\u201d, performed at the reporting unit level for those units with recorded goodwill as of October 1 of each year, unless there are indications requiring a more frequent impairment test.\nGoodwill has arisen from acquisitions and is recorded at our segments as follows at December 31 (in thousands):\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReporting Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPower\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n24,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n24,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPipeline\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n51,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n42,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUtilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n37,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCivil\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n40,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n40,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Goodwill\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n153,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n127,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnder ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other\u201d, we can assess qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative impairment test of intangible assets is necessary. Typically, however, we use the two-step impairment test outlined in ASC 350. First, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. Fair value for the goodwill impairment test is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on our financial plan discounted using our weighted average cost of capital and market indicators of terminal year cash flows. Other valuation methods may be used to corroborate the discounted cash flow method. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit is in excess of its fair value, goodwill is considered potentially impaired and further tests are performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. In the second step of the goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination was determined. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill.\nDuring the third quarter of 2016, we made a decision to divest the Texas heavy civil business unit, a division of Primoris Heavy Civil within the Civil segment. We engaged a financial advisor to assist in the marketing and sale of the business unit, and planned to continue operating the business unit until completion of a sale. In April 2017, the Board of Directors determined that based on the information available, we would attain the best long-term value by withdrawing from the sales process and continuing to operate the business unit.\nUnder the provisions of ASC 350, the planned divestiture triggered an analysis of the goodwill amount of Primoris Heavy Civil. The analysis resulted in a pretax, non-cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately $2.7 million in the third quarter of 2016.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, an impairment expense of $0.4 million was recorded relating to the goodwill attributed to Cardinal Contractors, Inc., which is a part of the Power segment. There were no other impairments of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nDisruptions to our business, such as end market conditions, protracted economic weakness, unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units and the divestiture of a significant component of a reporting unit, may result in our having to perform a goodwill impairment first step valuation analysis for some or all of our reporting units prior to the required annual assessment. These types of events and the resulting analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in any periods in the future.\nReserve for uninsured risks-Estimates are inherent in the assessment of our exposure to uninsured risks. Significant judgments by us and, where possible, third-party experts are needed in determining probable and/or reasonably estimable amounts that should be recorded or disclosed in the financial statements. Semiannually, we obtain a third-party actuarial valuation for some of our uninsured risks. The results of any changes in accounting estimates are reflected in the financial statements of the period in which we determine we need to record a change.\nWe self-insure worker's compensation claims up to $0.25 million per claim. We maintained a self-insurance reserve totaling approximately $18.5 million at December 31, 2017 and approximately $18.8 million at December 31, 2016. Claims administration expenses were charged to current operations as incurred. Our accruals are based on judgment, the probability of losses, and where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and third party consultants. The amount is included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities\u201d on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Actual payments that may be made in the future could materially differ from such reserves.\nIncome taxes-We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method as set forth in ASC 740, Income Taxes\u201d, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and tax bases of\nassets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of changes in tax rates on net deferred tax assets or liabilities is recognized as an increase or decrease in net income in the period the tax change is enacted.\nDeferred tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance if, in the judgment of our management, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available evidence, including recent financial operations, projected future taxable income, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies, and the length of tax asset carryforward periods. The realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable earnings in certain jurisdictions. If we subsequently determine that some or all deferred tax assets that were previously offset by a valuation allowance are realizable, the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased by reducing the valuation allowance, thereby increasing income in the period when that determination is made. During 2017, we determined it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax asset for foreign tax credits will not be realized. Accordingly, a valuation allowance of $0.6 million was recorded.\nA tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained based on its technical merits in a tax examination, using the presumption that the tax authority has full knowledge of all relevant facts regarding the position. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on ultimate settlement with the tax authority. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test, no tax benefit is recorded.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act-On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that affect our 2017 results, including the allowance of bonus depreciation that provides for immediate deduction of qualified property placed in service after September 27, 2017. The Tax Act also establishes new tax laws that may affect our 2018 and future results, including but not limited to:\n \u00b7 Reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%; \n \u00b7 The repeal of the domestic production activities deduction; \n \u00b7 Further limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation; \n \u00b7 Disallowance of certain entertainment expense deductions; \n \u00b7 Limitations on the use of foreign tax credits to reduce the U.S. income tax liability; \n \u00b7 Limitations on interest expense deductibility; \n \u00b7 Elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax. \nWhile the Tax Act also contains complex changes to the tax code for companies operating internationally, we are not materially impacted by the international provisions of the Tax Act.\nGiven the significant impact of the legislation, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB\u201d) 118 which provides guidance on accounting for uncertainties of the effects of the Tax Act. Specifically, SAB 118 allows companies to record provisional estimates of the impact of the Tax Act during a one year measurement period\u201d similar to that used when accounting for business combinations.\nAs a result of the Tax Act, we remeasured our deferred tax assets and liabilities using the newly enacted tax rates and recorded a one-time net tax benefit of $9.4 million in the period ended December 31, 2017. This tax benefit is a provisional estimate that could be revised once we finalize our deductions for tax depreciation and executive compensation accruals. We may also revise our estimate based on any additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, and other standard-setting bodies.\nLong-Lived Assets-Assets held and used by us, primarily property, plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable. We perform an undiscounted operation cash flow analysis to determine if an impairment exists. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identified. If an impairment is determined to exist, any related\nimpairment loss is calculated based on fair value. The calculation of the fair value of long-lived assets is based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of long-lived assets, the future carrying value of our long-lived assets may have differing future fair values.\nMultiemployer plans - Various subsidiaries are signatories to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements require that we participate in and contribute to a number of multiemployer benefit plans for our union employees at rates determined by the agreements. The trustees for each multiemployer plan determine the eligibility and allocations of contributions and benefit amounts, determine the types of benefits, and administer the plan. To the extent that any plans are underfunded, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, requires that if we were to withdraw from an agreement or if a plan is terminated, we may incur a withdrawal obligation. Since the withdrawal liability is based on estimates of our proportional share of the plan's unfunded vested liability, as calculated by the plan's actuaries, the potential withdrawal obligation may be significant.\nIn November 2011, members of the Pipe Line Contractors Association PLCA\u201d including ARB, Rockford and Q3C (prior to our acquisition in 2012), withdrew from the Central States Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund multiemployer pension plan ( Plan\u201d). These withdrawals were made in order to mitigate additional liability in connection with the significantly underfunded Plan. We recorded a withdrawal liability of $7.5 million, which was increased to $7.6 million after the acquisition of Q3C. During the first quarter of 2016, we received a final payment schedule. As a result of payments made and based on this schedule, the liability recorded at December 31, 2017 was $4.7 million. We expect to pay the remaining liability balance during 2018 and have no plans to withdraw from any other labor agreements.\nLitigation and contingencies-Litigation and contingencies are included in our consolidated financial statements based on our assessment of the expected outcome of litigation proceedings or the expected resolution of the contingency. We provide for costs related to contingencies when a loss from such claims is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. In determining whether it is possible to provide an estimate of loss, or range of possible loss, we review and evaluate litigation and regulatory matters on a quarterly basis in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. If we determine an unfavorable outcome is not probable or reasonably estimable, we do not accrue for a potential litigation loss. Management is unable to ascertain the ultimate outcome of other claims and legal proceedings; however, after review and consultation with counsel and taking into consideration relevant insurance coverage and related deductibles/self-insurance retention, management believes that it has meritorious defense to the claims and believes that the reasonably possible outcome of such claims will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. See Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Results\nTwo events had a material impact on our results of operations in 2016. In the third quarter we received a $38.0 million settlement for one of the construction projects that we had identified as part of our Receivable Collection Actions\u201d, discussed below. Because we had recorded the project with zero gross profit, the settlement added $27.5 million to revenues and $26.7 million to gross profit. Also in the third quarter, we recorded a charge of $37.3 million primarily related to certain Belton, Texas area projects for the Texas Department of Transportation ( TXDOT\u201d), as a result of project delays and productivity issues.\nRevenues\n2017 and 2016\nRevenues for year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $383.0 million, or 19.2%, compared to 2016. All segments reported year over year growth. Progress on three major pipeline jobs ($83.6 million), higher activity with major utility clients in California and the Midwest ($135.6 million) and progress on our joint venture power plant projects in Southern California and a Mid-Atlantic power plant project ($158.2 million combined) drove higher 2017 revenue. Also contributing to 2017 growth was higher volume on our Belton area (Civil) projects and a Louisiana methanol plant project. The overall increase was partially offset by decreases associated with projects substantially completed in 2017 and revenue recognized from the one-time benefit of the settlement of one of the Receivable Collection Actions\u201d in 2016. Revenue from 2017 acquisitions and incremental revenue from 2016 acquisitions (where we only owned a business for a portion of the year) totaled $53.6 million.\n2016 and 2015\nRevenues for year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $67.5 million, or 3.5% compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $64.1 million from Rockford's pipeline work, $34.5 million for work at a large petrochemical project in Louisiana and $35.4 million from a new collaboration MSA arrangement at ARB Underground. These increases were partially offset by a revenue reduction of $50.1 million at OnQuest, a reduction of $16.4 million at Saxon, and a reduction of $24.5 million in Heavy Civil projects. Revenues for 2016 also included the one-time benefit of $27.5 million from the settlement of one of the Receivable Collection Actions\u201d.\nAs discussed in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d, we had unapproved change orders and claims included in contract value that totaled approximately $67.8 million at December 31, 2017. Of this amount, approximately $49.7 million was claims related to the Belton area projects.\nGross Profit\n2017 and 2016\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, gross profit increased by $77.1 million, or 38.3%, compared to 2016. All segments reported year over year improvement. Strong revenue growth and the favorable performance on the two large pipeline projects in Florida drove significant improvement. Also benefiting 2017 were higher volumes for the Power segment and better performance from Civil. The year over year increase was partially offset by $26.7 million of gross profit recognized in 2016 from the settlement of one of the Receivable Collection Actions\u201d. Gross Profit from 2017 acquisitions and incremental gross profit from 2016 acquisitions (where we only owned a business for a portion of the year) totaled $8.6 million. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 11.7% in 2017 from 10.1% in 2016 for the reasons noted above.\n2016 and 2015\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, gross profit decreased by $18.6 million, or 8.4% compared to 2015. The decrease was primarily from the decrease in Heavy Civil projects of $38.2 million, of which $33.4 million was from a decrease at the Belton area projects. Gross profit decreased by $6.1 million at the Louisiana petrochemical project, in spite of an increase in revenue, as the scope of our work has changed to less equipment intensive, lower margin work. Gross profit also decreased at ARB Underground by $6.3 million and $8.6 million at ARB Industrial with these decreases offset by a gross profit increase of $15.4 million at Rockford. Our gross profit benefitted by $26.7 million from the settlement of one of the Receivable Collection Actions\u201d. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased from 11.4% in 2015 to 10.1% in 2016 for the reasons noted above.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A\u201d) consist primarily of compensation and benefits to executive, management level and administrative employees, marketing and communications, professional fees, office rent and utilities and acquisition costs.\n2017 and 2016\nFor 2017, SG&A expenses were $172.1 million, compared to $140.8 million for 2016, an increase of $31.3 million. Approximately $12.4 million of the increase in SG&A is related to businesses acquired in 2017 and a full year of expense in 2017 for the Northern acquisition compared to less than two months of expense in 2016. The remaining increase was primarily due to a $12.6 million increase in compensation related expenses, including incentive compensation accruals; and a $1.3 million increase in legal costs.\nSG&A as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased slightly to 7.2% compared to 7.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, SG&A as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, decreased slightly to 6.9% compared to 7.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n2016 and 2015\nFor 2016, SG&A expenses were $140.8 million, compared to $151.7 million for 2015, a decrease of $10.9 million. The decrease was primarily as a result of decreases in professional fees of $7.4 million due to reduced legal fees and due to completion of the implementation of the integrated financial system. The reduction in SG&A was also the result of a $2.6 million prior year one-time valuation adjustment for the value of a long-term asset. Additionally, SG&A was reduced as a result of a decrease of $1.8 million in compensation and staffing levels.\nSG&A as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased to 7.1% compared to 7.9% for the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of the decreased expenses while revenues increased.\nOther income and expense\nNon-operating income and expense items for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvestment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nForeign exchange gain (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0.8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0.3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(8.1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(8.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(7.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal other income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(1.0)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(8.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(6.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment income for the year ended December 31, 2017 is related to a gain from a short-term investment in marketable equity securities.We purchased the securities in the third quarter of 2017 and sold the securities in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nForeign exchange gains and losses reflect currency exchange fluctuations of the United States dollar compared to the Canadian dollar. Many of our contracts in Calgary, Canada are sold based on United States dollars, but a portion of the work is paid for with Canadian dollars creating a currency exchange difference.\nOther income for 2017 was $0.5 million compared to other expense of $0.3 million for 2016. The $0.8 million change was primarily due to remeasurement of the contingent consideration related to the FGC performance target contemplated in their purchase agreement. Under ASC 805, we are required to estimate the fair value of contingent consideration based on facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and remeasure to fair value at each\nreporting date until the contingency is resolved. As a result of that remeasurement, we reduced the contingent consideration liability by $0.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Other expense for 2016 was $0.3 million compared to other income of $1.7 million for 2015. The $2.0 million change was primarily due to the net reversal of $1.9 million of contingent consideration in 2015 as Ram-Fab, Vadnais and Surber missed financial targets contemplated in their respective purchase agreements.\nInterest income is derived from interest earned on excess cash invested primarily in short term U.S. Treasury bills, backed by the federal government.\nInterest expense decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a lower average debt balance. Interest expense increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a higher average debt balance. The weighted average interest rate on total debt outstanding at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was 3.0%, 2.9% and 2.9%, respectively.\nProvision for income taxes\nOur provision for income tax increased $7.3 million to $28.4 million for 2017 compared to 2016. Increased pretax profits in 2017 of $53.0 million drove an increase in income tax of $23.4 million using the 2016 effective tax rate. This increase in income tax was offset by a $9.4 million decrease in income tax from the remeasurement of our U.S. deferred tax liability and a $6.7 million decrease due to a decrease in 2017 effective tax rates. The remeasurement benefit is a provisional estimate under SAB 118 that could be revised once we finalize our deductions for tax depreciation and executive compensation accruals. We may also revise our estimate based on any additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, and other standard-setting bodies.\nThe 2017 effective tax rate on income including noncontrolling interests was 27.0%. The 2017 effective tax rate on income attributable to Primoris (excluding noncontrolling interests) was 28.2%. Three factors contributed to the decrease in the 2017 effective tax rate compared to 2016. First, state effective tax rates decreased due to changes in the mix of profit by state and the implementation of state tax planning. Second, partially nondeductible per diem expenses stayed relatively constant year over year despite the increase in pretax profits. Lastly, the benefit of the domestic production activities deduction increased compared to 2016.\nOur provision for income tax decreased $2.8 million to $21.1 million for 2016 compared to 2015 primarily as a result of the decrease in pretax profits.\nSegment Results\nPower Segment\nRevenue and gross profit for the Power segment for the years ending December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSegment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSegment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSegment\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPower Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n606.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n478.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n466.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n65.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.8% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n49.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.4% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n53.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11.5% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 and 2016\nRevenue increased by $127.5 million, or 26.6%, during 2017 compared to 2016. The growth is primarily due to progress on our joint venture power plant projects in Southern California ($115.3 million), a power plant construction project in the Mid-Atlantic region that began late in the third quarter of 2016 ($42.9 million) and a methane plant project in Texas that started in 2017. In addition, we benefited from acquisitions completed in November 2016 and May 2017 ($20.3 million). The overall increase was partially offset by the substantial completion of a large petrochemical plant in Louisiana in the second quarter of 2017 ($42.0 million) and the completion of two large parking structures in 2016.\nGross profit increased by $15.9 million, or 31.9%, during 2017 compared to 2016. The increase is primarily attributable to the revenue growth and the impact of acquired operations ($1.6 million). Gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 10.8% in 2017 compared to 10.4% in 2016 primarily as a result of an improved revenue mix.\n2016 and 2015\nRevenue increased by $12.3 million, or 2.6%, during 2016 compared to 2015. The increase is primarily due to a $60.6 million increase at Primoris Industrial Constructors from a large petrochemical project in Louisiana, partially offset by a $50.1 million decrease at OnQuest and OnQuest Canada from the completion of projects in 2015 that were not fully replaced in 2016.\nGross profit decreased by $3.8 million, or 7.1%, during 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease is primarily due to a $8.6 million reduction at ARB Industrial from a reduction in revenues and a decrease of $6.7 million at OnQuest and OnQuest Canada as a result of reducted volumes. These decreases are partially offset by an $11.6 million increase at Primoris Industiral Constructors from increased volume at the large petrochemical project in Louisiana.\nGross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to 10.4% in 2016 compared to 11.5% in 2015. The decline in margin is largely attributable to the low margin percentage realized by two joint venture projects in process, which accounted for 5.6% of the Power segment's revenues in 2016 versus 0.9% in 2015.\nPipeline and Underground Segment\nRevenue and gross profit for the Pipeline segment for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSegment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSegment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSegment\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPipeline Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n465.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n401.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n299.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n92.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n19.8% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n68.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n16.9% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n24.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8.2% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs discussed in the section Receivable Collection Actions\u201d, during the third quarter of 2016, we collected a disputed receivable related to a major pipeline project completed in 2014, which resulted in recognizing revenue of approximately $27.5 million and gross profit of approximately $26.7 million. The following discussion excludes the impact of this collection, which was a one-time item.\n2017 and 2016\nRevenue increased by $91.2 million, or 24.4%, during 2017 compared to 2016. The increase is primarily due to two large pipeline jobs in Florida, which began in the third quarter of 2016 ($31.6 million) and activity on a pipeline project in Pennsylvania that began in 2017 ($52.0 million). In addition, impact of the acquired Coastal operations ($17.9 million) also benefited 2017. The overall increase was partially offset by a reduction in maintenance work ($31.1 million).\nGross profit increased by $50.7 million, or 122.5%, during 2017 compared to 2016. The increase is attributable to the combination of revenue growth and our strong performance on the two pipeline jobs in Florida, where we experienced good weather conditions resulting in no weather delays and high productivity. In addition, the acquisition of Coastal in 2017 contributed gross profit of $3.2 million. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to 19.8% in 2017 compared to 11.1% in 2016. The increase is due to the good weather conditions noted above, which is not common and not to be expected in the future.\n2016 and 2015\nRevenue increased by $75.0 million, or 25.1%, during 2016 compared to 2015. The increase is primarily due to a $64.1 million increase at Rockford from two large pipeline projects in Florida which started in the third quarter of 2016 and a $6.1 million increase at Primoris Pipeline from several smaller diameter pipeline projects in Texas.\nGross profit increased by $16.7 million, or 67.6%, during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a $15.4 million increase from the Rockford Florida projects described above.

The increase is primarily attributable to higher activity with two major utility customers in California ($67.7 million) and two major utility customers in the Midwest ($32.3 million). In addition, higher revenue from a collaboration MSA arrangement for a major utility customer in California ($35.6 million) and the impact of the acquired FGC operations ($15.5 million) also benefited 2017.\nGross profit increased $12.9 million, or 12.9%, during 2017 compared to 2016. The increase is primarily due the growth in revenue and the impact of acquired operations. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to 14.0% in 2017 compared to 15.7% in 2016 primarily as a result of lower gross margins on the collaboration MSA work.\n2016 and 2015\nRevenue increased by $50.2 million, or 8.6%, during 2016 compared to 2015. The increase is primarily due to a $35.4 million increase at ARB Underground from a new collaboration MSA arrangement as well as a $12.1 million increase at Q3C from increased volume.\nGross profit increased by $3.6 million, or 3.7%, during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to increased profitability at Q3C. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to 15.7% in 2016 compared to 16.4% in 2015. The decrease was primarily the result of lower margins on the collaboration MSA work.\nCivil Segment\nRevenue and gross profit for the Civil segment for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSegment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSegment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSegment\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCivil Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n501.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n479.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n576.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.5% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(16.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3.5%) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n45.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.8% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the third quarter of 2016, we recorded a $37.3 million write-down related to the Belton area projects. The following discussion excludes the impact of the write-down.\n2017 and 2016\nRevenue increased by $22.6 million, or 4.7%, during 2017 compared to 2016. The increase is primarily due to progress on a methanol plant project in Louisiana that began in 2017 ($31.9 million) and higher volume on the Belton area projects ($23.3 million). The overall increase was partially offset by substantial completion of a large petrochemical plant project in Lousiana in the first half of 2017.\nGross profit decreased by $13.0 million, or 63.1%, during 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease was primarily due to higher costs on two Arkansas DOT projects and one Louisiana DOT project, despite the revenue increase.\nGross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to 1.5% in 2017 compared to 4.3% in 2016. The decrease was primarily the result of the project cost impacts noted above.\nRevenue at the Belton area projects was $144.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, representing 28.9% of total Civil revenue. Revenue for which no margin was recognized was $134.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, of which $78.6 million was from the Belton area projects. During 2017, the four Belton area jobs in a loss position contributed $2.4 million gross profit as a result of lower anticipated costs. Two of the Belton area jobs in a loss position were completed during 2017, and the remaining two loss jobs are schedule to be completed in 2018. At December 31, 2017, the accrued loss provision for the four Belton area projects was $5.0 million and estimated remaining revenue for the two open jobs in a loss position was $49.0 million. The remaining Belton area job contributed $0.3 million gross profit during the year ended December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2017, estimated revenue for the job was $88.0 million, with completion scheduled for early 2019.\n2016 and 2015\nRevenue decreased by $97.5 million, or 16.9%, during 2016 compared to 2015. Revenue at Primoris I&M ( I&M\u201d) decreased by $76.4 million due primarily to the large petrochemical project in Louisiana and decreases in Texas I&M work. Primoris Heavy Civil division revenue decreased by $24.5 million. Decreases in Louisiana DOT projects of $19.4 million and Mississippi DOT projects of $58.9 million were offset by increases in Arkansas DOT projects of $6.7 million, Texas DOT projects of $8.4 million and airport projects of $31.7 million.\nGross profit decreased by $24.5 million, or 54.3%, during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to decreased revenue at Primoris I&M.\nGross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to 4.3% in 2016 compared to 7.8% in 2015 primarily as a result of the decrease in revenues.\nPlanned Divestiture of Texas Heavy Civil Business Unit\nIn October 2016, we announced that we planned"}
