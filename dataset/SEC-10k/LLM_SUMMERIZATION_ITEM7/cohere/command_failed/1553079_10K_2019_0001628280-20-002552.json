We owned 14 office properties (including three long-term ground leasehold interests) encompassing approximately 9.4 million rentable square feet of office space. Nine of these properties are located in the midtown Manhattan market and aggregate approximately 7.6 million rentable square feet of office space, including the Empire State Building. Our Manhattan office properties also contain an aggregate of 511,984 rentable square feet of premier retail space on their ground floor and/or contiguous levels. Our remaining five office properties are located in Fairfield County, Connecticut and Westchester County, New York, encompassing in the aggregate approximately 1.8 million rentable square feet. The majority of square footage for\nthese five properties is located in densely populated metropolitan communities with immediate access to mass transportation. Additionally, we have entitled land at the Stamford Transportation Center in Stamford, Connecticut, adjacent to one of our office properties, that will support the development of an approximately 415,000 rentable square foot office building and garage, which we refer to herein as Metro Tower. As of December 31, 2019, our portfolio included four standalone retail properties located in Manhattan and two standalone retail properties located in the city center of Westport, Connecticut, encompassing 205,595 rentable square feet in the aggregate.\nThe Empire State Building is our flagship property. The Empire State Building provides us with a diverse source of revenue through its office and retail leases, observatory operations, and broadcasting licenses and related leased space. Our observatory operations are a separate reporting segment. Our observatory operations are subject to regular patterns of tourist activity in Manhattan. During the past ten years, approximately 16% to 18% of our annual observatory revenue was realized in the first quarter, 26.0% to 28.0% was realized in the second quarter, 31.0% to 33.0% was realized in the third quarter, and 23.0% to 25.0% was realized in the fourth quarter.\nThe components of the Empire State Building revenue are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office leases\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail leases\n</td> <td>7,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant reimbursements, lease termination fees and other income\n</td> <td>31,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Observatory operations\n</td> <td>128,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>131,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Broadcasting licenses and leases\n</td> <td>16,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>327,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>335,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have been undertaking a comprehensive redevelopment and repositioning strategy of our Manhattan office properties. This strategy is designed to improve the overall value and attractiveness of our properties and has contributed significantly to our tenant repositioning efforts, which seek to increase our occupancy, raise our rental rates, increase our rentable square feet, increase our aggregate rental revenue, lengthen our average lease term, increase our average lease size, and improve our tenant credit quality. These improvements include restored, renovated and upgraded or new lobbies, elevator modernization, renovated public areas and bathrooms, refurbished or new windows, upgrade and standardization of retail storefront and signage, fa\u00e7ade restorations, modernization of building-wide systems, and enhanced tenant amenities. We have also aggregated smaller spaces in order to offer larger blocks of office space, including multiple floors, that are attractive to larger, higher credit-quality tenants as well as to offer new, pre-built suites with improved layouts. This strategy has shown what we believe to be attractive results to date, and we believe has the potential to improve our operating margins and cash flows in the future. We believe we will continue to enhance our tenant base and improve rents as our pre-redevelopment leases continue to expire and be re-leased. From 2002 through December 31, 2019, we have invested a total of approximately $918.6 million (excluding tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions) in our Manhattan office properties pursuant to this program. We intend to fund these capital improvements through a combination of operating cash flow, cash on hand, short term investments and borrowings.\nDuring the second quarter 2017, we commenced a multi-year capital project at the Empire State Building, which we completed during the fourth quarter 2019, that we believe improves the convenience for office tenants and their visitors, increases the value of our 34th Street facing retail space, enhances the Observatory visitor experience, and increases Observatory revenue per capita.\nIn the first phase completed in August 2018, we relocated the Observatory entrance, previously located on Fifth Avenue, to a new, larger, dedicated entrance for Observatory visitors at the western side of the Empire State Building on 34th Street. The new entrance eliminates Observatory visitor flow into the Fifth Avenue lobby and streamlines the visitor exit from that lobby, thereby reducing Observatory traffic in the lobby by more than 50% and improving Fifth Avenue access for our office tenants and their visitors.\nDuring the third quarter 2019 we opened the second phase of the project, the new second floor galleries and in the fourth quarter 2019 we completed the final phase, the redevelopment of the 80th floor and opened the newly renovated 102nd floor observatory.\nThe elevator servicing the 102nd floor Observatory was closed to visitors during the first quarter of 2018 for planned replacement of the original machinery and a new glass cab for the elevator which serves it. The 102nd floor Observatory was closed for approximately nine months in 2019 and opened on October 12, 2019. Revenue for the 102nd floor observatory was $3.6 million, $8.6 million and $11.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, The decrease in revenue is primarily related to the closures.\nWe have now completed all phases of this project. Expenditures for the improvement project, which began during the second quarter 2017, were $155.4 million through December 31, 2019. This investment is an example of continually looking at ways to innovate and enhance the office and retail tenant and visitor experience at the Empire State Building.\nThe Greater New York metropolitan area office market is soft, and we compete with properties that have been redeveloped recently or have planned redevelopment. We expect to spend approximately $40.0 million through 2020 on our well-maintained and well-located properties' common areas and amenities to enhance competitiveness and protect our market position. Expenditures, which began during the second quarter 2018, were $29.0 million through December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2019, excluding principal amortization, we had approximately $265.0 million of debt maturing in 2022, and we had total debt outstanding of approximately $1.7 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.03% (excluding premiums and discount) and a weighted average maturity of 8.3 years and 100.0% of which is fixed-rate indebtedness. As of December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $233.9 million. Our consolidated net debt to total market capitalization was approximately 25.2% as of December 31, 2019.\nResults of Operations\nOverview\nThe discussion below relates to the financial condition and

</tr>\n</table>\nRental Revenue and Tenant Expense Reimbursement\nWe adopted FASB Topic 842 using the modified retrospective approach as of January 1, 2019 and elected to apply the\ntransition provisions of the standard at adoption. As such, the prior period amounts presented under ASC 840 were not restated\nto conform with the 2019 presentation. We adopted the practical expedient in Topic 842, which allowed us to avoid separating\nlease and non-lease rental income. Consequently, all rental income earned pursuant to tenant leases in 2019 is reflected as one\ncategory, Rental Revenue,\u201d in the 2019 consolidated statement of income. The following table reflects the components of\n2019 rental revenue: Table 138: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Base rent\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>511,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant expense reimbursement\n</td> <td>75,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total rental revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>586,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe the preceding table of the components of rental revenue is not, and is not intended to be, a presentation in\naccordance with GAAP. It is provided here based on our understanding that such information is frequently used by management, investors, securities analysts and other interested parties to evaluate our performance.\nThe increase in base rent revenue was attributable to increased rental rates, partially offset by decreased broadcasting licenses and holdover rent.\nThe increase in billed tenant expense reimbursement was primarily due to reimbursements related to higher property\noperating expenses.\nObservatory Revenue\nObservatory revenues were lower primarily driven by the closure of the 102nd floor observation deck for approximately nine months in 2019 as part of the Observatory upgrade program and visitor decline, partially offset by improved pricing.\nLease Termination Fees\nThe year ended December 31, 2018 included significantly higher lease termination fees, from a combination of broadcast and office tenants, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThird-Party Management and Other Fees\nThe decrease reflects lower management fee income due to fewer assets under management.\nOther Revenues and Fees\nThe decrease in other revenues and fees is primarily due to a $2.8 million settlement with a former broadcast tenant recognized in the year ended December 31, 2018 partially offset by a property tax refund received in the year ended December 31, 2019.\nProperty Operating Expenses\nThe increase in property operating expenses was primarily due to higher repair and labor costs partially offset by lower utility costs.\nGround Rent Expenses\nThe ground rent expense was consistent with 2018.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased equity compensation expenses as well as higher leasing costs which were previously capitalized prior to our adoption of Topic 842, Lease Accounting on January 1, 2019, which requires that non-contingent leasing costs be expensed as incurred. Also contributing to the increase were costs associated with the 2019 private perpetual preferred units exchange offer.\nObservatory Expenses\nObservatory expenses increased primarily due to higher information technology consulting fees and higher marketing costs.\nReal Estate Taxes\nThe increase in real estate taxes was primarily attributable to higher assessed values for multiple properties.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe increase in depreciation and amortization was attributable to additional depreciation on assets newly placed in service during the year as well as the acceleration of depreciation of $2.0 million in connection with a partial termination agreement.\nInterest Income\nThe increase in interest income was primarily due to higher rates and the timing of short-term time deposits during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was consistent with 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nThe decrease in income tax expense was attributable to lower revenues and higher operating expenses for the Observatory segment.\nPrivate Perpetual Preferred Unit Distributions\nPrivate perpetual preferred unit distributions increased due to dividends paid on a new series of private perpetual preferred units issued by the operating partnership in December 2019 in connection with the settlement of an exchange offer for outstanding traded OP units. Holders of the new series of private perpetual preferred units are entitled to receive cumulative preferential annual cash distributions of $0.70 per units when, as and if declared by the board of directors of the company.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe following table summarizes the historical results of operations for years ended December 31,

in rental income was primarily attributable to increased rental rates.\nTenant Expense Reimbursement\nThe decrease in tenant expense reimbursements was due to a reduction in broadcasting expense reimbursements.\nObservatory Revenue\nObservatory revenues were higher primarily due to an improvement in our ticket mix and higher per person average\nticket price, partially offset by the scheduled closure of the 102nd floor observation deck in the first quarter 2018 for\nreplacement of original elevator machinery.\nLease Termination Fees\nThe year ended December 31, 2018 included significantly higher lease termination fees, from a combination of broadcast and office tenants, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThird-Party Management and Other Fees\nThird-party management and other fees were consistent with 2017.\nOther Revenues and Fees\nThe increase in other revenues and fees for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to a $2.8\nmillion settlement with a former broadcast tenant.\nProperty Operating Expenses\nThe increase in property operating expenses was primarily due to higher repairs and maintenance costs and higher labor costs.\nGround Rent Expenses\nThe ground rent expense was consistent with 2017.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased equity compensation expense.\nObservatory Expenses\nThe increase in Observatory expenses was primarily due to higher payroll costs of $0.8 million, higher technology costs of $0.7 million and higher marketing costs of $0.6 million.\nReal Estate Taxes\nThe increase in real estate taxes was primarily attributable to higher assessed values for multiple properties.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to depreciation of assets newly placed in service together with the accelerated depreciation of retired assets, partially offset by lower amortization of purchase accounting deferred leasing costs associated with 2013 and 2014 acquisitions as these costs become fully amortized.\nInterest Income\nInterest income increased primarily due to higher interest rates on cash balances and short-term investments.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased due to higher outstanding principal balances.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt\nThere was no loss on early extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nLoss from Derivative Financial Instruments\nThere was no loss from derivative financial instruments for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nThe decrease in income tax expense was primarily attributable to a reduction in the federal corporate tax rate.\nPrivate Perpetual Preferred Unit Distributions\nThe private perpetual preferred unit distributions were consistent with 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund and maintain our assets and operations, including lease-up costs, fund our redevelopment and repositioning programs, acquire properties, make distributions to our securityholders and other general business needs. Based on the historical experience of our management and our business strategy, in the foreseeable future we anticipate we will generate positive cash flows from operations. In order for ESRT to qualify as a REIT, ESRT is required under the Code to distribute to its securityholders, on an annual basis, at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains. We expect to make quarterly distributions to our securityholders.\nWhile we may be able to anticipate and plan for certain liquidity needs, there may be unexpected increases in uses of cash that are beyond our control and which would affect our financial condition and results of operations. For example, we may be required to comply with new laws or regulations that cause us to incur unanticipated capital expenditures for our properties, thereby increasing our liquidity needs. Even if there are no material changes to our anticipated liquidity requirements, our sources of liquidity may be fewer than, and the funds available from such sources may be less than, anticipated or needed. Our primary sources of liquidity will generally consist of cash on hand, short term investments, cash generated from our operating activities, debt issuances and unused borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements, including distributions, operating expenses, working capital, debt service, and capital expenditures from cash flows from operations, cash and short-term investments, debt issuances, and available borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility. The availability of these borrowings is subject to the conditions set forth in the applicable loan agreements. We expect to meet our long-term capital requirements, including acquisitions, redevelopments and capital expenditures through our cash flows from operations, cash on hand, short term investments, our unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility, mortgage financings, debt issuances, common and/or preferred equity issuances and asset sales. Our properties require periodic investments of capital for individual lease related tenant improvements allowances, general capital improvements and costs associated with capital expenditures. Our overall leverage will depend on our mix of investments and the cost of leverage. ESRT's charter does not restrict the amount of leverage that we may use.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had approximately $233.9 million available in cash and cash equivalents and there was $1.1 billion available under our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nThrough August 2021, QIA will have a right of first offer to co-invest with us as a joint venture partner in real estate investment opportunities initiated by us where we have elected, at our discretion, to seek out a joint venture partner in real estate investment opportunities. The right of first offer period will be extended for 30 months so long as at least one joint venture transaction is consummated by us and QIA during the initial term, and will be extended for a further 30-month term if at least one more joint venture transaction is consummated during such initial extension period.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $1.7 billion of total consolidated indebtedness outstanding, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.03% and a weighted average maturity of 8.3 years. As of December 31, 2019, exclusive of\nprincipal amortization, we have approximately $265.0 million of debt maturing in 2022. Our consolidated net debt to total market capitalization was approximately 25.2% as of December 31, 2019.\nUnsecured Revolving Credit and Term Loan Facility\nAmount. The unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility is comprised of a $1.1 billion revolving credit facility and a $265 million term loan facility. The new revolving facility replaced our existing credit facility which was due to mature in January 2019 and was undrawn at the time of the amendment. The term loan facility was borrowed in full at closing and used to repay an existing $265 million term loan. The unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility contains an accordion feature that would allow us to increase the maximum aggregate principal amount to $1.75 billion under specified circumstances.\nGuarantors. Certain of our subsidiaries are guarantors of our obligations under the unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility.\nInterest. Amounts outstanding under the (a) term loan facility bear interest at a floating rate equal to, at our election, (x) the Eurodollar rate, plus a spread that we expect will range from 0.900% to 1.800% depending upon our leverage ratio and credit rating, or (y) a base rate, plus a spread that we expect will range from 0.000% to 0.800% depending upon our leverage ratio and credit rating and (b) revolving credit facility bear interest at a floating rate equal to, at our election, (x) the Eurodollar rate, plus a spread that we expect will range from 0.825% to 1.550% depending upon our leverage ratio and credit rating or (y) a base rate, plus a spread that we expect will range from 0.000% to 0.550% depending upon our leverage ratio and credit rating.\nMaturity. The initial maturity of the unsecured revolving credit facility is August 2021. We have the option to extend the initial term for up to two additional six-month periods, subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.0625% and 0.075% of the then outstanding commitments under the unsecured revolving credit facility on the first and the second extensions, respectively. The term loan facility matures in August 2022.\nFinancial Covenants. The unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility includes the following financial covenants: (i) maximum leverage ratio of total indebtedness to total asset value (as defined in the agreement) of the loan parties and their consolidated subsidiaries will not exceed 60%, (ii) consolidated secured indebtedness will not exceed 40% of total asset value, (iii) tangible net worth will not be less than $1.2 billion plus 75% of net equity proceeds received by the Operating Partnership (other than proceeds received within ninety days after the redemption, retirement or repurchase of ownership or equity interests in the Operating Partnership up to the amount paid by the Operating Partnership in connection with such redemption, retirement or repurchase, where, the net effect is that the Operating Partnership shall not have increased its net worth as a result of any such proceeds), (iv) adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the unsecured revolving credit facility) to consolidated fixed charges will not be less than 1.50x, (v) the aggregate net operating income with respect to all unencumbered eligible properties to the portion of interest expense attributable to unsecured indebtedness will not be less than 1.75x, and (vi) the ratio of total unsecured indebtedness to unencumbered asset value will not exceed 60%.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the covenants, as described below (dollars in thousands):\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial Covenant\n</td> <td>Required\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>In Compliance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maximum total leverage\n</td> <td>< 60%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>Yes\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maximum secured debt\n</td> <td>< 40%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>Yes\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum fixed charge coverage\n</td> <td>> 1.50x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Yes\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum unencumbered interest coverage\n</td> <td>> 1.75x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Yes\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maximum unsecured leverage\n</td> <td>< 60%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>Yes\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum tangible net worth\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,252,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,862,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Yes\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Covenants. The unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility contains customary covenants, including limitations on liens, investment, debt, fundamental changes, and transactions with affiliates, and requires certain customary financial reports.\nEvents of Default. The unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility contains customary events of default (subject in certain cases to specified cure periods), including but not limited to non-payment, breach of covenants, representations or warranties, cross defaults, bankruptcy or other insolvency events, judgments, ERISA events, invalidity of loan documents, loss\nof real estate investment trust qualification, and occurrence of a change of control (defined in the definitive documentation for the unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility).\nExchangeable Senior Notes\nDuring August 2019, we settled the $250.0 million principal amount of the 2.625% Exchangeable Senior Notes in cash. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nSeries A, B, C, D, E and F Senior Notes (collectively, \"Senior Unsecured Notes\") are senior unsecured obligations with an aggregate principal amount of $800.0 million maturing on various dates from 2025 to 2033. These Senior Unsecured Notes are unconditionally guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries that guarantees indebtedness under the unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility. Interest on the Senior Unsecured Notes is payable quarterly.\nThe terms of the Senior Unsecured Notes include customary covenants, including limitations on liens, investment, debt, fundamental changes, and transactions with affiliates and require certain customary financial reports. The Senior Unsecured Notes also require compliance with financial ratios including a maximum leverage ratio, a maximum secured leverage ratio, a minimum amount of tangible net worth, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a minimum unencumbered interest coverage ratio, and a maximum unsecured leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the covenants under the outstanding Senior Unsecured Notes.\nMortgage Debt\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had mortgage notes payable, net of $605.5 million. The first maturity is in 2024.\nLeverage Policies\nWe expect to employ leverage in our capital structure in amounts determined from time to time by our board of directors. Although ESRT's board of directors has not adopted a policy that limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur, we anticipate that ESRT's board of directors will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from time to time, as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be either fixed or floating rate. ESRT's charter and bylaws do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that we may incur nor do they restrict the form in which our indebtedness will be taken (including, but not limited to, recourse or non-recourse debt and cross collateralized debt). Our overall leverage depends on our mix of investments and the cost of leverage, however, we maintain a level of indebtedness consistent with our plan to seek an investment grade credit rating. ESRT's board of directors may from time to time modify our leverage policies in light of the then-current economic conditions, relative costs of debt and equity capital, market values of our properties, general market conditions for debt and equity securities, fluctuations in the market price of ESRT's common stock and our traded OP units, growth and acquisition opportunities and other factors.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe following tables summarize our tenant improvement costs, leasing commission costs and our capital expenditures for each of the periods presented (dollars in thousands, except per square foot amounts).\nOffice Properties(1)\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total New Leases, Expansions, and Renewals\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of leases signed(2)\n</td> <td>152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>155\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total square feet\n</td> <td>1,216,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>991,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,198,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing commission costs(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant improvement costs(3)\n</td> <td>70,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total leasing commissions and tenant improvement costs(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing commission costs per square foot(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.06\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant improvement costs per square foot(3)\n</td> <td>58.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70.48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total leasing commissions and tenant improvement costs per square foot(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75.55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88.37\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRetail Properties(4)\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total New Leases, Expansions, and Renewals\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of leases signed(2)\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Square Feet\n</td> <td>87,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing commission costs(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant improvement costs(3)\n</td> <td>3,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total leasing commissions and tenant improvement costs(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing commission costs per square foot(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27.08\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46.33\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant improvement costs per square foot(3)\n</td> <td>38.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.35\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total leasing commissions and tenant improvement costs per square foot(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78.91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72.79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77.68\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Excludes an aggregate of 511,984, 513,606 and 507,395 rentable square feet of retail space in our Manhattan office properties in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

In addition, it will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it distributes less than 100% of its net taxable income (including net capital gains) and will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which its distributions in any calendar year are less than a minimum amount specified under U.S. federal income tax laws. We intend to distribute our net taxable income to our securityholders in a manner intended to allow ESRT to satisfy its REIT 90% distribution requirement and to allow ESRT to avoid U.S. federal income tax liability on its income and the 4% nondeductible excise tax.\nBefore we pay any distribution, we must first meet both our operating requirements and obligations to make payments of principal and interest, if any. However, under some circumstances, we may be required to use cash reserves, incur debt or liquidate assets at rates or times that we regard as unfavorable in order to allow ESRT to satisfy its REIT 90% distribution requirement and to avoid U.S. federal income tax and the 4% nondeductible excise tax in that year.\nDistribution to Equity Holders\nDistributions and dividends have been made to equity holders in 2017, 2018 and 2019 as follows (amounts in thousands):\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>126,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>126,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>127,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nStock and Publicly Traded Operating Partnership Unit Repurchase Program\nOur Board of Directors reauthorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of ESRT's Class A common stock and our Series ES, Series 250 and Series 60 operating partnership units through December 31, 2020.\nUnder the program, we may purchase ESRT's Class A common stock and our Series ES, Series 250 and Series 60 operating partnership units in accordance with applicable securities laws from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases will be determined by us at our discretion and will be subject to stock price, availability, trading volume and general market conditions. The authorization does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of securities, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at our discretion without prior notice.\nPrivate Perpetual Preferred Units\nDuring December 2019, we completed an exchange offer whereby we issued 4,610,383 new Series 2019 Private Perpetual Preferred Units in exchange for 4,610,383 OP units, consisting of 1,632,667 Series ES OP Units, 186,799 Series 250 OP Units, 302,608 Series 60 OP Units and 2,488,309 Series PR OP Units. The OP units acquired in the exchange offer were retired upon receipt. The Series 2019 Private Perpetual Preferred Units were issued in the exchange offer in reliance on the exemption set forth in Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, for securities exchanged by an issuer with its existing security holders exclusively where no commission or other remuneration is paid or given directly or indirectly for soliciting such exchange.\nThe Series 2019 Private Perpetual Preferred Units have a liquidation preference of $13.52 per unit and are entitled to receive cumulative preferential annual cash distributions of $0.70 per unit payable in arrears on a quarterly basis. The Series 2019 Private Perpetual Preferred Units are not redeemable at the option of the holders and are redeemable at our option only in the case of specific defined events.\nCash Flows\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2019 to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nNet cash. Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash were $271.6 million and $270.8 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the maturity of investments in short-term time deposits was largely offset by capital improvements and expenditures and the repayment of our exchangeable unsecured senior notes resulting in approximately the same balances for cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash at the end of 2019 when compared to 2018.\nOperating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $46.5 million to $232.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $279.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily attributable to the return of security deposits to various tenants and to the settlement of a derivative contract.\nInvesting activities. Net cash provided by investing activities increased by $792.7 million to $149.7 million provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $643.0 million net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 due to proceeds from maturing short-term time deposits, partially offset by increased expenditures for additions to building and improvements in the year ended December 31, 2019.\nFinancing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities decreased by $486.1 million to $381.5 million used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $104.6 million provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 due to the repayment of our exchangeable unsecured senior notes in 2019. Additionally, the net proceeds from issuance of debt was higher in 2018 compared to 2019.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2018 to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nNet cash. Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash were $270.8 million and $530.2 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to investments in short-term time deposits and capital\nimprovements and expenditures offset by net proceeds from the issuance of debt during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOperating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $84.8 million to $279.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $194.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 mainly attributable to payments of operating liabilities that occurred in 2017 which were absent in 2018. 2017 included a payment of an amount owed to the estate of Leona M. Helmsley, as required under our formation agreements, equal to the New York City transfer taxes which would have been payable by us in absence of the estate's exemption from such tax. This amount had been accrued as a liability at our formation in October 2013 and became payable upon the taxing authority's final approval of such exemption in September 2017, so the reduction in our liabilities matched the reduction in our cash.\nInvesting activities. Net cash used in investing activities increased by $420.0 million to $643.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $223.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to investments in short-term time deposits made during 2018.\nFinancing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities increased by $161.5 million to $104.6 million provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $56.9 million used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net proceeds from issuance of debt was higher in 2018 compared to 2017.\nNet Operating Income\nOur financial reports include a discussion of property net operating income, or NOI. NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. NOI is used by our management to evaluate and compare the performance of our properties and to determine trends in earnings and to compute the fair value of our properties as it is not affected by: (i) the cost of funds of the property owner, (ii) the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets that are included in net income computed in accordance with GAAP, (iii) acquisition expenses, loss on early extinguishment of debt and loss from derivative financial instruments, or (iv) general and administrative expenses and other gains and losses that are specific to the property owner. The cost of funds is eliminated from NOI because it is specific to the particular financing capabilities and constraints of the owner. The cost of funds is eliminated because it is dependent on historical interest rates and other costs of capital as well as past decisions made by us regarding the appropriate mix of capital which may have changed or may change in the future. Depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets are eliminated because they may not accurately represent the actual change in value in our office or retail properties that result from use of the properties or changes in market conditions. While certain aspects of real property do decline in value over time in a manner that is reasonably captured by depreciation and amortization, the value of the properties as a whole have historically increased or decreased as a result of changes in overall economic conditions\ninstead of from actual use of the property or the passage of time. Gains and losses from the sale of real property vary from property to property and are affected by market conditions at the time of sale which will usually change from period to period. These gains and losses can create distortions when comparing one period to another or when comparing our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies that have not made similarly-timed purchases or sales. We believe that eliminating these costs from net income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue, generated and actual expenses incurred in operating our properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.\nHowever, the usefulness of NOI is limited because it excludes general and administrative costs, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense and gains or losses from the sale of properties, and other gains and losses as stipulated by GAAP, the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which are significant economic costs. NOI may fail to capture significant trends in these components of net income which further limits its usefulness.\nNOI is a measure of the operating performance of our properties but does not measure our performance as a whole. NOI is therefore not a substitute for net income as computed in accordance with GAAP. This measure should be analyzed in conjunction with net income computed in accordance with GAAP and discussions elsewhere in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations regarding the components of net income that are eliminated in the calculation of NOI. Other companies may use different methods for calculating NOI or similarly titled measures and, accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies that do not define the measure exactly as we do.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of our net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to NOI for the periods presented (amounts in thousands):\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>117,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>61,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>181,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>168,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>160,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>79,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on early extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from derivative financial instruments\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>289\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>2,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>(11,259\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,661\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,942\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third-party management and other fees\n</td> <td>(1,254\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,440\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,400\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>396,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>410,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>402,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Net Operating Income Data\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Straight line rental revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in rental revenue from the amortization of above and below-market lease assets and liabilities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of acquired below-market ground leases\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFunds from Operations (\"FFO\")\nWe present below a discussion of FFO. We compute FFO in accordance with the White Paper\u201d on FFO published by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, which defines FFO as net income (loss) (determined in accordance with GAAP), excluding impairment writedowns of investments in depreciable real estate and investments in in-substance real estate investments, gains or losses from debt restructurings and sales of depreciable operating properties, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), less distributions to non-controlling interests and gains/losses from discontinued operations and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is a widely recognized non-GAAP financial measure for REITs that we believe, when considered with financial statements determined in accordance with GAAP, is useful to investors in\nunderstanding financial performance and providing a relevant basis for comparison among REITS. In addition, FFO is useful to investors as it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate has generally appreciated over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciable assets. Investors should review FFO, along with GAAP net income, when trying to understand an equity REIT's operating performance. We present FFO because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our results of operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of performance is limited. There can be no assurance that FFO presented by us is comparable to similarly titled measures of other REITs. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. FFO is not indicative of cash available to fund ongoing cash needs, including the ability to make cash distributions. Although FFO is a measure used for comparability in assessing the performance of REITs, as the NAREIT White Paper only provides guidelines for computing FFO, the computation of FFO may vary from one company to another.\nModified Funds From Operations (\"Modified FFO\")\nModified FFO adds back an adjustment for any above or below-market ground lease amortization to traditionally defined FFO. We consider this a useful supplemental measure in evaluating our operating performance due to the non-cash accounting treatment under GAAP, which stems from the third quarter 2014 acquisition of two option properties following our formation transactions as they carry significantly below market ground leases, the amortization of which is material to our overall results. We present Modified FFO because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance in that it adds back the non-cash amortization of below-market ground leases. There can be no assurance that Modified FFO presented by us is comparable to similarly titled measures of other REITs. Modified FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. Modified FFO is not indicative of cash available to fund ongoing cash needs, including the ability to make cash distributions.\nCore Funds From Operations (\"Core FFO\")\nCore FFO adds back to traditionally defined FFO the following items: acquisition expenses, severance expenses, retirement equity compensation expenses, private perpetual preferred exchange offering expenses, deferred tax asset write-off, loss on early extinguishment of debt, acquisition expenses, gain on settlement of lawsuit related to the Observatory, net of income taxes, ground lease amortization, construction severance expenses and acquisition break-up fee. The Company presents Core FFO because it considers it an important supplemental measure of its operating performance in that it excludes items associated with its IPO and formation transactions and other non-recurring items. There can be no assurance that Core FFO presented by the Company is comparable to similarly titled measures of other REITs. Core FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. Core FFO is not indicative of cash available to fund ongoing cash needs, including the ability to make cash distributions. In future periods, we may also exclude other items from Core FFO that we believe may help investors compare our results.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to FFO, Modified FFO and Core FFO for the periods presented (amounts in thousands):\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>117,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Private perpetual preferred unit distributions\n</td> <td>(1,743\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(936\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(936\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>177,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>166,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>159,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds from operations attributable to common stockholders and non-controlled interests\n</td> <td>260,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>282,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>276,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of below-market ground leases\n</td> <td>7,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Modified funds from operations attributable to common stockholders and non-controlled interests\n</td> <td>267,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>290,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>284,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred tax asset write-off\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on early extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core funds from operations attributable to common stockholders and non-controlled interests\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>267,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>290,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>286,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average Operating Partnership units\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic\n</td> <td>297,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>297,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>296,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted\n</td> <td>297,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>297,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>298,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFactors That May Influence Future Results of Operations\nRental Revenue\nWe derive revenues primarily from rents, rent escalations, expense reimbursements and other income received from tenants under existing leases at each of our properties. Escalations and expense reimbursements\u201d consist of payments made by tenants to us under contractual lease obligations to reimburse a portion of the property operating expenses and real estate taxes incurred at each property.\nWe believe that the average rental rates for in-place leases at our properties are generally below the current market rates, although individual leases at particular properties presently may be leased above, at or below the current market rates within its particular submarket.\nThe amount of net rental income and reimbursements that we receive depends principally on our ability to lease currently available space, re-lease space to new tenants upon the scheduled or unscheduled termination of leases or renew expiring leases and to maintain or increase our rental rates. Factors that could affect our rental incomes include, but are not limited to: local, regional or national economic conditions; an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, office or retail space; changes in market rental rates; our ability to provide adequate services and maintenance at our properties; and fluctuations in interest rates, all of which could adversely affect our rental income in future periods. Future economic or regional downturns affecting our submarkets, or downturns in our tenants' industries, could impair our ability to lease vacant space and renew or re-lease space as well as the ability of our tenants to fulfill their lease commitments, and could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase the occupancy at our properties.\nTenant Credit Risk\nThe economic condition of our tenants may also deteriorate, which could negatively impact their ability to fulfill their lease commitments and in turn adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase the occupancy level and/or rental rates of our properties. Potential tenants may look to consolidate, reduce overhead and preserve operating capital and may also defer strategic decisions, including entering into new, long-term leases at properties.\nLeasing\nWe signed 1.3 million, 1.0 million, and 1.3 million rentable square feet of new leases, expansions and lease renewals, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nDue to the relatively small number of leases that are signed in any particular quarter, one or more larger leases may have a disproportionately positive or negative impact on average rent, tenant improvement and leasing commission costs for\nthat period. As a result, we believe it is more appropriate when analyzing trends in average rent and tenant improvement and leasing commission costs to review activity over multiple quarters or years. Tenant improvement costs include expenditures for general improvements occurring concurrently with, but that are not directly related to, the cost of installing a new tenant. Leasing commission costs are similarly subject to significant fluctuations depending upon the length of leases being signed and the mix of tenants from quarter to quarter.\nAs of December 31, 2019, there were approximately 0.9 million rentable square feet of space in our portfolio available to lease (excluding leases signed but not yet commenced) representing 8.8% of the net rentable square footage of the properties in our portfolio. In addition, leases representing 7.6% and 6.5% of net rentable square footage of the properties in our portfolio will expire in 2020 and in 2021, respectively. These leases are expected to represent approximately 8.1% and 6.9%, respectively, of our annualized rent for such periods. Our revenues and results of operations can be impacted by expiring leases that are not renewed or re-leased or that are renewed or re-leased at base rental rates equal to, above or below the current average base rental rates. Further, our revenues and results of operations can also be affected by the costs we incur to re-lease available space, including payment of leasing commissions, redevelopments and build-to-suit remodeling that may not be borne by the tenant.\nWe believe that as we complete the redevelopment and repositioning of our properties we will, over the long-term, experience increased occupancy levels and rents. Over the short term, as we renovate and reposition our properties, which includes aggregating smaller spaces to offer large blocks of space, we may experience lower occupancy levels as a result of having to relocate tenants to alternative space and the strategic expiration of existing leases. We believe that despite the short-term lower occupancy levels we may experience, we will continue to experience increased rental revenues as a result of the increased rents which we expect to obtain in following the redevelopment and repositioning of our properties.\nMarket Conditions\nThe properties in our portfolio are located in Manhattan and the greater New York metropolitan area, which includes Fairfield County, Connecticut and Westchester County, New York. Positive or negative changes in conditions in these markets, such as business hirings or layoffs or downsizing, industry growth or slowdowns, relocations of businesses, increases or decreases in real estate and other taxes, costs of complying with governmental regulations or changed regulation, can impact our overall performance.\nObservatory and Broadcasting Operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the Empire State Building Observatory hosted 3,505,000 visitors, compared to 3,805,000 visitors for the same period in 2018, a decrease of 7.9%. Observatory revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $128.8 million, a 1.9% decrease from $131.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Observatory revenue decline was driven by the closure of the 102nd floor observation deck as part of the Observatory upgrade program and a visitation decline, partially offset by improved pricing. In the year ended December 31, 2019, there were 73 bad weather days, compared to 56 bad weather days in the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe elevator servicing the 102nd floor Observatory was closed to visitors during the first quarter of 2018 for the planned replacement of the original machinery and a new, higher speed glass elevator. The 102nd floor Observatory was closed for approximately nine months in 2019 and opened on October 12, 2019. The work on the 80th floor component of our Observatory upgrade program has also been completed and the 80th floor opened in November 2019. The overall Observatory upgrade program is now complete.\nObservatory revenues and admissions are dependent upon the following: (i) the number of tourists (domestic and international) that come to New York City and visit the observatory, as well as any related tourism trends; (ii) the prices per admission that can be charged; (iii) seasonal trends affecting the number of visitors to the observatory; (iv) competition, in particular from other new and existing observatories; and (v) weather trends.\nWe license the use of the Empire State Building mast to third party television and radio broadcasters and providers of data communications. We also lease space in the upper floors of the building to such licensees to house their transmission equipment and related facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we derived $13.5 million of revenue and $3.3 million of expense reimbursements from the Empire State Building's broadcasting licenses and related leases.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses generally consist of depreciation and amortization, real estate taxes, ground lease expenses, repairs and maintenance, security, utilities, property-related payroll, and insurance. Factors that may affect our ability to control\nthese operating costs include: increases in insurance premiums, tax rates, the cost of periodic repair, redevelopment costs and the cost of re-leasing space, the cost of compliance with governmental regulation, including zoning and tax laws, the potential for liability under applicable laws and interest rate levels. If our operating costs increase as a result of any of the foregoing factors, our future cash flow and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe expenses of owning and operating a property are not necessarily reduced when circumstances, such as market factors and competition, cause a reduction in income from the property. If revenues drop, we may not be able to reduce our expenses accordingly. Costs associated with real estate investments, such as real estate taxes and maintenance generally, will not be materially reduced even if a property is not fully occupied or other circumstances cause our revenues to decrease. As a result, if revenues decrease in the future, static operating costs may adversely affect our future cash flow and results of operations. If similar economic conditions exist in the future, we may experience future losses.\nCost of Funds and Interest Rates\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had no variable rate debt outstanding as the LIBOR rate on our unsecured term loan facility of $265.0 million was fixed at 2.1485% under a variable to fixed interest rate swap agreement. Our variable rate debt may increase to the extent we use available borrowing capacity from our unsecured credit facility to fund capital improvements.\nCompetition\nThe leasing of real estate is highly competitive in Manhattan and the greater New York metropolitan market in which we operate. We compete with numerous acquirers, developers, owners and operators of commercial real estate, many of which own or may seek to acquire or develop properties similar to ours in the same markets in which our properties are located. The principal means of competition are rent charged, location, services provided and the nature and condition of the facility to be leased. In addition, we face competition from other real estate companies including other REITs, private real estate funds, domestic and foreign financial institutions, life insurance companies, pension trusts, partnerships, individual investors and others that may have greater financial resources or access to capital than we do or that are willing to acquire properties in transactions which are more highly leveraged or are less attractive from a financial viewpoint than we are willing to pursue. In addition, competition from new and existing observatories and/or broadcasting operations could have a negative impact on revenues from our observatory and/or broadcasting operations. Adverse impacts on domestic travel and changes in foreign currency exchange rates may also decrease demand in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If our competitors offer space at rental rates below current market rates, below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants, in better locations within our markets or in higher quality facilities, we may lose potential tenants and may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge in order to retain tenants when our tenants' leases expire.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and with the rules and regulations of the SEC represent our assets and liabilities and operating results. The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and our wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. For purposes of comparison, certain items shown in the 2017 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation used for 2018 and 2019.\nWe consolidate entities in which we have a controlling financial interest. In determining whether we have a controlling financial interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, we consider factors such as ownership interest, board representation, management representation, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners/members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity ( VIE\u201d) and we are the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the entity that has (i) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. The primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the VIE. We had no VIEs as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nWe will assess the accounting treatment for each investment we may have in the future. This assessment will include a review of each entity's organizational agreement to determine which party has what rights and whether those rights are protective or participating. For all VIEs, we will review such agreements in order to determine which party has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and benefit. In situations where we or our partner could approve, among other things, the annual budget, or leases that cover more than a nominal amount of space relative to the total rentable space at each property, we would not consolidate the investment as we consider these to be\nsubstantive participation rights that result in shared power of the activities that would most significantly impact the performance and benefit of such joint venture investment.\nA non-controlling interest in a consolidated subsidiary is defined as the portion of the equity (net assets) in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. Non-controlling interests are required to be presented as a separate component of equity in the consolidated balance sheets and in the consolidated statements of income by requiring earnings and other comprehensive income to be attributed to controlling and non-controlling interests.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount, including goodwill, exceeds the reporting unit's fair value and the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount of that goodwill. Non-amortizing intangible assets, such as trade names and trademarks, are subject to an annual impairment test based on fair value and amortizing intangible assets are tested whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nWe performed an annual review of goodwill for impairment and concluded there was no impairment of goodwill. Our methodology to review goodwill impairment, which includes a significant amount of judgment and estimates, provides a reasonable basis to determine whether impairment has occurred. However, many of the factors employed in determining whether or not goodwill is impaired are outside of our control and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates will change in future periods.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are generally not subject to federal and state income taxes as our taxable income or loss is reportable by our partners. Accordingly, no provision has been made for federal and state income taxes. ESRT elected, together with ESRT Observatory TRS, L.L.C., our subsidiary which holds our observatory operations, to treat ESRT Observatory TRS, L.L.C. as a TRS, and ESRT has elected, together with ESRT Holdings TRS, L.L.C., our subsidiary that holds our third party management, construction (through cessation of our construction business in the first quarter of 2015), restaurant, cafeteria, health clubs and certain cleaning operations, to treat ESRT Holdings TRS, L.L.C. as a TRS. TRS's may participate in non-real estate activities and/or perform non-customary services for tenants and their operations are generally subject to regular corporate income taxes. Each of our TRS's account for their income taxes in accordance with GAAP, which includes an estimate of the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. The calculation of the TRS's tax provisions may require interpreting tax laws and regulations and could result in the use of judgments or estimates which could cause its recorded tax liability to differ from the actual amount due. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The TRS's periodically assess the realizability of deferred tax assets and the adequacy of deferred tax liabilities, including the results of local, state, or federal tax audits or estimates and judgments used.\nWe apply provisions for measuring and recognizing tax benefits associated with uncertain income tax positions. Penalties and interest, if incurred, would be recorded as a component of income tax expense. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we do not have a liability for uncertain tax positions. As of December 31, 2019, the tax years ended December 31, 2016 through December 31, 2019 remain open for an audit by the Internal Revenue Service, state or local authorities.\nShare-Based Compensation\nShare-based compensation for market based equity awards is measured at the fair value of the award on the date of grant and recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the stated vesting period, which is generally three or four years, depending on retirement eligibility. Share-based compensation for time-based equity awards is measured at the fair value of the award on the date of grant and recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the shorter of (i) the stated vesting period, which is generally three or four years, or (ii) the period from the date of grant to the date the employee becomes retirement eligible, which may occur upon grant. The determination of fair value of these awards is subjective and involves significant estimates and assumptions including expected volatility of ESRT stock, expected dividend yield, expected term, and assumptions of whether these awards will achieve parity with other operating partnership units or achieve performance thresholds. We believe that the assumptions and estimates utilized are appropriate based on the information available to management at the time of grant.\nSegment Reporting\nWe have identified two reportable segments: (1) real estate and (2) observatory. Our real estate segment includes all activities related to the ownership, management, operation, acquisition, repositioning and disposition of our real estate assets. Our observatory segment operates the 86th and 102nd floor observatories at the Empire State Building. These two lines of businesses are managed separately because each business requires different support infrastructures, provides different services and has dissimilar economic characteristics such as investments needed, stream of revenues and different marketing strategies. We account for intersegment sales and transfers as if the sales or transfers were to third parties, that is, at current market prices.\nFor more information about our segments, refer to Financial Statements-Note 12-Segment Reporting\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAccounting Standards Update\nReference is made to Note 2 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information about recently issued and recently adopted accounting standards.", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I am unable to comprehend the table you have provided since it appears to be incomplete.\n- I am unable to understand the table since critical pieces of information are absent.

Net operating income for the year ended December 31, 2019, decreased by 3.5% to $95.0 million from $98.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. As a reminder, the 102nd floor observation deck was closed for approximately nine months in 2019 and reopened on October 12, 2019. \n \u2022 Declared and paid aggregate dividends of $0.42 per share during 2019.  As of December 31, 2019, our total portfolio contained 10.1 million rentable square feet of office and retail space. We owned 14 office properties (including three long-term ground leasehold interests) encompassing approximately 9.4 million rentable square feet of office space. Nine of these properties are located in the midtown Manhattan market and aggregate approximately 7.6 million rentable square feet of office space, including the Empire State Building. Our Manhattan office properties also contain an aggregate of 511,984 rentable square feet of premier retail space on their ground floor and/or contiguous levels. Our remaining five office properties are located in Fairfield County, Connecticut and Westchester County, New York, encompassing in the aggregate approximately 1.8 million rentable square feet. The majority of square footage for\nthese five properties is located in densely populated metropolitan communities with immediate access to mass transportation. Additionally, we have entitled land at the Stamford Transportation Center in Stamford, Connecticut, adjacent to one of our office properties, that will support the development of an approximately 415,000 rentable square foot office building and garage, which we refer to herein as Metro Tower. As of December 31, 2019, our portfolio included four standalone retail properties located in Manhattan and two standalone retail properties located in the city center of Westport, Connecticut, encompassing 205,595 rentable square feet in the aggregate.\nThe Empire State Building is our flagship property. The Empire State Building provides us with a diverse source of revenue through its office and retail leases, observatory operations, and broadcasting licenses and related leased space. Our observatory operations are a separate reporting segment. Our observatory operations are subject to regular patterns of tourist activity in Manhattan. During the past ten years, approximately 16% to 18% of our annual observatory revenue was realized in the first quarter, 26.0% to 28.0% was realized in the second quarter, 31.0% to 33.0% was realized in the third quarter, and 23.0% to 25.0% was realized in the fourth quarter.\nThe components of the Empire State Building revenue are as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\nWe have been undertaking a comprehensive redevelopment and repositioning strategy of our Manhattan office properties. This strategy is designed to improve the overall value and attractiveness of our properties and has contributed significantly to our tenant repositioning efforts, which seek to increase our occupancy, raise our rental rates, increase our rentable square feet, increase our aggregate rental revenue, lengthen our average lease term, increase our average lease size, and improve our tenant credit quality. These improvements include restored, renovated and upgraded or new lobbies, elevator modernization, renovated public areas and bathrooms, refurbished or new windows, upgrade and standardization of retail storefront and signage, fa\u00e7ade restorations, modernization of building-wide systems, and enhanced tenant amenities. We have also aggregated smaller spaces in order to offer larger blocks of office space, including multiple floors, that are attractive to larger, higher credit-quality tenants as well as to offer new, pre-built suites with improved layouts. This strategy has shown what we believe to be attractive results to date, and we believe has the potential to improve our operating margins and cash flows in the future. We believe we will continue to enhance our tenant base and improve rents as our pre-redevelopment leases continue to expire and be re-leased. From 2002 through December 31, 2019, we have invested a total of approximately $918.6 million (excluding tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions) in our Manhattan office properties pursuant to this program. We intend to fund these capital improvements through a combination of operating cash flow, cash on hand, short term investments and borrowings.\nDuring the second quarter 2017, we commenced a multi-year capital project at the Empire State Building, which we completed during the fourth quarter 2019, that we believe improves the convenience for office tenants and their visitors, increases the value of our 34th Street facing retail space, enhances the Observatory visitor experience, and increases Observatory revenue per capita.\nIn the first phase completed in August 2018, we relocated the Observatory entrance, previously located on Fifth Avenue, to a new, larger, dedicated entrance for Observatory visitors at the western side of the Empire State Building on 34th Street. The new entrance eliminates Observatory visitor flow into the Fifth Avenue lobby and streamlines the visitor exit from that lobby, thereby reducing Observatory traffic in the lobby by more than 50% and improving Fifth Avenue access for our office tenants and their visitors.\nDuring the third quarter 2019 we opened the second phase of the project, the new second floor galleries and in the fourth quarter 2019 we completed the final phase, the redevelopment of the 80th floor and opened the newly renovated 102nd floor observatory.\nThe elevator servicing the 102nd floor Observatory was closed to visitors during the first quarter of 2018 for planned replacement of the original machinery and a new glass cab for the elevator which serves it. The 102nd floor Observatory was closed for approximately nine months in 2019 and opened on October 12, 2019. Revenue for the 102nd floor observatory was $3.6 million, $8.6 million and $11.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, The decrease in revenue is primarily related to the closures.\nWe have now completed all phases of this project. Expenditures for the improvement project, which began during the second quarter 2017, were $155.4 million through December 31, 2019. This investment is an example of continually looking at ways to innovate and enhance the office and retail tenant and visitor experience at the Empire State Building.\nThe Greater New York metropolitan area office market is soft, and we compete with properties that have been redeveloped recently or have planned redevelopment. We expect to spend approximately $40.0 million through 2020 on our well-maintained and well-located properties' common areas and amenities to enhance competitiveness and protect our market position. Expenditures, which began during the second quarter 2018, were $29.0 million through December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2019, excluding principal amortization, we had approximately $265.0 million of debt maturing in 2022, and we had total debt outstanding of approximately $1.7 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.03% (excluding premiums and discount) and a weighted average maturity of 8.3 years and 100.0% of which is fixed-rate indebtedness. As of December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $233.9 million. Our consolidated net debt to total market capitalization was approximately 25.2% as of December 31, 2019.\nResults of Operations\nOverview\nThe discussion below relates to the financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nThe following table summarizes the historical results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (amounts in thousands):\n\nRental Revenue and Tenant Expense Reimbursement\nWe adopted FASB Topic 842 using the modified retrospective approach as of January 1, 2019 and elected to apply the\ntransition provisions of the standard at adoption. As such, the prior period amounts presented under ASC 840 were not restated\nto conform with the 2019 presentation. We adopted the practical expedient in Topic 842, which allowed us to avoid separating\nlease and non-lease rental income. Consequently, all rental income earned pursuant to tenant leases in 2019 is reflected as one\ncategory, Rental Revenue,\u201d in the 2019 consolidated statement of income. The following table reflects the components of\n2019 rental revenue: \nWe believe the preceding table of the components of rental revenue is not, and is not intended to be, a presentation in\naccordance with GAAP. It is provided here based on our understanding that such information is frequently used by management, investors, securities analysts and other interested parties to evaluate our performance.\nThe increase in base rent revenue was attributable to increased rental rates, partially offset by decreased broadcasting licenses and holdover rent.\nThe increase in billed tenant expense reimbursement was primarily due to reimbursements related to higher property\noperating expenses.\nObservatory Revenue\nObservatory revenues were lower primarily driven by the closure of the 102nd floor observation deck for approximately nine months in 2019 as part of the Observatory upgrade program and visitor decline, partially offset by improved pricing.\nLease Termination Fees\nThe year ended December 31, 2018 included significantly higher lease termination fees, from a combination of broadcast and office tenants, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThird-Party Management and Other Fees\nThe decrease reflects lower management fee income due to fewer assets under management.\nOther Revenues and Fees\nThe decrease in other revenues and fees is primarily due to a $2.8 million settlement with a former broadcast tenant recognized in the year ended December 31, 2018 partially offset by a property tax refund received in the year ended December 31, 2019.\nProperty Operating Expenses\nThe increase in property operating expenses was primarily due to higher repair and labor costs partially offset by lower utility costs.\nGround Rent Expenses\nThe ground rent expense was consistent with 2018.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased equity compensation expenses as well as higher leasing costs which were previously capitalized prior to our adoption of Topic 842, Lease Accounting on January 1, 2019, which requires that non-contingent leasing costs be expensed as incurred. Also contributing to the increase were costs associated with the 2019 private perpetual preferred units exchange offer.\nObservatory Expenses\nObservatory expenses increased primarily due to higher information technology consulting fees and higher marketing costs.\nReal Estate Taxes\nThe increase in real estate taxes was primarily attributable to higher assessed values for multiple properties.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe increase in depreciation and amortization was attributable to additional depreciation on assets newly placed in service during the year as well as the acceleration of depreciation of $2.0 million in connection with a partial termination agreement.\nInterest Income\nThe increase in interest income was primarily due to higher rates and the timing of short-term time deposits during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was consistent with 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nThe decrease in income tax expense was attributable to lower revenues and higher operating expenses for the Observatory segment.\nPrivate Perpetual Preferred Unit Distributions\nPrivate perpetual preferred unit distributions increased due to dividends paid on a new series of private perpetual preferred units issued by the operating partnership in December 2019 in connection with the settlement of an exchange offer for outstanding traded OP units. Holders of the new series of private perpetual preferred units are entitled to receive cumulative preferential annual cash distributions of $0.70 per units when, as and if declared by the board of directors of the company.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe following table summarizes the historical results of operations for years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (amounts in thousands):\n\nRental Revenue\nThe increase in rental income was primarily attributable to increased rental rates.\nTenant Expense Reimbursement\nThe decrease in tenant expense reimbursements was due to a reduction in broadcasting expense reimbursements.\nObservatory Revenue\nObservatory revenues were higher primarily due to an improvement in our ticket mix and higher per person average\nticket price, partially offset by the scheduled closure of the 102nd floor observation deck in the first quarter 2018 for\nreplacement of original elevator machinery.\nLease Termination Fees\nThe year ended December 31, 2018 included significantly higher lease termination fees, from a combination of broadcast and office tenants, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThird-Party Management and Other Fees\nThird-party management and other fees were consistent with 2017.\nOther Revenues and Fees\nThe increase in other revenues and fees for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to a $2.8\nmillion settlement with a former broadcast tenant.\nProperty Operating Expenses\nThe increase in property operating expenses was primarily due to higher repairs and maintenance costs and higher labor costs.\nGround Rent Expenses\nThe ground rent expense was consistent with 2017.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased equity compensation expense.\nObservatory Expenses\nThe increase in Observatory expenses was primarily due to higher payroll costs of $0.8 million, higher technology costs of $0.7 million and higher marketing costs of $0.6 million.\nReal Estate Taxes\nThe increase in real estate taxes was primarily attributable to higher assessed values for multiple properties.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to depreciation of assets newly placed in service together with the accelerated depreciation of retired assets, partially offset by lower amortization of purchase accounting deferred leasing costs associated with 2013 and 2014 acquisitions as these costs become fully amortized.\nInterest Income\nInterest income increased primarily due to higher interest rates on cash balances and short-term investments.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased due to higher outstanding principal balances.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt\nThere was no loss on early extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nLoss from Derivative Financial Instruments\nThere was no loss from derivative financial instruments for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nThe decrease in income tax expense was primarily attributable to a reduction in the federal corporate tax rate.\nPrivate Perpetual Preferred Unit Distributions\nThe private perpetual preferred unit distributions were consistent with 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund and maintain our assets and operations, including lease-up costs, fund our redevelopment and repositioning programs, acquire properties, make distributions to our securityholders and other general business needs. Based on the historical experience of our management and our business strategy, in the foreseeable future we anticipate we will generate positive cash flows from operations. In order for ESRT to qualify as a REIT, ESRT is required under the Code to distribute to its securityholders, on an annual basis, at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains. We expect to make quarterly distributions to our securityholders.\nWhile we may be able to anticipate and plan for certain liquidity needs, there may be unexpected increases in uses of cash that are beyond our control and which would affect our financial condition and results of operations. For example, we may be required to comply with new laws or regulations that cause us to incur unanticipated capital expenditures for our properties, thereby increasing our liquidity needs. Even if there are no material changes to our anticipated liquidity requirements, our sources of liquidity may be fewer than, and the funds available from such sources may be less than, anticipated or needed. Our primary sources of liquidity will generally consist of cash on hand, short term investments, cash generated from our operating activities, debt issuances and unused borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements, including distributions, operating expenses, working capital, debt service, and capital expenditures from cash flows from operations, cash and short-term investments, debt issuances, and available borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility. The availability of these borrowings is subject to the conditions set forth in the applicable loan agreements. We expect to meet our long-term capital requirements, including acquisitions, redevelopments and capital expenditures through our cash flows from operations, cash on hand, short term investments, our unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility, mortgage financings, debt issuances, common and/or preferred equity issuances and asset sales. Our properties require periodic investments of capital for individual lease related tenant improvements allowances, general capital improvements and costs associated with capital expenditures. Our overall leverage will depend on our mix of investments and the cost of leverage. ESRT's charter does not restrict the amount of leverage that we may use.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had approximately $233.9 million available in cash and cash equivalents and there was $1.1 billion available under our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nThrough August 2021, QIA will have a right of first offer to co-invest with us as a joint venture partner in real estate investment opportunities initiated by us where we have elected, at our discretion, to seek out a joint venture partner in real estate investment opportunities. The right of first offer period will be extended for 30 months so long as at least one joint venture transaction is consummated by us and QIA during the initial term, and will be extended for a further 30-month term if at least one more joint venture transaction is consummated during such initial extension period.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $1.7 billion of total consolidated indebtedness outstanding, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.03% and a weighted average maturity of 8.3 years. As of December 31, 2019, exclusive of\nprincipal amortization, we have approximately $265.0 million of debt maturing in 2022. Our consolidated net debt to total market capitalization was approximately 25.2% as of December 31, 2019.\nUnsecured Revolving Credit and Term Loan Facility\nAmount. The unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility is comprised of a $1.1 billion revolving credit facility and a $265 million term loan facility. The new revolving facility replaced our existing credit facility which was due to mature in January 2019 and was undrawn at the time of the amendment. The term loan facility was borrowed in full at closing and used to repay an existing $265 million term loan. The unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility contains an accordion feature that would allow us to increase the maximum aggregate principal amount to $1.75 billion under specified circumstances.\nGuarantors. Certain of our subsidiaries are guarantors of our obligations under the unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility.\nInterest. Amounts outstanding under the (a) term loan facility bear interest at a floating rate equal to, at our election, (x) the Eurodollar rate, plus a spread that we expect will range from 0.900% to 1.800% depending upon our leverage ratio and credit rating, or (y) a base rate, plus a spread that we expect will range from 0.000% to 0.800% depending upon our leverage ratio and credit rating and (b) revolving credit facility bear interest at a floating rate equal to, at our election, (x) the Eurodollar rate, plus a spread that we expect will range from 0.825% to 1.550% depending upon our leverage ratio and credit rating or (y) a base rate, plus a spread that we expect will range from 0.000% to 0.550% depending upon our leverage ratio and credit rating.\nMaturity. The initial maturity of the unsecured revolving credit facility is August 2021. We have the option to extend the initial term for up to two additional six-month periods, subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.0625% and 0.075% of the then outstanding commitments under the unsecured revolving credit facility on the first and the second extensions, respectively. The term loan facility matures in August 2022.\nFinancial Covenants. The unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility includes the following financial covenants: (i) maximum leverage ratio of total indebtedness to total asset value (as defined in the agreement) of the loan parties and their consolidated subsidiaries will not exceed 60%, (ii) consolidated secured indebtedness will not exceed 40% of total asset value, (iii) tangible net worth will not be less than $1.2 billion plus 75% of net equity proceeds received by the Operating Partnership (other than proceeds received within ninety days after the redemption, retirement or repurchase of ownership or equity interests in the Operating Partnership up to the amount paid by the Operating Partnership in connection with such redemption, retirement or repurchase, where, the net effect is that the Operating Partnership shall not have increased its net worth as a result of any such proceeds), (iv) adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the unsecured revolving credit facility) to consolidated fixed charges will not be less than 1.50x, (v) the aggregate net operating income with respect to all unencumbered eligible properties to the portion of interest expense attributable to unsecured indebtedness will not be less than 1.75x, and (vi) the ratio of total unsecured indebtedness to unencumbered asset value will not exceed 60%.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the covenants, as described below (dollars in thousands):\n\nOther Covenants. The unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility contains customary covenants, including limitations on liens, investment, debt, fundamental changes, and transactions with affiliates, and requires certain customary financial reports.\nEvents of Default. The unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility contains customary events of default (subject in certain cases to specified cure periods), including but not limited to non-payment, breach of covenants, representations or warranties, cross defaults, bankruptcy or other insolvency events, judgments, ERISA events, invalidity of loan documents, loss\nof real estate investment trust qualification, and occurrence of a change of control (defined in the definitive documentation for the unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility).\nExchangeable Senior Notes\nDuring August 2019, we settled the $250.0 million principal amount of the 2.625% Exchangeable Senior Notes in cash. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nSeries A, B, C, D, E and F Senior Notes (collectively, \"Senior Unsecured Notes\") are senior unsecured obligations with an aggregate principal amount of $800.0 million maturing on various dates from 2025 to 2033. These Senior Unsecured Notes are unconditionally guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries that guarantees indebtedness under the unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility. Interest on the Senior Unsecured Notes is payable quarterly.\nThe terms of the Senior Unsecured Notes include customary covenants, including limitations on liens, investment, debt, fundamental changes, and transactions with affiliates and require certain customary financial reports. The Senior Unsecured Notes also require compliance with financial ratios including a maximum leverage ratio, a maximum secured leverage ratio, a minimum amount of tangible net worth, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a minimum unencumbered interest coverage ratio, and a maximum unsecured leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the covenants under the outstanding Senior Unsecured Notes.\nMortgage Debt\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had mortgage notes payable, net of $605.5 million. The first maturity is in 2024.\nLeverage Policies\nWe expect to employ leverage in our capital structure in amounts determined from time to time by our board of directors. Although ESRT's board of directors has not adopted a policy that limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur, we anticipate that ESRT's board of directors will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from time to time, as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be either fixed or floating rate. ESRT's charter and bylaws do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that we may incur nor do they restrict the form in which our indebtedness will be taken (including, but not limited to, recourse or non-recourse debt and cross collateralized debt). Our overall leverage depends on our mix of investments and the cost of leverage, however, we maintain a level of indebtedness consistent with our plan to seek an investment grade credit rating. ESRT's board of directors may from time to time modify our leverage policies in light of the then-current economic conditions, relative costs of debt and equity capital, market values of our properties, general market conditions for debt and equity securities, fluctuations in the market price of ESRT's common stock and our traded OP units, growth and acquisition opportunities and other factors.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe following tables summarize our tenant improvement costs, leasing commission costs and our capital expenditures for each of the periods presented (dollars in thousands, except per square foot amounts).\nOffice Properties(1)\n\nRetail Properties(4)\n\n_______________\n (1) Excludes an aggregate of 511,984, 513,606 and 507,395 rentable square feet of retail space in our Manhattan office properties in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Includes the Empire State Building broadcasting licenses and observatory operations. \n (2) Presents a renewed and expansion lease as one lease signed. \n (3) Presents all tenant improvement and leasing commission costs as if they were incurred in the period in which the lease was signed, which may be different than the period in which they were actually paid. \n (4) Includes an aggregate of 511,984, 513,606 and 507,395 rentable square feet of retail space in our Manhattan office properties in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Excludes the Empire State Building broadcasting licenses and observatory operations. \n\n_______________\n (1) Includes all capital expenditures, excluding tenant improvements and leasing commission costs, which are primarily attributable to the redevelopment and repositioning program conducted at our Manhattan office properties.  As of December 31, 2019, we expect to incur additional costs relating to obligations under signed new leases of approximately $125.9 million for tenant improvements and leasing commissions. We intend to fund the tenant improvements and leasing commission costs through a combination of operating cash flow, cash on hand, short term investments and borrowings under the unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility.\nCapital expenditures are considered part of both our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements. We intend to fund the capital improvements to complete the redevelopment and repositioning program through a combination of operating cash flow, cash on hand, short term investments and borrowings under the unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes the amounts due in connection with our contractual obligations described below for the years ending December 31, 2020 through 2024 and thereafter (amounts in thousands).\n\n_______________\n (1) Assumes no extension options are exercised. \n (2) Does not include various standing or renewal service contracts with vendors related to our property management.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2019, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nDistribution Policy\nIn order for ESRT to qualify as a REIT, it must distribute to its securityholders, on an annual basis, at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains. In addition, it will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it distributes less than 100% of its net taxable income (including net capital gains) and will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which its distributions in any calendar year are less than a minimum amount specified under U.S. federal income tax laws. We intend to distribute our net taxable income to our securityholders in a manner intended to allow ESRT to satisfy its REIT 90% distribution requirement and to allow ESRT to avoid U.S. federal income tax liability on its income and the 4% nondeductible excise tax.\nBefore we pay any distribution, we must first meet both our operating requirements and obligations to make payments of principal and interest, if any. However, under some circumstances, we may be required to use cash reserves, incur debt or liquidate assets at rates or times that we regard as unfavorable in order to allow ESRT to satisfy its REIT 90% distribution requirement and to avoid U.S. federal income tax and the 4% nondeductible excise tax in that year.\nDistribution to Equity Holders\nDistributions and dividends have been made to equity holders in 2017, 2018 and 2019 as follows (amounts in thousands):\n\nStock and Publicly Traded Operating Partnership Unit Repurchase Program\nOur Board of Directors reauthorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of ESRT's Class A common stock and our Series ES, Series 250 and Series 60 operating partnership units through December 31, 2020.\nUnder the program, we may purchase ESRT's Class A common stock and our Series ES, Series 250 and Series 60 operating partnership units in accordance with applicable securities laws from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases will be determined by us at our discretion and will be subject to stock price, availability, trading volume and general market conditions. The authorization does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of securities, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at our discretion without prior notice.\nPrivate Perpetual Preferred Units\nDuring December 2019, we completed an exchange offer whereby we issued 4,610,383 new Series 2019 Private Perpetual Preferred Units in exchange for 4,610,383 OP units, consisting of 1,632,667 Series ES OP Units, 186,799 Series 250 OP Units, 302,608 Series 60 OP Units and 2,488,309 Series PR OP Units. The OP units acquired in the exchange offer were retired upon receipt. The Series 2019 Private Perpetual Preferred Units were issued in the exchange offer in reliance on the exemption set forth in Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, for securities exchanged by an issuer with its existing security holders exclusively where no commission or other remuneration is paid or given directly or indirectly for soliciting such exchange.\nThe Series 2019 Private Perpetual Preferred Units have a liquidation preference of $13.52 per unit and are entitled to receive cumulative preferential annual cash distributions of $0.70 per unit payable in arrears on a quarterly basis. The Series 2019 Private Perpetual Preferred Units are not redeemable at the option of the holders and are redeemable at our option only in the case of specific defined events.\nCash Flows\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2019 to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nNet cash. Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash were $271.6 million and $270.8 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the maturity of investments in short-term time deposits was largely offset by capital improvements and expenditures and the repayment of our exchangeable unsecured senior notes resulting in approximately the same balances for cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash at the end of 2019 when compared to 2018.\nOperating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $46.5 million to $232.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $279.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily attributable to the return of security deposits to various tenants and to the settlement of a derivative contract.\nInvesting activities. Net cash provided by investing activities increased by $792.7 million to $149.7 million provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $643.0 million net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 due to proceeds from maturing short-term time deposits, partially offset by increased expenditures for additions to building and improvements in the year ended December 31, 2019.\nFinancing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities decreased by $486.1 million to $381.5 million used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $104.6 million provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 due to the repayment of our exchangeable unsecured senior notes in 2019. Additionally, the net proceeds from issuance of debt was higher in 2018 compared to 2019.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2018 to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nNet cash. Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash were $270.8 million and $530.2 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to investments in short-term time deposits and capital\nimprovements and expenditures offset by net proceeds from the issuance of debt during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOperating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $84.8 million to $279.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $194.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 mainly attributable to payments of operating liabilities that occurred in 2017 which were absent in 2018. 2017 included a payment of an amount owed to the estate of Leona M. Helmsley, as required under our formation agreements, equal to the New York City transfer taxes which would have been payable by us in absence of the estate's exemption from such tax. This amount had been accrued as a liability at our formation in October 2013 and became payable upon the taxing authority's final approval of such exemption in September 2017, so the reduction in our liabilities matched the reduction in our cash.\nInvesting activities. Net cash used in investing activities increased by $420.0 million to $643.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $223.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to investments in short-term time deposits made during 2018.\nFinancing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities increased by $161.5 million to $104.6 million provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $56.9 million used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net proceeds from issuance of debt was higher in 2018 compared to 2017.\nNet Operating Income\nOur financial reports include a discussion of property net operating income, or NOI. NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. NOI is used by our management to evaluate and compare the performance of our properties and to determine trends in earnings and to compute the fair value of our properties as it is not affected by: (i) the cost of funds of the property owner, (ii) the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets that are included in net income computed in accordance with GAAP, (iii) acquisition expenses, loss on early extinguishment of debt and loss from derivative financial instruments, or (iv) general and administrative expenses and other gains and losses that are specific to the property owner. The cost of funds is eliminated from NOI because it is specific to the particular financing capabilities and constraints of the owner. The cost of funds is eliminated because it is dependent on historical interest rates and other costs of capital as well as past decisions made by us regarding the appropriate mix of capital which may have changed or may change in the future. Depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets are eliminated because they may not accurately represent the actual change in value in our office or retail properties that result from use of the properties or changes in market conditions. While certain aspects of real property do decline in value over time in a manner that is reasonably captured by depreciation and amortization, the value of the properties as a whole have historically increased or decreased as a result of changes in overall economic conditions\ninstead of from actual use of the property or the passage of time. Gains and losses from the sale of real property vary from property to property and are affected by market conditions at the time of sale which will usually change from period to period. These gains and losses can create distortions when comparing one period to another or when comparing our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies that have not made similarly-timed purchases or sales. We believe that eliminating these costs from net income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue, generated and actual expenses incurred in operating our properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.\nHowever, the usefulness of NOI is limited because it excludes general and administrative costs, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense and gains or losses from the sale of properties, and other gains and losses as stipulated by GAAP, the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which are significant economic costs. NOI may fail to capture significant trends in these components of net income which further limits its usefulness.\nNOI is a measure of the operating performance of our properties but does not measure our performance as a whole. NOI is therefore not a substitute for net income as computed in accordance with GAAP. This measure should be analyzed in conjunction with net income computed in accordance with GAAP and discussions elsewhere in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations regarding the components of net income that are eliminated in the calculation of NOI. Other companies may use different methods for calculating NOI or similarly titled measures and, accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies that do not define the measure exactly as we do.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of our net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to NOI for the periods presented (amounts in thousands):\n\nFunds from Operations (\"FFO\")\nWe present below a discussion of FFO. We compute FFO in accordance with the White Paper\u201d on FFO published by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, which defines FFO as net income (loss) (determined in accordance with GAAP), excluding impairment writedowns of investments in depreciable real estate and investments in in-substance real estate investments, gains or losses from debt restructurings and sales of depreciable operating properties, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), less distributions to non-controlling interests and gains/losses from discontinued operations and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is a widely recognized non-GAAP financial measure for REITs that we believe, when considered with financial statements determined in accordance with GAAP, is useful to investors in\nunderstanding financial performance and providing a relevant basis for comparison among REITS. In addition, FFO is useful to investors as it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate has generally appreciated over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciable assets. Investors should review FFO, along with GAAP net income, when trying to understand an equity REIT's operating performance. We present FFO because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our results of operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of performance is limited. There can be no assurance that FFO presented by us is comparable to similarly titled measures of other REITs. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. FFO is not indicative of cash available to fund ongoing cash needs, including the ability to make cash distributions. Although FFO is a measure used for comparability in assessing the performance of REITs, as the NAREIT White Paper only provides guidelines for computing FFO, the computation of FFO may vary from one company to another.\nModified Funds From Operations (\"Modified FFO\")\nModified FFO adds back an adjustment for any above or below-market ground lease amortization to traditionally defined FFO. We consider this a useful supplemental measure in evaluating our operating performance due to the non-cash accounting treatment under GAAP, which stems from the third quarter 2014 acquisition of two option properties following our formation transactions as they carry significantly below market ground leases, the amortization of which is material to our overall results. We present Modified FFO because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance in that it adds back the non-cash amortization of below-market ground leases. There can be no assurance that Modified FFO presented by us is comparable to similarly titled measures of other REITs. Modified FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. Modified FFO is not indicative of cash available to fund ongoing cash needs, including the ability to make cash distributions.\nCore Funds From Operations (\"Core FFO\")\nCore FFO adds back to traditionally defined FFO the following items: acquisition expenses, severance expenses, retirement equity compensation expenses, private perpetual preferred exchange offering expenses, deferred tax asset write-off, loss on early extinguishment of debt, acquisition expenses, gain on settlement of lawsuit related to the Observatory, net of income taxes, ground lease amortization, construction severance expenses and acquisition break-up fee. The Company presents Core FFO because it considers it an important supplemental measure of its operating performance in that it excludes items associated with its IPO and formation transactions and other non-recurring items. There can be no assurance that Core FFO presented by the Company is comparable to similarly titled measures of other REITs. Core FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. Core FFO is not indicative of cash available to fund ongoing cash needs, including the ability to make cash distributions. In future periods, we may also exclude other items from Core FFO that we believe may help investors compare our results.\nThe following", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. For these statements, we claim the protections of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in such Section. Forward-looking statements are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and are generally beyond our control. In particular, statements pertaining to our capital resources, portfolio performance, dividend policy and results of operations contain forward-looking statements.

Net operating income for the year ended December 31, 2019, decreased by 3.5% to $95.0 million from $98.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. As a reminder, the 102nd floor observation deck was closed for approximately nine months in 2019 and reopened on October 12, 2019. \n \u2022 Declared and paid aggregate dividends of $0.42 per share during 2019.  As of December 31, 2019, our total portfolio contained 10.1 million rentable square feet of office and retail space. We owned 14 office properties (including three long-term ground leasehold interests) encompassing approximately 9.4 million rentable square feet of office space. Nine of these properties are located in the midtown Manhattan market and aggregate approximately 7.6 million rentable square feet of office space, including the Empire State Building. Our Manhattan office properties also contain an aggregate of 511,984 rentable square feet of premier retail space on their ground floor and/or contiguous levels. Our remaining five office properties are located in Fairfield County, Connecticut and Westchester County, New York, encompassing in the aggregate approximately 1.8 million rentable square feet. The majority of square footage for\nthese five properties is located in densely populated metropolitan communities with immediate access to mass transportation. Additionally, we have entitled land at the Stamford Transportation Center in Stamford, Connecticut, adjacent to one of our office properties, that will support the development of an approximately 415,000 rentable square foot office building and garage, which we refer to herein as Metro Tower. As of December 31, 2019, our portfolio included four standalone retail properties located in Manhattan and two standalone retail properties located in the city center of Westport, Connecticut, encompassing 205,595 rentable square feet in the aggregate.\nThe Empire State Building is our flagship property. The Empire State Building provides us with a diverse source of revenue through its office and retail leases, observatory operations, and broadcasting licenses and related leased space. Our observatory operations are a separate reporting segment. Our observatory operations are subject to regular patterns of tourist activity in Manhattan. During the past ten years, approximately 16% to 18% of our annual observatory revenue was realized in the first quarter, 26.0% to 28.0% was realized in the second quarter, 31.0% to 33.0% was realized in the third quarter, and 23.0% to 25.0% was realized in the fourth quarter.\nThe components of the Empire State Building revenue are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office leases\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail leases\n</td> <td>7,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant reimbursements, lease termination fees and other income\n</td> <td>31,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Observatory operations\n</td> <td>128,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>131,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Broadcasting licenses and leases\n</td> <td>16,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>327,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>335,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have been undertaking a comprehensive redevelopment and repositioning strategy of our Manhattan office properties. This strategy is designed to improve the overall value and attractiveness of our properties and has contributed significantly to our tenant repositioning efforts, which seek to increase our occupancy, raise our rental rates, increase our rentable square feet, increase our aggregate rental revenue, lengthen our average lease term, increase our average lease size, and improve our tenant credit quality. These improvements include restored, renovated and upgraded or new lobbies, elevator modernization, renovated public areas and bathrooms, refurbished or new windows, upgrade and standardization of retail storefront and signage, fa\u00e7ade restorations, modernization of building-wide systems, and enhanced tenant amenities. We have also aggregated smaller spaces in order to offer larger blocks of office space, including multiple floors, that are attractive to larger, higher credit-quality tenants as well as to offer new, pre-built suites with improved layouts. This strategy has shown what we believe to be attractive results to date, and we believe has the potential to improve our operating margins and cash flows in the future. We believe we will continue to enhance our tenant base and improve rents as our pre-redevelopment leases continue to expire and be re-leased. From 2002 through December 31, 2019, we have invested a total of approximately $918.6 million (excluding tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions) in our Manhattan office properties pursuant to this program. We intend to fund these capital improvements through a combination of operating cash flow, cash on hand, short term investments and borrowings.\nDuring the second quarter 2017, we commenced a multi-year capital project at the Empire State Building, which we completed during the fourth quarter 2019, that we believe improves the convenience for office tenants and their visitors, increases the value of our 34th Street facing retail space, enhances the Observatory visitor experience, and increases Observatory revenue per capita.\nIn the first phase completed in August 2018, we relocated the Observatory entrance, previously located on Fifth Avenue, to a new, larger, dedicated entrance for Observatory visitors at the western side of the Empire State Building on 34th Street. The new entrance eliminates Observatory visitor flow into the Fifth Avenue lobby and streamlines the visitor exit from that lobby, thereby reducing Observatory traffic in the lobby by more than 50% and improving Fifth Avenue access for our office tenants and their visitors.\nDuring the third quarter 2019 we opened the second phase of the project, the new second floor galleries and in the fourth quarter 2019 we completed the final phase, the redevelopment of the 80th floor and opened the newly renovated 102nd floor observatory.\nThe elevator servicing the 102nd floor Observatory was closed to visitors during the first quarter of 2018 for planned replacement of the original machinery and a new glass cab for the elevator which serves it. The 102nd floor Observatory was closed for approximately nine months in 2019 and opened on October 12, 2019. Revenue for the 102nd floor observatory was $3.6 million, $8.6 million and $11.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, The decrease in revenue is primarily related to the closures.\nWe have now completed all phases of this project. Expenditures for the improvement project, which began during the second quarter 2017, were $155.4 million through December 31, 2019. This investment is an example of continually looking at ways to innovate and enhance the office and retail tenant and visitor experience at the Empire State Building.\nThe Greater New York metropolitan area office market is soft, and we compete with properties that have been redeveloped recently or have planned redevelopment. We expect to spend approximately $40.0 million through 2020 on our well-maintained and well-located properties' common areas and amenities to enhance competitiveness and protect our market position. Expenditures, which began during the second quarter 2018, were $29.0 million through December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2019, excluding principal amortization, we had approximately $265.0 million of debt maturing in 2022, and we had total debt outstanding of approximately $1.7 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.03% (excluding premiums and discount) and a weighted average maturity of 8.3 years and 100.0% of which is fixed-rate indebtedness. As of December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $233.9 million. Our consolidated net debt to total market capitalization was approximately 25.2% as of December 31, 2019.\nResults of Operations\nOverview\nThe discussion below relates to the financial condition and

</tr>\n</table>\nRental Revenue and Tenant Expense Reimbursement\nWe adopted FASB Topic 842 using the modified retrospective approach as of January 1, 2019 and elected to apply the\ntransition provisions of the standard at adoption. As such, the prior period amounts presented under ASC 840 were not restated\nto conform with the 2019 presentation. We adopted the practical expedient in Topic 842, which allowed us to avoid separating\nlease and non-lease rental income. Consequently, all rental income earned pursuant to tenant leases in 2019 is reflected as one\ncategory, Rental Revenue,\u201d in the 2019 consolidated statement of income. The following table reflects the components of\n2019 rental revenue: Table 138: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Base rent\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>511,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant expense reimbursement\n</td> <td>75,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total rental revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>586,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe the preceding table of the components of rental revenue is not, and is not intended to be, a presentation in\naccordance with GAAP. It is provided here based on our understanding that such information is frequently used by management, investors, securities analysts and other interested parties to evaluate our performance.\nThe increase in base rent revenue was attributable to increased rental rates, partially offset by decreased broadcasting licenses and holdover rent.\nThe increase in billed tenant expense reimbursement was primarily due to reimbursements related to higher property\noperating expenses.\nObservatory Revenue\nObservatory revenues were lower primarily driven by the closure of the 102nd floor observation deck for approximately nine months in 2019 as part of the Observatory upgrade program and visitor decline, partially offset by improved pricing.\nLease Termination Fees\nThe year ended December 31, 2018 included significantly higher lease termination fees, from a combination of broadcast and office tenants, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThird-Party Management and Other Fees\nThe decrease reflects lower management fee income due to fewer assets under management.\nOther Revenues and Fees\nThe decrease in other revenues and fees is primarily due to a $2.8 million settlement with a former broadcast tenant recognized in the year ended December 31, 2018 partially offset by a property tax refund received in the year ended December 31, 2019.\nProperty Operating Expenses\nThe increase in property operating expenses was primarily due to higher repair and labor costs partially offset by lower utility costs.\nGround Rent Expenses\nThe ground rent expense was consistent with 2018.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased equity compensation expenses as well as higher leasing costs which were previously capitalized prior to our adoption of Topic 842, Lease Accounting on January 1, 2019, which requires that non-contingent leasing costs be expensed as incurred. Also contributing to the increase were costs associated with the 2019 private perpetual preferred units exchange offer.\nObservatory Expenses\nObservatory expenses increased primarily due to higher information technology consulting fees and higher marketing costs.\nReal Estate Taxes\nThe increase in real estate taxes was primarily attributable to higher assessed values for multiple properties.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe increase in depreciation and amortization was attributable to additional depreciation on assets newly placed in service during the year as well as the acceleration of depreciation of $2.0 million in connection with a partial termination agreement.\nInterest Income\nThe increase in interest income was primarily due to higher rates and the timing of short-term time deposits during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was consistent with 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nThe decrease in income tax expense was attributable to lower revenues and higher operating expenses for the Observatory segment.\nPrivate Perpetual Preferred Unit Distributions\nPrivate perpetual preferred unit distributions increased due to dividends paid on a new series of private perpetual preferred units issued by the operating partnership in December 2019 in connection with the settlement of an exchange offer for outstanding traded OP units. Holders of the new series of private perpetual preferred units are entitled to receive cumulative preferential annual cash distributions of $0.70 per units when, as and if declared by the board of directors of the company.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe following table summarizes the historical results of operations for years ended December 31,

in rental income was primarily attributable to increased rental rates.\nTenant Expense Reimbursement\nThe decrease in tenant expense reimbursements was due to a reduction in broadcasting expense reimbursements.\nObservatory Revenue\nObservatory revenues were higher primarily due to an improvement in our ticket mix and higher per person average\nticket price, partially offset by the scheduled closure of the 102nd floor observation deck in the first quarter 2018 for\nreplacement of original elevator machinery.\nLease Termination Fees\nThe year ended December 31, 2018 included significantly higher lease termination fees, from a combination of broadcast and office tenants, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThird-Party Management and Other Fees\nThird-party management and other fees were consistent with 2017.\nOther Revenues and Fees\nThe increase in other revenues and fees for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to a $2.8\nmillion settlement with a former broadcast tenant.\nProperty Operating Expenses\nThe increase in property operating expenses was primarily due to higher repairs and maintenance costs and higher labor costs.\nGround Rent Expenses\nThe ground rent expense was consistent with 2017.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased equity compensation expense.\nObservatory Expenses\nThe increase in Observatory expenses was primarily due to higher payroll costs of $0.8 million, higher technology costs of $0.7 million and higher marketing costs of $0.6 million.\nReal Estate Taxes\nThe increase in real estate taxes was primarily attributable to higher assessed values for multiple properties.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to depreciation of assets newly placed in service together with the accelerated depreciation of retired assets, partially offset by lower amortization of purchase accounting deferred leasing costs associated with 2013 and 2014 acquisitions as these costs become fully amortized.\nInterest Income\nInterest income increased primarily due to higher interest rates on cash balances and short-term investments.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased due to higher outstanding principal balances.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt\nThere was no loss on early extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nLoss from Derivative Financial Instruments\nThere was no loss from derivative financial instruments for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nThe decrease in income tax expense was primarily attributable to a reduction in the federal corporate tax rate.\nPrivate Perpetual Preferred Unit Distributions\nThe private perpetual preferred unit distributions were consistent with 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund and maintain our assets and operations, including lease-up costs, fund our redevelopment and repositioning programs, acquire properties, make distributions to our securityholders and other general business needs. Based on the historical experience of our management and our business strategy, in the foreseeable future we anticipate we will generate positive cash flows from operations. In order for ESRT to qualify as a REIT, ESRT is required under the Code to distribute to its securityholders, on an annual basis, at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains. We expect to make quarterly distributions to our securityholders.\nWhile we may be able to anticipate and plan for certain liquidity needs, there may be unexpected increases in uses of cash that are beyond our control and which would affect our financial condition and results of operations. For example, we may be required to comply with new laws or regulations that cause us to incur unanticipated capital expenditures for our properties, thereby increasing our liquidity needs. Even if there are no material changes to our anticipated liquidity requirements, our sources of liquidity may be fewer than, and the funds available from such sources may be less than, anticipated or needed. Our primary sources of liquidity will generally consist of cash on hand, short term investments, cash generated from our operating activities, debt issuances and unused borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements, including distributions, operating expenses, working capital, debt service, and capital expenditures from cash flows from operations, cash and short-term investments, debt issuances, and available borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility. The availability of these borrowings is subject to the conditions set forth in the applicable loan agreements. We expect to meet our long-term capital requirements, including acquisitions, redevelopments and capital expenditures through our cash flows from operations, cash on hand, short term investments, our unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility, mortgage financings, debt issuances, common and/or preferred equity issuances and asset sales. Our properties require periodic investments of capital for individual lease related tenant improvements allowances, general capital improvements and costs associated with capital expenditures. Our overall leverage will depend on our mix of investments and the cost of leverage. ESRT's charter does not restrict the amount of leverage that we may use.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had approximately $233.9 million available in cash and cash equivalents and there was $1.1 billion available under our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nThrough August 2021, QIA will have a right of first offer to co-invest with us as a joint venture partner in real estate investment opportunities initiated by us where we have elected, at our discretion, to seek out a joint venture partner in real estate investment opportunities. The right of first offer period will be extended for 30 months so long as at least one joint venture transaction is consummated by us and QIA during the initial term, and will be extended for a further 30-month term if at least one more joint venture transaction is consummated during such initial extension period.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $1.7 billion of total consolidated indebtedness outstanding, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.03% and a weighted average maturity of 8.3 years. As of December 31, 2019, exclusive of\nprincipal amortization, we have approximately $265.0 million of debt maturing in 2022. Our consolidated net debt to total market capitalization was approximately 25.2% as of December 31, 2019.\nUnsecured Revolving Credit and Term Loan Facility\nAmount. The unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility is comprised of a $1.1 billion revolving credit facility and a $265 million term loan facility. The new revolving facility replaced our existing credit facility which was due to mature in January 2019 and was undrawn at the time of the amendment. The term loan facility was borrowed in full at closing and used to repay an existing $265 million term loan. The unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility contains an accordion feature that would allow us to increase the maximum aggregate principal amount to $1.75 billion under specified circumstances.\nGuarantors. Certain of our subsidiaries are guarantors of our obligations under the unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility.\nInterest. Amounts outstanding under the (a) term loan facility bear interest at a floating rate equal to, at our election, (x) the Eurodollar rate, plus a spread that we expect will range from 0.900% to 1.800% depending upon our leverage ratio and credit rating, or (y) a base rate, plus a spread that we expect will range from 0.000% to 0.800% depending upon our leverage ratio and credit rating and (b) revolving credit facility bear interest at a floating rate equal to, at our election, (x) the Eurodollar rate, plus a spread that we expect will range from 0.825% to 1.550% depending upon our leverage ratio and credit rating or (y) a base rate, plus a spread that we expect will range from 0.000% to 0.550% depending upon our leverage ratio and credit rating.\nMaturity. The initial maturity of the unsecured revolving credit facility is August 2021. We have the option to extend the initial term for up to two additional six-month periods, subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.0625% and 0.075% of the then outstanding commitments under the unsecured revolving credit facility on the first and the second extensions, respectively. The term loan facility matures in August 2022.\nFinancial Covenants. The unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility includes the following financial covenants: (i) maximum leverage ratio of total indebtedness to total asset value (as defined in the agreement) of the loan parties and their consolidated subsidiaries will not exceed 60%, (ii) consolidated secured indebtedness will not exceed 40% of total asset value, (iii) tangible net worth will not be less than $1.2 billion plus 75% of net equity proceeds received by the Operating Partnership (other than proceeds received within ninety days after the redemption, retirement or repurchase of ownership or equity interests in the Operating Partnership up to the amount paid by the Operating Partnership in connection with such redemption, retirement or repurchase, where, the net effect is that the Operating Partnership shall not have increased its net worth as a result of any such proceeds), (iv) adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the unsecured revolving credit facility) to consolidated fixed charges will not be less than 1.50x, (v) the aggregate net operating income with respect to all unencumbered eligible properties to the portion of interest expense attributable to unsecured indebtedness will not be less than 1.75x, and (vi) the ratio of total unsecured indebtedness to unencumbered asset value will not exceed 60%.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the covenants, as described below (dollars in thousands):\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial Covenant\n</td> <td>Required\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>In Compliance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maximum total leverage\n</td> <td>< 60%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>Yes\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maximum secured debt\n</td> <td>< 40%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>Yes\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum fixed charge coverage\n</td> <td>> 1.50x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Yes\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum unencumbered interest coverage\n</td> <td>> 1.75x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Yes\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maximum unsecured leverage\n</td> <td>< 60%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>Yes\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum tangible net worth\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,252,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,862,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Yes\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Covenants. The unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility contains customary covenants, including limitations on liens, investment, debt, fundamental changes, and transactions with affiliates, and requires certain customary financial reports.\nEvents of Default. The unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility contains customary events of default (subject in certain cases to specified cure periods), including but not limited to non-payment, breach of covenants, representations or warranties, cross defaults, bankruptcy or other insolvency events, judgments, ERISA events, invalidity of loan documents, loss\nof real estate investment trust qualification, and occurrence of a change of control (defined in the definitive documentation for the unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility).\nExchangeable Senior Notes\nDuring August 2019, we settled the $250.0 million principal amount of the 2.625% Exchangeable Senior Notes in cash. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nSeries A, B, C, D, E and F Senior Notes (collectively, \"Senior Unsecured Notes\") are senior unsecured obligations with an aggregate principal amount of $800.0 million maturing on various dates from 2025 to 2033. These Senior Unsecured Notes are unconditionally guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries that guarantees indebtedness under the unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility. Interest on the Senior Unsecured Notes is payable quarterly.\nThe terms of the Senior Unsecured Notes include customary covenants, including limitations on liens, investment, debt, fundamental changes, and transactions with affiliates and require certain customary financial reports. The Senior Unsecured Notes also require compliance with financial ratios including a maximum leverage ratio, a maximum secured leverage ratio, a minimum amount of tangible net worth, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a minimum unencumbered interest coverage ratio, and a maximum unsecured leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the covenants under the outstanding Senior Unsecured Notes.\nMortgage Debt\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had mortgage notes payable, net of $605.5 million. The first maturity is in 2024.\nLeverage Policies\nWe expect to employ leverage in our capital structure in amounts determined from time to time by our board of directors. Although ESRT's board of directors has not adopted a policy that limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur, we anticipate that ESRT's board of directors will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from time to time, as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be either fixed or floating rate. ESRT's charter and bylaws do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that we may incur nor do they restrict the form in which our indebtedness will be taken (including, but not limited to, recourse or non-recourse debt and cross collateralized debt). Our overall leverage depends on our mix of investments and the cost of leverage, however, we maintain a level of indebtedness consistent with our plan to seek an investment grade credit rating. ESRT's board of directors may from time to time modify our leverage policies in light of the then-current economic conditions, relative costs of debt and equity capital, market values of our properties, general market conditions for debt and equity securities, fluctuations in the market price of ESRT's common stock and our traded OP units, growth and acquisition opportunities and other factors.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe following tables summarize our tenant improvement costs, leasing commission costs and our capital expenditures for each of the periods presented (dollars in thousands, except per square foot amounts).\nOffice Properties(1)\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total New Leases, Expansions, and Renewals\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of leases signed(2)\n</td> <td>152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>155\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total square feet\n</td> <td>1,216,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>991,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,198,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing commission costs(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant improvement costs(3)\n</td> <td>70,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total leasing commissions and tenant improvement costs(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing commission costs per square foot(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.06\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant improvement costs per square foot(3)\n</td> <td>58.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70.48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total leasing commissions and tenant improvement costs per square foot(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75.55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88.37\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRetail Properties(4)\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total New Leases, Expansions, and Renewals\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of leases signed(2)\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Square Feet\n</td> <td>87,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing commission costs(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant improvement costs(3)\n</td> <td>3,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total leasing commissions and tenant improvement costs(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing commission costs per square foot(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27.08\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46.33\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant improvement costs per square foot(3)\n</td> <td>38.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.35\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total leasing commissions and tenant improvement costs per square foot(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78.91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72.79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77.68\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\n (1) Excludes an aggregate of 511,984, 513,606 and 507,395 rentable square feet of retail space in our Manhattan office properties in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2019, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nDistribution Policy\nIn order for ESRT to qualify as a REIT, it must distribute to its securityholders, on an annual basis, at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains. In addition, it will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it distributes less than 100% of its net taxable income (including net capital gains) and will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which its distributions in any calendar year are less than a minimum amount specified under U.S. federal income tax laws. We intend to distribute our net taxable income to our securityholders in a manner intended to allow ESRT to satisfy its REIT 90% distribution requirement and to allow ESRT to avoid U.S. federal income tax liability on its income and the 4% nondeductible excise tax.\nBefore we pay any distribution, we must first meet both our operating requirements and obligations to make payments of principal and interest, if any. However, under some circumstances, we may be required to use cash reserves, incur debt or liquidate assets at rates or times that we regard as unfavorable in order to allow ESRT to satisfy its REIT 90% distribution requirement and to avoid U.S. federal income tax and the 4% nondeductible excise tax in that year.\nDistribution to Equity Holders\nDistributions and dividends have been made to equity holders in 2017, 2018 and 2019 as follows (amounts in thousands):\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>126,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>126,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>127,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nStock and Publicly Traded Operating Partnership Unit Repurchase Program\nOur Board of Directors reauthorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of ESRT's Class A common stock and our Series ES, Series 250 and Series 60 operating partnership units through December 31, 2020.\nUnder the program, we may purchase ESRT's Class A common stock and our Series ES, Series 250 and Series 60 operating partnership units in accordance with applicable securities laws from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases will be determined by us at our discretion and will be subject to stock price, availability, trading volume and general market conditions. The authorization does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of securities, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at our discretion without prior notice.\nPrivate Perpetual Preferred Units\nDuring December 2019, we completed an exchange offer whereby we issued 4,610,383 new Series 2019 Private Perpetual Preferred Units in exchange for 4,610,383 OP units, consisting of 1,632,667 Series ES OP Units, 186,799 Series 250 OP Units, 302,608 Series 60 OP Units and 2,488,309 Series PR OP Units. The OP units acquired in the exchange offer were retired upon receipt. The Series 2019 Private Perpetual Preferred Units were issued in the exchange offer in reliance on the exemption set forth in Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, for securities exchanged by an issuer with its existing security holders exclusively where no commission or other remuneration is paid or given directly or indirectly for soliciting such exchange.\nThe Series 2019 Private Perpetual Preferred Units have a liquidation preference of $13.52 per unit and are entitled to receive cumulative preferential annual cash distributions of $0.70 per unit payable in arrears on a quarterly basis. The Series 2019 Private Perpetual Preferred Units are not redeemable at the option of the holders and are redeemable at our option only in the case of specific defined events.\nCash Flows\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2019 to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nNet cash. Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash were $271.6 million and $270.8 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the maturity of investments in short-term time deposits was largely offset by capital improvements and expenditures and the repayment of our exchangeable unsecured senior notes resulting in approximately the same balances for cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash at the end of 2019 when compared to 2018.\nOperating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $46.5 million to $232.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $279.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily attributable to the return of security deposits to various tenants and to the settlement of a derivative contract.\nInvesting activities. Net cash provided by investing activities increased by $792.7 million to $149.7 million provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $643.0 million net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 due to proceeds from maturing short-term time deposits, partially offset by increased expenditures for additions to building and improvements in the year ended December 31, 2019.\nFinancing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities decreased by $486.1 million to $381.5 million used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $104.6 million provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 due to the repayment of our exchangeable unsecured senior notes in 2019. Additionally, the net proceeds from issuance of debt was higher in 2018 compared to 2019.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2018 to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nNet cash. Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash were $270.8 million and $530.2 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to investments in short-term time deposits and capital\nimprovements and expenditures offset by net proceeds from the issuance of debt during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOperating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $84.8 million to $279.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $194.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 mainly attributable to payments of operating liabilities that occurred in 2017 which were absent in 2018. 2017 included a payment of an amount owed to the estate of Leona M. Helmsley, as required under our formation agreements, equal to the New York City transfer taxes which would have been payable by us in absence of the estate's exemption from such tax. This amount had been accrued as a liability at our formation in October 2013 and became payable upon the taxing authority's final approval of such exemption in September 2017, so the reduction in our liabilities matched the reduction in our cash.\nInvesting activities. Net cash used in investing activities increased by $420.0 million to $643.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $223.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to investments in short-term time deposits made during 2018.\nFinancing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities increased by $161.5 million to $104.6 million provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $56.9 million used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net proceeds from issuance of debt was higher in 2018 compared to 2017.\nNet Operating Income\nOur financial reports include a discussion of property net operating income, or NOI. NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. NOI is used by our management to evaluate and compare the performance of our properties and to determine trends in earnings and to compute the fair value of our properties as it is not affected by: (i) the cost of funds of the property owner, (ii) the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets that are included in net income computed in accordance with GAAP, (iii) acquisition expenses, loss on early extinguishment of debt and loss from derivative financial instruments, or (iv) general and administrative expenses and other gains and losses that are specific to the property owner. The cost of funds is eliminated from NOI because it is specific to the particular financing capabilities and constraints of the owner. The cost of funds is eliminated because it is dependent on historical interest rates and other costs of capital as well as past decisions made by us regarding the appropriate mix of capital which may have changed or may change in the future. Depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets are eliminated because they may not accurately represent the actual change in value in our office or retail properties that result from use of the properties or changes in market conditions. While certain aspects of real property do decline in value over time in a manner that is reasonably captured by depreciation and amortization, the value of the properties as a whole have historically increased or decreased as a result of changes in overall economic conditions\ninstead of from actual use of the property or the passage of time. Gains and losses from the sale of real property vary from property to property and are affected by market conditions at the time of sale which will usually change from period to period. These gains and losses can create distortions when comparing one period to another or when comparing our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies that have not made similarly-timed purchases or sales. We believe that eliminating these costs from net income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue, generated and actual expenses incurred in operating our properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.\nHowever, the usefulness of NOI is limited because it excludes general and administrative costs, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense and gains or losses from the sale of properties, and other gains and losses as stipulated by GAAP, the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which are significant economic costs. NOI may fail to capture significant trends in these components of net income which further limits its usefulness.\nNOI is a measure of the operating performance of our properties but does not measure our performance as a whole. NOI is therefore not a substitute for net income as computed in accordance with GAAP. This measure should be analyzed in conjunction with net income computed in accordance with GAAP and discussions elsewhere in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations regarding the components of net income that are eliminated in the calculation of NOI. Other companies may use different methods for calculating NOI or similarly titled measures and, accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies that do not define the measure exactly as we do.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of our net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to NOI for the periods presented (amounts in thousands):\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>117,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>61,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>181,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>168,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>160,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>79,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on early extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from derivative financial instruments\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>289\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>2,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>(11,259\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,661\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,942\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third-party management and other fees\n</td> <td>(1,254\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,440\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,400\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>396,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>410,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>402,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Net Operating Income Data\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Straight line rental revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in rental revenue from the amortization of above and below-market lease assets and liabilities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of acquired below-market ground leases\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFunds from Operations (\"FFO\")\nWe present below a discussion of FFO. We compute FFO in accordance with the White Paper\u201d on FFO published by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, which defines FFO as net income (loss) (determined in accordance with GAAP), excluding impairment writedowns of investments in depreciable real estate and investments in in-substance real estate investments, gains or losses from debt restructurings and sales of depreciable operating properties, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), less distributions to non-controlling interests and gains/losses from discontinued operations and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is a widely recognized non-GAAP financial measure for REITs that we believe, when considered with financial statements determined in accordance with GAAP, is useful to investors in\nunderstanding financial performance and providing a relevant basis for comparison among REITS. In addition, FFO is useful to investors as it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate has generally appreciated over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciable assets. Investors should review FFO, along with GAAP net income, when trying to understand an equity REIT's operating performance. We present FFO because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our results of operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of performance is limited. There can be no assurance that FFO presented by us is comparable to similarly titled measures of other REITs. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. FFO is not indicative of cash available to fund ongoing cash needs, including the ability to make cash distributions. Although FFO is a measure used for comparability in assessing the performance of REITs, as the NAREIT White Paper only provides guidelines for computing FFO, the computation of FFO may vary from one company to another.\nModified Funds From Operations (\"Modified FFO\")\nModified FFO adds back an adjustment for any above or below-market ground lease amortization to traditionally defined FFO. We consider this a useful supplemental measure in evaluating our operating performance due to the non-cash accounting treatment under GAAP, which stems from the third quarter 2014 acquisition of two option properties following our formation transactions as they carry significantly below market ground leases, the amortization of which is material to our overall results. We present Modified FFO because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance in that it adds back the non-cash amortization of below-market ground leases. There can be no assurance that Modified FFO presented by us is comparable to similarly titled measures of other REITs. Modified FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. Modified FFO is not indicative of cash available to fund ongoing cash needs, including the ability to make cash distributions.\nCore Funds From Operations (\"Core FFO\")\nCore FFO adds back to traditionally defined FFO the following items: acquisition expenses, severance expenses, retirement equity compensation expenses, private perpetual preferred exchange offering expenses, deferred tax asset write-off, loss on early extinguishment of debt, acquisition expenses, gain on settlement of lawsuit related to the Observatory, net of income taxes, ground lease amortization, construction severance expenses and acquisition break-up fee. The Company presents Core FFO because it considers it an important supplemental measure of its operating performance in that it excludes items associated with its IPO and formation transactions and other non-recurring items. There can be no assurance that Core FFO presented by the Company is comparable to similarly titled measures of other REITs. Core FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. Core FFO is not indicative of cash available to fund ongoing cash needs, including the ability to make cash distributions. In future periods, we may also exclude other items from Core FFO that we believe may help investors compare our results.\nThe following"}
