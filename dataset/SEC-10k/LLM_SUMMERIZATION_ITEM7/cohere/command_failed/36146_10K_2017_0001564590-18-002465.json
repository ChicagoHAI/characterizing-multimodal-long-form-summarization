This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the supplemental financial data included in Part II. Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.\nExecutive Overview\nTrustmark continued to achieve solid financial results with total revenue of $148.0 million and $592.2 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively. Trustmark continued to maintain and expand customer relationships as reflected by growth across all five market regions in the LHFI portfolio, which increased $718.8 million, or 9.2%, during year ended December 31, 2017. During the first quarter of 2017, Trustmark reclassified $36.7 million of acquired loans not accounted for under FASB ASC Topic 310-30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality\u201d to LHFI due to the discount on these loans being fully amortized. Excluding the reclassified acquired loans, LHFI increased $682.0 million, or 8.7%, during 2017. Credit quality remained strong and continued to be an important contributor to Trustmark's financial success. Trustmark is committed to investments to support profitable revenue growth as well as reengineering and efficiency opportunities to enhance shareholder value. Trustmark's capital position remained solid, reflecting the consistent profitability of its diversified financial services businesses. Trustmark's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share. The dividend is payable March 15, 2018, to shareholders of record on March 1, 2018.\nDuring August 2017, the Texas Gulf Coast region was severely impacted by Hurricane Harvey. None of Trustmark's banking facilities in its Texas market region sustained damage, and all were able to reopen as soon as practical following the storm. In the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, Trustmark initiated a process to assess the storm's impact on its customers. Trustmark identified all loans where the collateral, project or mailing addresses were located within Federal Emergency Management Association (FEMA) designated disaster zip codes and proactively surveyed these customers to determine the extent of any damages. Potential loss exposure was calculated based upon customer responses as to the extent of damage suffered and applicable insurance coverage. As a result, Trustmark increased its allowance for loan losses for LHFI during the third quarter of 2017 by $1.1 million due to the potential loss exposure caused by Hurricane Harvey.\nOn April 7, 2017, Trustmark completed its previously announced merger with RB Bancorporation (Reliance). Reliance was the holding company for Reliance Bank, which had seven offices serving the Huntsville, Alabama metropolitan service area in northern Alabama. Reliance Bank was merged into TNB simultaneously with the merger of Trustmark and Reliance. Under the terms of the merger agreement dated November 14, 2016, Trustmark paid $22.00 in cash for each share of Reliance common stock outstanding, which represented payment to Reliance common shareholders of approximately $23.7 million. In addition, Trustmark paid off Reliance preferred stock of $1.1 million bringing the total consideration paid to $24.8 million. The operations of Reliance are included in Trustmark's operating results from April 7, 2017 and did not have a material impact on Trustmark's results of operations. During the second quarter of 2017, Trustmark included non-routine merger transaction expenses in other expense totaling $3.2 million.\nAs previously reported, on July 26, 2016, the Board of Directors of Trustmark authorized the termination of the Trustmark Capital Accumulation Plan (the Plan), a noncontributory tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan, effective as of December 31, 2016. The final distributions were made from current plan assets and a one-time pension settlement expense of $17.6 million was recognized when paid by Trustmark during the second quarter of 2017.\nFinancial Highlights\nTrustmark reported net income of $15.8 million, or basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.23, in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $28.9 million, or basic and diluted EPS of $0.43, in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in net income when the fourth quarter of 2017 is compared to the same time period in 2016 was principally due to an one-time charge to income taxes resulting from the re-measurement of Trustmark's net deferred tax assets due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Reform Act) and the elimination of a deferred tax valuation allowance related to a prior merger, which collectively reduced net income by $17.0 million, or $0.25 per diluted share. Excluding these non-routine transactions, net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $32.7 million, or diluted EPS of $0.48. The increase in net income, excluding the non-routine transactions, when the fourth quarter of 2017 is compared to the same time period in 2016 was principally due to an increase in total revenue (primarily due to increases in interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI, mortgage banking, net and other income, net principally as a result of proceeds received related to bank-owned life insurance) partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense. These factors are discussed in greater detail below. Trustmark's reported performance during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, produced a return on average tangible equity of 5.60%, a return on average assets of 0.45%, an average equity to average assets ratio of 11.40% and a dividend payout ratio of 100.00%, compared to a return on average tangible equity of 10.41%, a return on average assets of 0.87%, an average\nequity to average assets ratio of 11.63% and a dividend payout ratio of 53.49% during the quarter ended December 31, 2016. For a reconciliation between the reported net income and the net income adjusted for significant non-routine transactions as well as select financial ratios, please see the section captioned Significant Non-routine Transactions.\u201d\nRevenue, which is defined as net interest income plus noninterest income, totaled $148.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to $140.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $7.4 million, or 5.3%. The increase in total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was principally the result of increases in interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI, mortgage banking, net and other income, net, partially offset by an increase in total interest expense.\nInterest and fees on LHFS and LHFI increased $14.0 million, or 18.2%, when the fourth quarter of 2017 is compared to the same time period in 2016, primarily due to an increase in the LHFI portfolio and higher interest rates. LHFI totaled $8.570 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $718.8 million, or 9.2%, when compared to December 31, 2016, as a result of net growth across all of Trustmark's market regions and all categories in its LHFI portfolio. Mortgage banking, net for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $856 thousand, or 15.8%, when compared to the same time period in 2016, principally due to a decrease in the net negative mortgage valuation adjustment, partially offset by a decline in gain on sales of loans, net. Other income, net for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased $589 thousand, or 28.2%, when compared to the same time period in 2016 primarily due to non-taxable proceeds of $1.7 million related to bank-owned life insurance received during the fourth quarter of 2017. Interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $6.4 million, or 98.9%, when compared to the same time period in 2016 principally due to rising interest rates in general, which result in increases in interest on deposits and other interest expense. Interest expense on deposits for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased $3.9 million when compared to the same time period in 2016, principally due to rising interest rates in general, accompanied by increases in average balances of all categories of interest-bearing accounts. Other interest expense increased $1.9 million, or 71.1%, when the fourth quarter of 2017 is compared to the same time period in 2016, principally due to increases in rates in general and average balances of short-term FHLB advances partially offset by the decline in interest expense on the subordinated notes.\nTrustmark's provision for loan losses, LHFI for the three months ended December 31, 2017 totaled $5.7 million, an increase of $3.9 million when compared to a provision for loan losses, LHFI of $1.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in the provision for loan losses, LHFI for the fourth quarter of 2017 when compared to the same time period in 2016 was primarily due to an increase in the amount of provision required for existing and newly impaired LHFI, primarily in the Texas and Mississippi market regions, and an increase in the amount of provision related to quantitative reserve factors. Please see the section captioned Provision for Loan Losses, LHFI,\u201d for additional information regarding the provision for loan losses, LHFI. The provision for loan losses, acquired loans for the three months ended December 31, 2017 totaled a negative $1.6 million, a decrease of $2.7 million when compared to the same time period in 2016 principally due to changes in expectations based on the periodic re-estimations performed during the respective periods and a decline in acquired loan balances. Please see the section captioned Provision for Loan Losses, Acquired Loans,\u201d for additional information regarding the provision for loan losses, acquired loans. In total, the provision for loan losses, net was $4.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $1.2 million, or 39.6%, when compared to the same time period in 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, Trustmark reported net income of $105.6 million, or basic and diluted EPS of $1.56, compared to $108.4 million, or basic and diluted EPS of $1.60, for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $116.0 million, or basic and diluted EPS of $1.72 and $1.71, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in net income when 2017 is compared to 2016 was primarily due to increases in income taxes and noninterest expense (principally due to non-routine transaction expenses), which was partially offset by an increase in total revenue (primarily due to increases in interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI and other income, net principally as a result of proceeds received related to life insurance) and the decline in the provision for loan losses, acquired loans. These factors are discussed in greater detail below. During the fourth quarter of 2017, Trustmark incurred non-routine income tax expenses of $17.0 million related to the re-measurement of Trustmark's net deferred tax assets due to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act and the elimination of a deferred tax valuation allowance related to a prior merger. During the second quarter of 2017, Trustmark received $4.9 million in non-routine, nontaxable proceeds related to life insurance acquired in a previous acquisition. Additionally, Trustmark incurred non-routine transaction expenses of $17.6 million related to the termination of the defined benefit pension plan and $3.2 million related to the completion of the Reliance merger during the second quarter of 2017. Excluding these non-routine transactions, net income for 2017 totaled $130.6 million, or diluted EPS of $1.92. Trustmark's reported performance for the year ended December 31, 2017, produced a return on average tangible equity of 9.39%, a return on average assets of 0.77% and a dividend payout ratio of 58.97%, compared to a return on average tangible equity of 9.99%, a return on average assets of 0.84% and a dividend payout ratio of 57.50% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and a return on average tangible equity of 11.36%, a return on average assets of 0.95% and a dividend payout ratio of 53.49% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Trustmark's average equity to average assets ratio was 11.38%, 11.73% and 11.90% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For a reconciliation between the reported net income and the net income adjusted for significant non-routine transactions as well as select financial ratios, please see the section captioned Significant Non-routine Transactions.\u201d\nRevenue totaled $592.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $561.5 million and $564.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in total revenue for 2017 compared to 2016 was principally the result of increases in interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI and other income, net partially offset by an increase in total interest expense.\nInterest and fees on LHFS and LHFI for 2017 increased $45.0 million, or 15.0%, compared to 2016, primarily due to the year-over-year increase in the LHFI portfolio. Other income, net for 2017 increased $8.3 million when compared to 2016 primarily due to non-taxable proceeds of $4.4 million related to bank-owned life insurance received during 2017 and the $4.9 million in non-routine, non-taxable proceeds related to life insurance acquired in a previous acquisition received during the second quarter of 2017. Interest expense for 2017 increased $17.7 million, or 72.1%, when compared to 2016 due to rising interest rates in general. Interest expense on deposits for 2017 increased $10.0 million, or 78.2%, when compared to 2016, principally due to rising rates in general, accompanied by increases in average balances of all categories of interest-bearing deposits. Interest on federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements increased $2.4 million when 2017 is compared to 2016 principally due to increases in the target range for the federal funds rate by the FRB. Other interest expense increased $5.3 million, or 52.5%, when the year ended December 31, 2017 is compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, principally due to increases in rates in general, accompanied by increases in average balances of short-term FHLB advances partially offset by the decline in interest expense on the subordinated notes.\nTrustmark's provision for loan losses, LHFI, for 2017 totaled $15.1 million, an increase of $4.1 million, or 37.8%, when compared to a provision for loan losses, LHFI of $11.0 million for 2016. The increase in the provision for loan losses, LHFI for 2017 when compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in the amount of provision required related to existing and newly impaired LHFI, and the $1.1 million of additional reserves due to the potential loss exposure caused by Hurricane Harvey. Please see the section captioned Provision for Loan Losses, LHFI,\u201d for additional information regarding the provision for loan losses, LHFI. The provision for loan losses, acquired loans for 2017 totaled a negative $7.4 million, a decrease of $11.2 million when compared to 2016 principally due to changes in expectations based on the periodic re-estimations performed during the respective periods and a decline in acquired loan balances. Please see the section captioned Provision for Loan Losses, Acquired Loans,\u201d for additional information regarding the provision for loan losses, acquired loans. In total, the provision for loan losses, net was $7.7 million for 2017, a decrease of $7.0 million, or 47.7%, when compared to 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, nonperforming assets, excluding acquired loans, totaled $110.8 million, a decrease of $482 thousand, or 0.4%, compared to December 31, 2016 due to a decline in other real estate, which was largely offset by an increase in nonaccrual LHFI. Total nonaccrual LHFI were $67.6 million at December 31, 2017, representing an increase of $18.3 million, or 37.3%, relative to December 31, 2016 principally due to three large substandard credits moving to nonaccrual status during 2017. The percentage of loans, excluding acquired loans, that are 30 days or more past due and nonaccrual LHFI increased in 2017 to 1.53% compared to 1.33% in 2016 and 1.44% in 2015. Other real estate declined $18.8 million, or 30.3%, during 2017 primarily due to properties sold in all five market of Trustmark's market regions as well as write-downs of properties in Trustmark's Mississippi, Florida and Alabama market regions partially offset by properties foreclosed in all five market regions.\nLHFI totaled $8.570 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $718.8 million, or 9.2%, compared to December 31, 2016. During the first quarter of 2017, Trustmark reclassified $36.7 million of acquired loans not accounted for under FASB ASC Topic 310-30 to LHFI due to the discount on these loans being fully amortized. Excluding the reclassified acquired loans, LHFI increased $682.0 million, or 8.7%, during 2017. The increase in LHFI, excluding the reclassified acquired loans, during 2017 represented net growth across all five of Trustmark's market regions and all loan categories. For additional information regarding changes in LHFI and comparative balances by loan category, see the section captioned LHFI.\u201d\nBoth classified and criticized LHFI balances remain at low levels and continue to reflect strong credit quality. As of December 31, 2017, classified LHFI balances decreased $13.9 million, or 6.2%, while criticized LHFI balances decreased $602 thousand, or 0.2%, when compared to balances at December 31, 2016. All of the credits have been appropriately reserved.\nManagement has continued its practice of maintaining excess funding capacity to provide Trustmark with adequate liquidity for its ongoing operations. In this regard, Trustmark benefits from its strong deposit base, its highly liquid investment portfolio and its access to funding from a variety of external funding sources such as upstream federal funds lines, FHLB advances and, on a limited basis, brokered deposits.\nTotal deposits were $10.578 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $521.5 million, or 5.2% compared to December 31, 2016, primarily due to growth in interest-bearing deposits. During 2017, noninterest-bearing deposits increased $4.8 million, or 0.2%, primarily due to growth in consumer and public demand deposit accounts, which were largely offset by a decline in commercial demand deposit accounts, while interest-bearing deposits increased $516.7 million, or 7.3%, primarily due to growth in all categories of interest-bearing demand deposit accounts with the exception of public interest checking and money market accounts, reflecting the Reliance merger and increases in interest rates. At December 31, 2017, the balance of deposits for branches associated with the\nReliance merger was $163.6 million. Excluding these Reliance deposits, total deposits at December 31, 2017 increased $357.9 million, or 3.6%.\nTrustmark uses short-term borrowings to fund growth of earning assets in excess of deposits growth. Short-term borrowings totaled $1.441 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $131.3 million, or 10.0%, when compared to December 31, 2016 as a result of the increase in earning assets, principally LHFI, out-pacing the growth in deposits. The increase in short-term borrowings was primarily due to an increase in the outstanding balance of short-term FHLB advances as Trustmark continues to utilize this funding source to fund the difference between loan and deposit growth. Short-term FHLB advances increased $200.0 million during 2017 as a result of a $450.0 million increase in outstanding short-term advances with the FHLB of Dallas as well as the $250.0 million long-term FHLB advance with the FHLB of Dallas which was reclassified to short-term in May 2017 partially offset by the $500.0 million advance with the FHLB of Dallas that matured in December 2017.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nTrustmark's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and follow general practices within the financial services industry. Application of these accounting principles requires Management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, actual financial results could differ from those estimates.\nCertain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. These critical accounting policies are described below.\nFor additional information regarding the accounting policies discussed below, please see Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies set forth in Part II. Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.\nAllowance for Loan Losses, LHFI\nThe allowance for loan losses, LHFI is established through provisions for estimated loan losses charged against net income. The allowance reflects Management's best estimate of the probable loan losses related to specifically identified LHFI as well as probable incurred loan losses in the remaining loan portfolio and requires considerable judgment. The allowance is based upon Management's current judgments about the credit quality of the loan portfolio, including all internal and external factors that impact loan collectibility. Accordingly, the allowance is based upon both past events and current economic conditions.\nA significant shift in one or more factors included in the allowance for loan loss methodology could result in a material change to Trustmark's allowance for loan losses, LHFI. For example, if there were changes in one or more of the estimates, assumptions or judgments used as they relate to a portfolio of commercial LHFI, Trustmark could find that it needs to increase the level of future provisions for possible loan losses with respect to that portfolio. Additionally, credit deterioration of specific borrowers due to changes in these factors could cause the internally assigned risk rating to shift to a more severe category. As a result, Trustmark could find that it needs to increase the level of future provisions for possible loan losses with respect to these LHFI. Given the nature of many of these estimates, assumptions and judgments, it is not possible to provide meaningful estimates of the impact of any such potential shifts.\nFor a complete description of Trustmark's allowance for loan loss methodology, please see Note 5 - LHFI and Allowance for Loan Losses, LHFI included in Part II. Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.\nAcquired Loans\nAcquired loans are recorded at their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date. The fair value of acquired loans is determined using a discounted cash flow model based on assumptions regarding the amount and timing of principal and interest payments, estimated prepayments, estimated default rates, estimated loss severity in the event of defaults, and current market rates. Estimated credit losses are included in the determination of fair value; therefore, an allowance for loan losses is not recorded on the acquisition date.\nFor acquired impaired loans, Trustmark (i) calculates the contractual amount and timing of undiscounted principal and interest payments (the undiscounted contractual cash flows) and (ii) estimates the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal and interest payments (the undiscounted expected cash flows). Under FASB ASC Topic 310-30 the difference between the undiscounted contractual cash flows and the undiscounted expected cash flows is the nonaccretable difference. The nonaccretable difference represents an estimate of the loss exposure of principal and interest related to the acquired impaired loan portfolio, and such amount is\nsubject to change over time based on the performance of such loans. The excess of undiscounted expected cash flows at acquisition over the initial fair value of acquired impaired loans is referred to as the accretable yield\u201d and is recorded as interest income over the estimated life of the loans using the effective yield method if the timing and amount of the future cash flows is reasonably estimable. Under the effective yield method, the accretable yield is recorded as an accretion of interest income over the life of the loan.\nAs required by FASB ASC Topic 310-30, Trustmark periodically re-estimates the expected cash flows to be collected over the life of the acquired impaired loans. If, based on current information and events, it is probable that Trustmark will be unable to collect all cash flows expected at acquisition plus additional cash flows expected to be collected arising from changes in estimate after acquisition, the acquired loans are considered impaired. The decrease in the expected cash flows reduces the carrying value of the acquired impaired loans as well as the accretable yield and results in a charge-off through the allowance for loan losses, acquired loans or the establishment of an allowance for loan losses, acquired loans with a charge to income through the provision for loan losses, acquired loans. If, based on current information and events, it is probable that there is a significant increase in the cash flows previously expected to be collected or if actual cash flows are significantly greater than cash flows previously expected, Trustmark will reduce any remaining allowance for loan losses, acquired loans established on the acquired impaired loans for the increase in the present value of cash flows expected to be collected. The increase in the expected cash flows for the acquired impaired loans over those originally estimated at acquisition increases the carrying value of the acquired impaired loans as well as the accretable yield.\nMortgage Servicing Rights (MSR)\nTrustmark recognizes as assets the rights to service mortgage loans based on the estimated fair value of the MSR when loans are sold and the associated servicing rights are retained. Trustmark has elected to account for the MSR at fair value.\nThe fair value of the MSR is determined using a valuation model administered by a third party that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The model incorporates assumptions that market participants use in estimating future net servicing income, including estimates of prepayment speeds, discount rate, default rates, cost to service (including delinquency and foreclosure costs), escrow account earnings, contractual servicing fee income and other ancillary income such as late fees. Management reviews all significant assumptions quarterly. Mortgage loan prepayment speeds, a key assumption in the model, is the annual rate at which borrowers are forecasted to repay their mortgage loan principal. The discount rate used to determine the present value of estimated future net servicing income, another key assumption in the model, is an estimate of the required rate of return investors in the market would require for an asset with similar risk. Both assumptions can, and generally will, change as market conditions and interest rates change.\nBy way of example, an increase in either the prepayment speed or discount rate assumption will result in a decrease in the fair value of the MSR, while a decrease in either assumption will result in an increase in the fair value of the MSR. In recent years, there have been significant market-driven fluctuations in loan prepayment speeds and discount rates. These fluctuations can be rapid and may continue to be significant. Therefore, estimating prepayment speed and/or discount rates within ranges that market participants would use in determining the fair value of the MSR requires significant management judgment.\nAt December 31, 2017, the MSR fair value was approximately $84.3 million. The impact on the MSR fair value of either a 10% adverse change in prepayment speeds or a 100 basis point increase in discount rates at December 31, 2017, would be a decline in fair value of approximately $3.1 million. Changes of equal magnitude in the opposite direction would produce similar increases in fair value in the respective amounts.\nGoodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets\nTrustmark records all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions, including goodwill and other intangible assets, at fair value as required by FASB ASC Topic 805. The carrying amount of goodwill at December 31, 2017 totaled $334.6 million for the General Banking Division and $45.0 million for the Insurance Division, a consolidated total of $379.6 million. Trustmark's goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual tests for impairment or more often if events or circumstances indicate it may be impaired. Trustmark's identifiable intangible assets, which totaled $16.4 million at December 31, 2017, are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are subject to impairment tests if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount.\nThe initial recording and subsequent impairment testing of goodwill requires subjective judgments concerning estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets. The goodwill impairment test is performed in two phases. The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired; however, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an additional procedure must be performed. That additional procedure, or a second step, compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. An impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. Trustmark performed an annual impairment test of goodwill for reporting units contained in both the General Banking and Insurance Divisions as of October 1, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, which\nindicated that no impairment charge was required. The impairment test for the General Banking Division utilized valuations based on comparable deal values for financial institutions while the test for the Insurance Division utilizes varying valuation scenarios for the multiple of earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization method based on recent acquisition activity. Based on this analysis, Trustmark concluded that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value for both the General Banking Division and the Insurance Division; therefore, no impairment charge was required. Significant changes in future profitability and value of our reporting units could affect Trustmark's impairment evaluation.\nThe carrying amount of Trustmark's identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition. That assessment shall be based on the carrying amount of the intangible assets subject to amortization at the date it is tested for recoverability. Intangible assets subject to amortization shall be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nFair value may be determined using market prices, comparison to similar assets, market multiples and other determinants. Factors that may significantly affect the estimates include, among others, competitive forces, customer behavior and attrition, changes in revenue growth trends and specific industry or market sector conditions. Other key judgments in accounting for intangibles include determining the useful life of the particular asset and classifying assets as either goodwill (which does not require amortization) or identifiable intangible assets (which does require amortization).\nOther Real Estate\nOther real estate includes assets that have been acquired in satisfaction of debt through foreclosure and is carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less the estimated cost of disposition. Fair value is based on independent appraisals and other relevant factors. Valuation adjustments required at foreclosure are charged to the allowance for loan losses. Other real estate is revalued on an annual basis or more often if market conditions necessitate. An other real estate specific reserve may be recorded through other real estate expense for declines in fair value subsequent to foreclosure based on recent appraisals or changes in market conditions. Subsequent to foreclosure, losses on the periodic revaluation of the property are charged against a reserve specific to other real estate or to noninterest expense in other real estate expense if a reserve does not exist. Significant judgments and complex estimates are required in estimating the fair value of other real estate, and the period of time within which such estimates can be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of market volatility. As a result, the net proceeds realized from sales transactions could differ significantly from appraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates used to determine the fair value of other real estate.\nDefined Benefit Plans\nTrustmark's plan assets, projected benefit liabilities and cost are determined utilizing actuarially-determined present value calculations. The valuation of the projected benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost for the Trustmark Corporation Pension Plan for certain Employees of Acquired Financial Institutions (the Continuing Plan) and Trustmark's nonqualified supplemental retirement plans requires Management to make estimates regarding the amount and timing of expected cash outflows. Several variables affect these calculations, including (i) size and characteristics of the participant population, (ii) discount rate, (iii) expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and (iv) recognition of actual returns on plan assets. Below is a brief description of the variables that introduce material uncertainty into Management's estimates and the effect they have on estimated benefit cost.\nTable 54: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Population and Characteristics of Participants. Benefit cost is directly related to the number of participants covered by the plan and characteristics such as salary, age, years of service and benefit terms. At December 31, 2017, the census for Trustmark's plans totaled 124 participants.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 55: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Discount Rate. The discount rate utilized in determining the present value of the future benefit obligation was 3.32% at December 31, 2017 (as compared to 3.71% at December 31, 2016). The discount rate for the plans is determined by matching the expected cash flows of the plans to a yield curve based on long term, high quality fixed income debt instruments available as of the measurement date (December 31, 2017). The discount rate is reset annually on the measurement date to reflect current economic conditions. If Trustmark assumes a 1.00% increase or decrease in the discount rate for Trustmark's plans and kept all other assumptions constant, the benefit cost associated with Trustmark's plans would decrease or increase by approximately $281 thousand and $314 thousand, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets. Based on historical experience and market projection of the target asset allocation set forth in the investment policy for the Continuing Plan, the pre-tax expected rate of return on the plan assets used in 2017 was 5.00%, versus 6.00% for the first half of the year and 2.50% thereafter in 2016 as a result of Trustmark's de-risking investment strategy. This expected rate of return is dependent upon the asset allocation decisions made with respect to plan assets. Annual differences, if any, between expected and actual return are included in the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss amount. Trustmark generally amortizes any cumulative unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in excess of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets.

To estimate the projected benefit obligation, actuarial assumptions are required to be made by Management, including mortality rate, retirement rate, disability rate and the rate of compensation increases.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContingent Liabilities\nTrustmark estimates contingent liabilities based on Management's evaluation of the probability of outcomes and their ability to estimate the range of exposure. As stated in FASB ASC Topic 450, Contingencies,\u201d a liability is contingent if the amount is not presently known but may become known in the future as a result of the occurrence of some uncertain future event. Accounting standards require that a liability be recorded if Management determines that it is probable that a loss has occurred, and the loss can be reasonably estimated. It is implicit in this standard that it must be probable that the loss will be confirmed by some future event. As part of the estimation process, Management is required to make assumptions about matters that are, by their nature, highly uncertain. The assessment of contingent liabilities, including legal contingencies and income tax liabilities, involves the use of critical estimates, assumptions and judgments. Management's estimates are based on their belief that future events will validate the current assumptions regarding the ultimate outcome of these exposures. However, there can be no assurance that future events, such as court decisions or Internal Revenue Service (IRS) positions, will not differ from Management's assessments. Whenever practicable, Management consults with outside experts (attorneys, consultants, claims administrators, etc.) to assist with the gathering and evaluation of information related to contingent liabilities.\nRecent Legislative and Regulatory Developments\nFor information regarding legislation and regulation applicable to Trustmark, see the section captioned Supervision and Regulation\u201d included in Part I. Item 1. - Business of this report.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to capital ratios defined by GAAP and banking regulators, Trustmark utilizes various tangible common equity measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy. Tangible common equity, as defined by Trustmark, represents common equity less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets.\nTrustmark believes these measures are important because they reflect the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation of these measures allows readers to compare certain aspects of Trustmark's capitalization to other organizations. These ratios differ from capital measures defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes shareholders' equity associated with preferred securities, the nature and extent of which varies across organizations. In Management's experience, many stock analysts use tangible common equity measures in conjunction with more traditional bank capital ratios to compare capital adequacy of banking organizations with significant amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets, typically stemming from the use of the purchase accounting method in accounting for mergers and acquisitions.\nThese calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by GAAP and banking regulators. Because GAAP does not include these capital ratio measures, Trustmark believes there are no comparable GAAP financial measures to these tangible common equity ratios. Despite the importance of these measures to Trustmark, there are no standardized definitions for them and, as a result, Trustmark's calculations may not be comparable with other organizations. Also, there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, Trustmark encourages readers to consider its audited consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nThe following table reconciles Trustmark's calculation of these measures to amounts reported under GAAP for the periods presented ($ in thousands, except per share data):\nTable 59: <table>

Transactions\nTrustmark discloses certain non-GAAP financial measures, including net income adjusted for significant non-routine transactions, because Management uses these measures for business planning purposes, including to manage Trustmark's business against internal projected results of operations and to measure Trustmark's performance. Trustmark views net income adjusted for significant non-routine transactions as a measure of its core operating business, which excludes the impact of the items detailed below, as these items are generally not operational in nature. This non-GAAP measure also provides another basis for comparing period-to-period results as presented in the accompanying selected financial data table and the audited consolidated financial statements by excluding potential differences caused by non-operational and unusual or non-recurring items. Readers are cautioned that these adjustments are not permitted under GAAP. Trustmark encourages readers to consider its audited consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto, included in Part II. Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report, in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nThe following table presents adjustments to net income and

</tr>\n</table>\nRe-measurement of Net Deferred Taxes\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, Trustmark re-measured its net deferred tax assets subsequent to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act which resulted in the reduction of the corporate federal income tax rate. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes,\u201d Trustmark recorded a one-time increase in deferred income tax expense of $25.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nElimination of Deferred Tax Valuation Allowance\nDuring 2013, a deferred tax valuation allowance was created as a result of Trustmark's merger with BancTrust Financial Group, Inc. (BancTrust) and was established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that was more likely than not to be realized in future years. Trustmark has continually evaluated this allowance since inception and, based on the weight of the available evidence, has determined that the deferred tax assets will not be subject to the limitations of Internal Revenue Code, Section 382 on the deductibility of built-in losses in future years. During the fourth quarter of 2017, Trustmark eliminated the valuation allowance and recorded a one-time decrease in deferred income tax expense of $8.7 million.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plan Termination Expense\nAs previously reported, on July 26, 2016, the Board of Directors of Trustmark authorized the termination of the Plan, a noncontributory tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan, effective as of December 31, 2016. The final distributions were made from current plan assets and a one-time pension settlement expense of $17.6 million, before taxes, which is included in noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nReliance Merger Transaction Expenses\nOn April 7, 2017, Trustmark completed its previously announced merger with Reliance. The operations of Reliance are included in Trustmark's operating results from April 7, 2017 and did not have a material impact on Trustmark's results of operations. During the second quarter of 2017, Trustmark included non-routine merger transaction expenses in other expense totaling $3.2 million, before tax.\nNon-taxable Gain on Acquired Life Insurance Proceeds\nDuring the second quarter of 2017, Trustmark received non-routine, non-taxable proceeds related to life insurance acquired in a previous acquisition. Included in other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2017 were non-routine, non-taxable proceeds of $4.9 million.\nEarly Retirement Program Expense\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, Trustmark completed a voluntary early retirement program (ERP) as a proactive measure to manage noninterest expense. Included in noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 were non-routine expenses related to the ERP totaling $9.8 million, before taxes, ($9.6 million included in salaries and employee benefits expense and $213 thousand included in other expense).\nPension Expense Due to De-risking Strategy in Plan Assets Portfolio\nOn July 26, 2016, the Board of Directors of Trustmark authorized the termination of the Plan effective December 31, 2016. As a result of Trustmark's de-risking investment strategy for the Plan as of June 30, 2016, the expected rate of return on plan assets during the second half of 2016 decreased from 6.0% to 2.5%, which resulted in increased periodic benefit costs for the Plan. Included in salaries and employee benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2016, were non-routine pension expenses related to the de-risking investment strategy for the plan assets totaling $1.3 million, before tax.\nResults of Operations\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is the principal component of Trustmark's income stream and represents the difference, or spread, between interest and fee income generated from earning assets and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds. Fluctuations in interest rates, as well as volume and mix changes in earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, can materially impact net interest income. The net interest margin is computed by dividing fully taxable equivalent (FTE) net interest income by average interest-earning assets and measures how effectively Trustmark utilizes its interest-earning assets in relationship to the interest cost of funding them. The accompanying Yield/Rate Analysis Table shows the average balances for all assets and liabilities of Trustmark and the interest income or expense associated with earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The yields and rates have been computed based upon interest income and expense adjusted to a FTE basis using a 35.0% federal marginal tax rate for all periods shown. Loans on nonaccrual have been included in the average loan balances, and interest collected prior to these loans having been placed on nonaccrual has been included in interest income. Loan fees included in interest associated with the average loan balances are immaterial.\nNet interest income-FTE for 2017 increased $21.5 million, or 5.3%, when compared with 2016. The net interest margin decreased 5 basis points to 3.48% for 2017 when compared to 2016. The decrease in the net interest margin was primarily the result of increases in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities in conjunction with rising rates in general, partially offset by an increase in the yield on LHFS and LHFI. The net interest margin excluding acquired loans, which equals the reported net interest income-FTE excluding interest and fees on acquired loans, as a percentage of average earning assets excluding average acquired loans, for 2017 was 3.36%, a decrease of 1 basis point when compared to 2016, due to the factors discussed above.\nAverage interest-earning assets for 2017 were $12.274 billion compared to $11.485 billion for 2016 an increase of $789.1 million, or 6.9%. The growth in average earning assets during 2017 was primarily due to an increase in average loans (LHFS and LHFI) of $820.5 million, or 10.8%, partially offset by a decrease in average acquired loans of $46.8 million, or 14.1%. The increase in average loans (LHFS and LHFI) was primarily attributable to the $718.8 million, or 9.2%, increase in the LHFI portfolio when balances at December 31, 2017 are compared to balances at December 31, 2016. This increase represented net growth across all of Trustmark's market regions and all categories in its LHFI portfolio. The decline in average acquired loans during 2017 was primarily attributable to anticipated pay-offs of acquired loans, principally related to the BancTrust merger, as well as the reclassification of $36.7 million of acquired loans not accounted for under FASB ASC Topic 310-30 to LHFI due to the discount on these loans being fully amortized, partially offset by the loans acquired in the Reliance merger.\nDuring 2017, interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI-FTE increased $46.8 million, or 14.8%, when compared to 2016, due to growth in LHFI, while the yield on loans (LHFS and LHFI) increased 15 basis points to 4.31% as a result of increases in interest rates. During 2017, interest and fees on acquired loans decreased $5.7 million, or 18.8%, compared to 2016, due to declines in recoveries on settlement of debt and accretion income, primarily related to loans acquired in the BancTrust merger, as acquired loans continue to pay-down as anticipated, partially offset by interest and fees on loans acquired in the Reliance merger. As a result, the yield on acquired loans decreased 50 basis points to 8.59% when 2017 is compared to 2016. During 2017, interest on securities decreased $2.5 million, or 3.0%, and the yield on securities declined 8 basis points to 2.31%, compared to 2016, principally due to calls, maturities\nand pay-downs of the underlying loans of higher yielding securities being replaced with lower yielding securities as well as a decline in the yield maintenance payments on prepaid mortgage-backed securities. As a result of these factors, interest income-FTE increased $39.2 million, or 9.1%, when 2017 is compared to 2016, while the yield on total earning assets increased 8 basis points to 3.83%.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities for 2017 totaled $8.963 billion compared to $8.281 billion for 2016, an increase of $682.1 million, or 8.2%. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities was principally due to increases in average short-term borrowings and interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a decline in average long-term FHLB advances. Average short-term borrowings for 2017 increased $768.3 million when compared to 2016, principally due to the increased balance in outstanding short-term FHLB advances with the FHLB of Dallas. Average interest-bearing deposits for 2017 increased $481.3 million, or 7.2%, when compared to 2016 principally due to growth in all categories of interest-bearing deposits as well as the deposits acquired in the Reliance merger. Average long-term FHLB advances decreased $536.7 million, or 84.6%, during 2017, primarily due to the $500.0 million long-term FHLB advance obtained from the FHLB of Dallas that was reclassified to short-term during December 2016 and the $250.0 million long-term FHLB advance obtained from the FHLB of Dallas during May 2016 that was reclassified to short-term in May 2017.\nTotal interest expense for 2017 increased $17.7 million, or 72.1%, when compared with 2016, principally due to rising interest rates in general. Interest expense on deposits for 2017 increased $10.0 million, or 78.2%, when compared to 2016, principally due to rising rates in general, accompanied by increases in average balances of all categories of interest-bearing deposits. The rate on interest-bearing deposits increased 13 basis points to 0.32% for 2017 compared to 0.19% for 2016. Interest on federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements increased $2.4 million while the rate increased 46 basis points to 0.81% when 2017 is compared to 2016 principally due to increases in the target range for the federal funds rate by the FRB. Other interest expense increased $5.3 million, or 52.5%, while the rate on other borrowings increased 27 basis points to 1.18% when the year ended December 31, 2017 is compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, principally due to increases in rates in general, accompanied by increases in average balances of short-term FHLB advances partially offset by the decline in interest expense on the subordinated notes which matured in December 2016. As a result of these factors, the overall rate on interest-bearing liabilities increased 17 basis points to 0.47% when 2017 is compared with 2016.\nNet interest income-FTE for 2016 decreased $2.3 million, or 0.6%, when compared with 2015. The net interest margin decreased 25 basis points to 3.53% for 2016 when compared to 2015. The decrease in the net interest margin reflected the prolonged low interest rate environment in the United States, and was primarily the result of decreases in the yield on acquired loans principally due to declines in accretion income and recoveries on settlement of debt related to acquired loans, downward repricing of LHFI in response to increased competitive pricing pressures and decreases in the yield on taxable securities. The net interest margin excluding acquired loans, which equals the reported net interest income-FTE excluding interest and fees on acquired loans, as a percentage of average earning assets excluding average acquired loans, for 2016 was 3.37%, a decrease of 9 basis points when compared to 2015, due to similar factors as discussed above.\nAverage interest-earning assets for 2016 were $11.485 billion compared to $10.791 billion for 2015 an increase of $693.4 million, or 6.4%. The growth in average earning assets during 2016 was primarily due to an increase in average loans (LHFS and LHFI) of $846.3 million, or 12.5%, partially offset by a decrease in average acquired loans of $130.9 million, or 28.3% and a decline in average total securities of $38.7 million, or 1.1%. The increase in average loans (LHFS and LHFI) was primarily attributable to the $759.8 million, or 10.7%, increase in the LHFI portfolio when balances at December 31, 2016 are compared to balances at December 31, 2015. This increase represented net growth across all of Trustmark's market regions and all categories in its LHFI portfolio, with the exception of other loans. The decline in average acquired loans during 2016 was primarily attributable to anticipated pay-offs of acquired loans, principally related to the BancTrust merger. The decline in average total securities during 2016 was primarily attributable to calls, maturities and pay-downs of the loans underlying these securities.\nDuring 2016, interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI-FTE increased $27.5 million, or 9.5%, when compared to 2015, due to growth in LHFI, while the yield on loans (LHFS and LHFI) fell 12 basis points to 4.16% as a result of downward repricing of LHFI due to the current interest rate environment and related competitive pressures. During 2016, interest and fees on acquired loans decreased $21.0 million, or 41.1%, compared to 2015, due to declines in accretion income and recoveries on settlement of debt as acquired loans continue to pay-down as anticipated. As a result, the yield on acquired loans decreased to 9.09% compared to 11.06% during 2015. During 2016, interest on securities-taxable decreased $3.1 million, or 3.9%, and the yield on taxable securities declined 8 basis points to 2.31%, compared to 2015, principally due to calls, maturities and pay-downs of the underlying loans of higher yielding securities being replaced with lower yielding securities reflecting the current interest rate environment as well as a decline in the yield maintenance payments on prepaid mortgage-backed securities. As a result of these factors, interest income-FTE increased $1.8 million, or 0.4%, when 2016 is compared to 2015. The impact of these changes is also illustrated by the decline in the yield on total earning assets, which fell from 3.97% for 2015 to 3.75% for 2016, a decrease of 22 basis points.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities for 2016 totaled $8.281 billion compared to $7.890 billion for 2015, an increase of $391.0 million, or 5.0%. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities was attributable to an increase in average long-term FHLB advances partially offset by declines in all other categories of average interest-bearing liabilities. Average long-term FHLB advances increased\n$620.8 million during 2016, primarily due to the $500.0 million long-term FHLB advance obtained from the FHLB of Dallas during December 2015 and the $250.0 million long-term FHLB advance obtained from the FHLB of Dallas during May 2016. Average interest-bearing deposits for 2016 decreased $174.5 million, or 2.5%, when compared to 2015, principally due to declines in average time deposits, reflecting Trustmark's continued efforts to reduce high-cost deposit balances and customers continued movement away from longer-term commitments as a result of the low interest rate environment. Average short-term borrowings decreased $45.1 million, or 10.9%, when 2016 is compared to 2015, which was primarily attributable to a decrease in the amount of short-term FHLB advances obtained from the FHLB of Dallas during 2016 partially offset by the $500.0 million FHLB advance with the FHLB of Dallas that was reclassified from long-term to short-term during December 2016.\nTotal interest expense during 2016 increased $4.1 million, or 20.0%, when compared with 2015, principally due to the increase in other interest expense. Other interest expense increased $3.0 million, or 42.8%, when 2016 is compared to 2015, primarily due to increases in interest expense on long-term FHLB advances and short-term borrowings. Interest expense on long-term FHLB advances increased $2.1 million during 2016, while the rate on long-term FHLB advances decreased 3 basis points to 0.33%, compared to 2015, reflecting the increase in the outstanding long-term FHLB advances with the FHLB of Dallas. Interest expense on short-term borrowings increased $836 thousand, or 29.2%, during 2016 primarily due to a $1.1 million increase in interest expense on short-term FHLB advances, while the rate for short-term borrowings increased 31 basis points to 1.00%. Interest on federal funds purchased and securities sold under reverse repurchase agreements increased $916 thousand when 2016 is compared to 2015, while the rate on federal funds purchased and securities sold under reverse repurchase agreements increased 19 basis points to 0.35%. The increase in the rate on federal funds purchased and securities sold under reverse repurchase agreements during 2016 was principally due to the increase in rates by the FRB. As a result of these factors, the overall yield on interest-bearing liabilities increased 4 basis points to 0.30% when 2016 is compared with 2015.\nThe following table provides the tax equivalent

absolute value of the change in each. Tax-exempt income has been adjusted to a tax equivalent basis using a tax rate of 35.0% for each of the three years presented. The balances of nonaccrual loans and related income recognized have been included for purposes of these computations.\nProvision for Loan Losses, LHFI\nThe provision for loan losses, LHFI is determined by Management as the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for loan losses, LHFI to a level, which, in Management's best estimate, is necessary to absorb probable losses within the existing loan portfolio. The provision for loan losses, LHFI reflects loan quality trends, including the levels of and trends related to nonaccrual LHFI, past due LHFI, potential problem LHFI, criticized LHFI, net charge-offs or recoveries and growth in the LHFI portfolio among other factors. Accordingly, the amount of the provision reflects the necessary increases or decreases in the allowance for loan losses, LHFI related to adjustments for specific loans or loan pools as a result of growth in the portfolio and evaluation of current impairment analyses, actions taken with respect to risk ratings on loans and other adjustments resulting from changes in qualitative factors. The provision for loan losses, LHFI totaled $15.1 million for 2017, $11.0 million for 2016 and $8.4 million for 2015. See the section captioned Allowance for Loan Losses, LHFI\u201d for further analysis of the provision for loan losses, LHFI.\nProvision for Loan Losses, Acquired Loans\nThe provision for loan losses, acquired loans is recognized subsequent to acquisition to the extent it is probable that Trustmark will be unable to collect all cash flows expected at acquisition plus additional cash flows expected to be collected arising from changes in estimates after acquisition, considering both the timing and amount of those expected cash flows. Provisions may be required when actual losses of unpaid principal incurred exceed previous loss expectations to date, or future cash flows previously expected to be collectible are no longer probable of collection. The provision for loan losses, acquired loans is reflected as a valuation allowance\nnetted against the carrying value of the acquired loans. The decrease in the provision for loan losses, acquired loans when 2017 is compared to 2016 was principally due to changes in expectations based on the periodic re-estimations performed during the respective periods and a decline in acquired loan balances. The increase in the provision for loan losses, acquired loans when 2016 is compared to 2015 was principally due to changes in expectations based on the periodic re-estimations performed during the year, primarily related to loans acquired from BancTrust.\nThe following table presents the provision for loan losses, acquired loans, by acquisition for the periods presented ($ in thousands):\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BancTrust\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (6,089\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bay Bank\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,323\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (50\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Heritage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (122\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (336\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (450\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reliance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total provision for loan losses, acquired loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (7,395\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income represented 31.2%, 31.0% and 30.7% of total revenue, before securities gains (losses), net in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

The decline in NSF and overdraft charges on deposit accounts during 2016 was primarily the result of balances in consumer deposit accounts increasing 3.5% during 2016 providing more available funds to complete banking transactions.\nMortgage Banking, Net\nThe following table illustrates the components of mortgage banking, net included in noninterest income for the periods presented ($ in thousands):\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage servicing income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in fair value-MSR from runoff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10,780\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10,106\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,527\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sales of loans, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -7.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 66.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (169\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (84\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -74.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage banking income before hedge\nineffectiveness\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -4.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in fair value-MSR from market changes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,050\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (406\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in fair value of derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,451\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -97.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net hedge ineffectiveness\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,857\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -38.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage banking, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 29,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -6.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 30,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nn/m - percentage changes greater than +/- 100% are not considered meaningful\nThe increase in mortgage banking, net for 2017 when compared to 2016 was principally due to a net positive hedge ineffectiveness for 2017 compared to a net negative hedge ineffectiveness for 2016 and an increase in mortgage servicing income, net, partially offset by a decline in gains on sales of loans, net.

Mortgage loan production decreased $250.8 million, or 15.6%, during 2017 to total $1.355 billion, reflecting the current rising interest rate environment. Mortgage loan production increased $124.2 million, or 8.4%, during 2016 to total $1.606 billion, which continued to reflect increased mortgage lending activity due to low mortgage rates. Loans serviced for others totaled $6.624 billion at December 31, 2017, compared with $6.371 billion at December 31, 2016, and $5.971 billion at December 31, 2015.\nRepresenting a significant component of mortgage banking income is gain on sales of loans, net. The decrease in the gain on sales of loans, net when 2017 is compared to 2016 resulted primarily from a decline in the volume of loans sold partially offset by higher profit margins from secondary marketing activities. The increase in the gain on sales of loans, net when 2016 is compared to 2015 resulted from both higher profit margins from secondary marketing activities as well as higher volumes of loans sold. Loan sales decreased $205.4 million, or 14.8%, during 2017 to total $1.179 billion compared to an increase of $138.0 million, or 11.1%, during 2016 to total $1.384 billion. The decrease in loan sales during 2017 was principally due to the decline in mortgage lending activity due to increasing interest rates. The increase in loans sales during 2016 was due to increased mortgage lending activity and Trustmark's decision during 2015 to sell the vast majority of these lower-rate, longer-term home mortgages in the secondary market, rather than replacing the run-off in its single-family loan portfolio.\nOther Income, Net\nThe following table illustrates the components of other income, net included in noninterest income for the periods presented ($ in thousands):\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Partnership amortization for tax credit purposes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (9,560\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -3.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (9,916\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -1.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (10,050\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -15.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase in life insurance cash surrender value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -8.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other miscellaneous income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 89.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -43.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (484\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nn/m - percentage changes greater than +/- 100% are not considered meaningful\nThe increase in other income, net when 2017 is compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in other miscellaneous income as a result of $4.4 million of non-taxable bank-owned life insurance proceeds and the $4.9 million of non-routine, non-taxable proceeds related to life insurance acquired as part of a previous acquisition received during 2017. Excluding the non-taxable life insurance proceeds, other miscellaneous income for 2017 decreased $734 thousand, or 23.0%, when compared to 2016. The increase in other income, net when 2016 is compared to 2015, was primarily due to a decrease in the net reduction of the FDIC indemnification asset related to the acquired covered loans and covered other real estate, a net gain on the sale of premises and equipment as a result of the\nsale of a former bank branch during 2016 compared to a net loss on the sale of premises and equipment recorded during 2015 on the sale of a former bank branch acquired in the BancTrust merger and an increase in other miscellaneous income related to various vendor contract bonuses and settlements, an one-time arrangement fee and merchant service fees received during 2016.\nNoninterest Expense\nThe following table illustrates the comparative components of noninterest expense for the periods

expense are discussed in further detail below. Management considers disciplined expense management a key area of focus in the support of improving shareholder value.\nSalaries and Employee Benefits\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, Trustmark completed a voluntary ERP as a proactive measure to manage noninterest expense. As a result of the ERP, 188 of the eligible associates retired from Trustmark by June 30, 2016. The ERP resulted in non-routine expenses totaling $9.8 million ($9.6 million included in salaries and employee benefits expense and $213 thousand included in other expense) during 2016. As a result of the ERP, Trustmark realized cost savings in salaries and employee benefits expense of $4.4 million during 2016.\nAs previously announced, on July 26, 2016, the Board of Directors of Trustmark authorized the termination of the Plan, a noncontributory tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan, effective December 31, 2016. As a result of Trustmark's de-risking investment strategy for the Plan as of June 30, 2016, the expected rate of return on plan assets during the second half of 2016 decreased from 6.0% to 2.5%, which resulted in increased periodic benefit costs for the Plan. Included in salaries and employee benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2016, were non-routine pension expenses related to the de-risking investment strategy for the plan assets totaling $1.3 million.\nThe decrease in salaries and employee benefits, the largest component of noninterest expense, when 2017 is compared to 2016 was primarily due to the non-routine transaction expenses recorded in 2016. Excluding the non-routine transactions, salaries and employee benefits increased $6.3 million, or 2.7%, when 2017 is compared to 2016 primarily due to increase in salaries and incentive compensation as a result of general merit increase and the addition of the employees from Reliance. The increase in salaries and employee benefits, the largest category of noninterest expense, when 2016 is compared to 2015, was primarily due to non-routine transaction expenses related to the ERP and Plan termination and higher commissions expense as a result of improvements in mortgage loan production, partially offset by cost savings realized related to the ERP.\nServices and Fees\nThe increase in services and fees expense when 2017 is compared to 2016 was primarily to due to increases in data processing expenses related to software, partially offset by declines in other outside services and fees. The increase in services and fees expense when 2016 is compared to 2015, was primarily to due to increases in data processing expenses related to software, other outside services and fees and advertising, partially offset by declines in legal and communications expenses.\nOther Real Estate Expense\nThe increase in other real estate expense for 2017 compared to 2016 was principally due to a decline in the net gain on sales of other real estate partially offset by a decline in write-downs on other real estate. The decrease in other real estate expense for 2016 compared to 2015 was principally due to an increase in the net gain on sales of other real estate and a decrease in other real estate carrying costs. The net gain on sale of other real estate for 2017 totaled $2.1 million, compared to a net gain on the sale of other real estate of $7.0 million for 2016 and $4.0 million for 2015.

Excluding these non-routine transaction expenses, other expense for 2017 increased $788 thousand, or 1.7%, compared to 2016.\nThe decline in other expense when 2016 is compared to 2015 was primarily due to decreases in franchise taxes, the amortization of the non-taxable core deposit intangible asset and loan expenses, partially offset by increases in customer related fraud losses and a property valuation adjustment recorded during 2016 related to properties transferred to assets held for sale. During 2016, Trustmark continued its measured approach to the optimization of its retail delivery channels by consolidated nine branch offices across the Alabama, Florida and Mississippi market regions, and reallocated a portion of those resources into a new banking center in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and a new loan production office in Pensacola, Florida. Seven of the closed branches as well as two pieces of property previously purchased in anticipation of a future branch were transferred to assets held for sale during 2016 at the lower of the current book value or the fair value less costs to sell. A property valuation adjustment of $750 thousand was recorded as a result of transferring these properties to assets held for sale.\nResults of Segment Operations\nTrustmark's operations are managed along three operating segments: General Banking Division, Wealth Management Division and Insurance Division. A description of each segment and the methodologies used to measure financial performance and financial information by reportable segment are included in Note 20 - Segment Information located in Part II. Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.\nThe following table provides the net income by reportable segment for the periods presented ($ in thousands):\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General Banking\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 97,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 99,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 106,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Wealth Management\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,680\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated Net Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 105,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 108,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 116,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral Banking\nNet interest income for the General Banking Division for 2017 increased $19.8 million, or 5.1%, when compared with 2016. The increase in net interest income was principally due to an increase in interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI, which were partially offset by declines in interest and fees on acquired loans and interest on securities and an increase in total interest expense. Net interest income for the General Banking Division for 2016 decreased $4.5 million, or 1.1%, when compared with 2015. The decrease in net interest income was principally due to declines in interest and fees on acquired loans and interest on taxable securities and an increase in other interest expense, which were partially offset by an increase in interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI. The provision for loan losses, net during 2017 totaled $7.7 million compared with $14.7 million during 2016 and $11.8 million during 2015. For more information on these net interest income items, please see the sections captioned Financial Highlights\u201d and Results of Operations.\u201d\nNoninterest income for the General Banking Division increased $9.1 million, or 8.5%, during 2017 compared to an increase of $1.6 million, or 1.5%, during 2016. During 2017, Trustmark received $4.9 million in non-taxable proceeds related to life insurance acquired in a previous acquisition and $4.4 million of non-taxable proceeds related to bank-owned life insurance. Excluding these non-taxable proceeds, noninterest income for the General Banking Division was relatively unchanged when 2017 is compared to 2016. Noninterest income for the General Banking Division represented 22.2% of total revenue for 2017, 21.7% for 2016 and 21.2% for 2015. Noninterest income for the General Banking Division includes service charges on deposit accounts; bank card and other fees; mortgage banking, net; other, net and securities gains (losses), net. For more information on these noninterest income items, please see the analysis included in the section captioned Noninterest Income.\u201d\nNoninterest expense for the General Banking Division increased $18.7 million, or 5.3%, during 2017 compared to an increase of $6.3 million, or 1.8%, during 2016. The increase in noninterest expense for 2017 was principally due to non-routine transaction expenses related to the termination of the defined benefit pension plan and the Reliance merger. The increase in noninterest expense for 2016 was principally due to increases in salaries and employee benefits expense, primarily as a result of non-routine expenses related to the ERP, increased commission expense due to improved mortgage loan production and non-routine pension expense resulting from the de-risking strategy for plan assets in anticipation of the termination of the Plan, and services and fees, partially offset by declines in other real estate expense and other expense. For more information on these noninterest expense items, please see the analysis included in the section captioned Noninterest Expense.\u201d\nWealth Management\nDuring 2017, net income for the Wealth Management Division decreased $1.9 million, or 45.6%, compared to an increase of $274 thousand, or 7.1%, during 2016. Net interest income for the Wealth Management Division, which primarily consists of interest income earned on deposit accounts held by the Wealth Management Division, increased $184 thousand, or 25.3%, during 2017 compared to an increase of $389 thousand during 2016. Noninterest income, which includes income related to investment management, trust and brokerage services, increased $168 thousand, or 0.6%, during 2017, compared to a decrease of $1.1 million, or 3.6%, during 2016. The slight increase in noninterest income for the Wealth Management Division during 2017 was primarily attributable to an increase in commissions generated by the brokerage services unit, which was largely offset by declines in trust management fees as well as a decline in annuity income generated by the brokerage services unit. The decrease in noninterest income for the Wealth Management Division during 2016 was primarily attributable to declines in commissions and annuity income generated by the brokerage services unit and trust fees related to retirement planning and personal estate services, partially offset by growth in trust asset management fee income from mutual funds and custody services. Noninterest expense increased $3.4 million, or 14.1%, during 2017 compared to a decrease of $1.2 million, or 4.7%, during 2016. The increase in noninterest expense for the Wealth Management Division during 2017 was principally due to increases in outside services and fees, other miscellaneous expenses and allocated general overhead expense. The decrease in noninterest expense for the Wealth Management Division during 2016 was principally due to decreases in salaries and employee benefits, primarily due to lower commissions and salary expense partially offset by an increase in trust incentives expense, and data processing charges.\nAt December 31, 2017 and 2016, Trustmark held assets under management and administration of $10.640 billion and $10.255 billion and brokerage assets of $1.780 billion and $1.643 billion, respectively.\nInsurance\nNet income for the Insurance Division during 2017 increased $476 thousand, or 9.1%, compared to a decrease of $246 thousand, or 4.5%, during 2016. Noninterest income for the Insurance Division, which predominately consists of insurance commissions, increased $1.4 million, or 3.9%, during 2017, compared to an increase of $340 thousand, or 0.9%, during 2016. The increase in noninterest income for the Insurance Division during 2017 was primarily due to new business volume principally in property and casualty coverage as well as increases in other commission income. The slight increase in insurance commissions during 2016 was primarily due to new business commission volume primarily in group health coverage and an increase in contingent commissions from insurance companies, which was mostly offset by declines in business commission volume in property and casualty coverage and policy fees and other income. General business activity in Trustmark's geographic markets continues to improve marginally, resulting in increases in the demand for coverage on inventories, property, equipment, general liability and workers' compensation.\nNoninterest expense for the Insurance Division increased $809 thousand, or 2.8%, during 2017 and $532 thousand, or 1.9%, during 2016. The increase in noninterest expense for the Insurance Division during 2017 was primarily due to higher salaries and commissions expense resulting from modest general merit increases and improved performance as well as an increase in travel and entertainment expenses. The slight increase in noninterest expense for the Insurance Division during 2016 was principally due to increases in salaries and insurance expenses.\nDuring 2017, business conditions improved slightly in the markets served by FBBI. Trustmark performed an annual impairment test of the book value of goodwill held in the Insurance Division as of October 1, 2017, 2016, and 2015. Based on this analysis,\nTrustmark concluded that no impairment charge was required. A renewed period of falling prices and suppressed demand for the products of the Insurance Division may result in impairment of goodwill in the future. FBBI's ability to maintain the current income trend is dependent on the success of the subsidiary's continued initiatives to attract new business through cross referrals between practice units and bank relationships and seeking new business in other markets.\nIncome Taxes\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, Trustmark's combined effective tax rate was 31.6% compared to 22.3% in 2016 and 23.4% in 2015. During the fourth quarter of 2017, Trustmark incurred non-routine income tax expenses of $17.0 million related to the re-measurement of Trustmark's net deferred tax assets due to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act and the elimination of a deferred tax valuation allowance related to a prior merger. Excluding the effect of these non-routine income tax expenses, Trustmark's combined effective tax rate for 2017 was 20.6%. Trustmark invests in partnerships that provide income tax credits on a Federal and/or State basis (i.e., NMTC, low income housing tax credits and historical tax credits). The income tax credits related to these partnerships are utilized as specifically allowed by income tax law and are recorded as a reduction in income tax expense. The Tax Reform Act did not impact the availability or accounting for these income tax credits in general; however, as a result of the lower combined effective tax rate, Trustmark is limited in its ability to invest in any new tax credits. Trustmark estimates its combined effective tax rate will decrease to approximately 12.0% to 14.0% beginning in 2018, primarily as a result of the Tax Reform Act.\nFinancial Condition\nEarning assets serve as the primary revenue streams for Trustmark and are comprised of securities, loans, federal funds sold, securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements and other earning assets. Average earning assets totaled $12.274 billion, or 89.5% of total average assets, at December 31, 2017, compared with $11.485 billion, or 88.8% of total average assets, at December 31, 2016, an increase of $789.1 million, or 6.9%.\nSecurities\nThe securities portfolio is utilized by Management to manage interest rate risk, generate interest income, provide liquidity and use as collateral for public and wholesale funding. Risk and return can be adjusted by altering duration, composition and/or balance of the portfolio. The weighted-average life of the portfolio decreased to 3.8 years at December 31, 2017, compared to 4.1 years at December 31, 2016.\nWhen compared with December 31, 2016, total investment securities decreased by $220.2 million, or 6.3%, during 2017. This decrease resulted primarily from calls, maturities and pay-downs of the underlying loans of GSE guaranteed securities partially offset by purchases of GSE securities. Trustmark sold $27.7 million of securities during 2017, which generated a net gain of $15 thousand, compared to $25.0 million of securities sold during 2016, which generated a net loss of $310 thousand.\nDuring 2013, Trustmark reclassified approximately $1.099 billion of securities available for sale as securities held to maturity to mitigate the potential adverse impact of a rising interest rate environment on the fair value of the available for sale securities and the related impact on tangible common equity. The securities were transferred at fair value, which became the cost basis for the securities held to maturity. At the date of transfer, the net unrealized holding loss on the available for sale securities totaled approximately $46.6 million ($28.8 million net of tax). The net unrealized holding loss is amortized over the remaining life of the securities as a yield adjustment in a manner consistent with the amortization or accretion of the original purchase premium or discount on the associated security. There were no gains or losses recognized as a result of the transfer. At December 31, 2017, the net unamortized, unrealized loss on the transferred securities included in accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets totaled $19.5 million ($12.0 million net of tax) compared to $24.2 million ($14.9 million net of tax) at December 31, 2016.\nAvailable for sale securities are carried at their estimated fair value with unrealized gains or losses recognized, net of taxes, in AOCL, a separate component of shareholders' equity. At December 31, 2017, available for sale securities totaled $2.239 billion, which represented 67.9% of the securities portfolio, compared to $2.357 billion, or 67.0%, at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, unrealized losses, net on available for sale securities totaled $23.5 million compared to unrealized losses, net of $9.5 million at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, available for sale securities consisted of obligations of states and political subdivisions, GSE guaranteed mortgage-related securities and direct obligations of government agencies and GSEs.\nHeld to maturity securities are carried at amortized cost and represent those securities that Trustmark both intends and has the ability to hold to maturity. At December 31, 2017, held to maturity securities totaled $1.056 billion and represented 32.1% of the total securities portfolio, compared with $1.159 billion, or 33.0%, at December 31, 2016.\nThe

and collateralized mortgage obligations are included in maturity categories based on their stated maturity date. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations.\nManagement continues to focus on asset quality as one of the strategic goals of the securities portfolio, which is evidenced by the investment of approximately 96% of the portfolio in GSE-backed obligations and other Aaa-rated securities as determined by Moody's Investors Services (Moody's). None of the securities owned by Trustmark are collateralized by assets which are considered sub-prime. Furthermore, outside of stock ownership in the FHLB of Dallas, FHLB of Atlanta and Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Trustmark does not hold any other equity investment in a GSE.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Trustmark did not hold securities of any one issuer with a carrying value exceeding ten percent of total shareholders' equity, other than certain GSEs which are exempt from inclusion. Management continues to closely monitor the credit quality as well as the ratings of the debt and mortgage-backed securities issued by the GSEs and held in Trustmark's securities portfolio.\nThe following table presents Trustmark's securities portfolio by amortized cost and estimated fair value and by credit rating, as determined by Moody's, at December 31, 2017 ($ in thousands):\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amortized Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Estimated Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Securities Available for Sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Aaa\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,183,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 96.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,159,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 96.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Aa1 to Aa3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Baa1 to Baa3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Not Rated (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total securities available for sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,262,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,238,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Securities Held to Maturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Aaa\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,010,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 95.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 999,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 95.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Aa1 to Aa3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Baa1 to Baa3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Not Rated (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total securities held to maturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,056,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,046,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Not rated issues primarily consist of Mississippi municipal general obligations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table above presenting the credit rating of Trustmark's securities is formatted to show the securities according to the credit rating category, and not by category of the underlying security.

9.2%, compared to December 31, 2016. During the first quarter of 2017, Trustmark reclassified $36.7 million of acquired loans not accounted for under FASB ASC Topic 310-30 to LHFI due to the discount on these loans being fully amortized. Excluding the reclassified acquired loans, LHFI increased $682.0 million, or 8.7%, during 2017. The increase in LHFI, excluding the reclassified acquired loans, during 2017 represented net growth across all five of Trustmark's market regions and all loans categories. The discussion below excludes the reclassified acquired loans.\nDuring 2017, LHFI secured by real estate increased $513.8 million, or 10.6%, as growth in the Alabama, Texas, Mississippi and Florida market regions was partially offset by declines in the Tennessee market region. LHFI secured by construction, land development and other land increased $155.7 million, or 18.7%, during 2017, principally due to new loan growth in the other construction category, partially offset by other construction loans that were moved to the appropriate permanent categories upon completion of the related construction project. During 2017, $523.6 million in other construction loans were moved to the appropriate permanent categories upon completion, including $299.2 million in multi-family residential, $184.2 million in non-owner occupied and $40.7 million in owner occupied. Excluding all reclassifications between loan categories, growth in other construction loans across all five market regions totaled $690.0 million for 2017.\nLHFI secured by nonfarm, nonresidential properties (NFNR LHFI) increased $155.7 million, or 7.7%, during 2017, principally due to other construction loans that moved to permanent financing. Excluding other construction loan reclassifications, the NFNR LHFI portfolio declined $69.3 million, or 3.4%, during 2017. The decrease in the NFNR LHFI portfolio, excluding the other construction reclassifications, was primarily attributable to declines in non-owner occupied loans in Trustmark's Mississippi, Texas and Tennessee market regions as well as declines in owner occupied loans in the Mississippi and Florida market regions, partially offset by growth in non-owner occupied loans in the Florida and Alabama market regions and owner occupied loans in the Alabama, Tennessee and Texas market regions. Other real estate secured LHFI increased $198.2 million, or 62.3%, during 2017, primarily due to multi-family residential loans in Trustmark's Texas, Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee market regions that were moved from other construction loans to permanent financing. Excluding the other construction loan reclassifications, other real estate secured LHFI decreased $101.1 million, or 31.8%, during 2017.\nThe commercial and industrial loan portfolio increased $26.4 million, or 1.7%, during 2017, due to growth in the Alabama, Tennessee, Florida and Mississippi market regions, partially offset by declines in the Texas market region. Trustmark's exposure to the energy sector is primarily included in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio in Trustmark's Mississippi and Texas market regions. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, energy-related LHFI had outstanding balances of approximately $226.5 million and $271.5 million, respectively, which represented approximately 2.6% of Trustmark's total LHFI portfolio at December 31, 2017 compared to approximately 3.5% of the total LHFI portfolio at December 31, 2016. Trustmark has no loan exposure where the source of repayment, or the underlying security of such exposure, is tied to the realization of value from energy reserves. Should oil prices remain at current levels or below for a prolonged period of time, there is potential for downgrades to occur. Management will continue to monitor this exposure.\nState and other political subdivision LHFI increased $35.0 million, or 3.8%, during 2017 principally due to growth in the Mississippi and Alabama market regions, partially offset by declines in the Texas, Tennessee and Florida market regions. The other loan portfolio, which includes lending to nonprofits, financial intermediaries and real estate investment trusts, increased $105.6 million, or 27.0%, during 2017, which represented growth in all of Trustmark's market regions with the exception of the Florida market region.\nThe following table provides information regarding Trustmark's home equity loans and home equity lines of credit which are included in the LHFI secured by 1-4 family residential properties as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 ($ in thousands):\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Home equity loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 47,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 54,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Home equity lines of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 407,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 390,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of loans and lines for which Trustmark holds first lien\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of loans and lines for which Trustmark does not hold first lien\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDue to the increased risk associated with second liens, loan terms and underwriting guidelines differ from those used for products secured by first liens. Loan amounts and loan-to-value ratios are limited and are lower for second liens than first liens. Also, interest rates and maximum amortization periods are adjusted accordingly. In addition, regardless of lien position, the passing credit score for approval of all home equity lines of credit is higher than that of term loans. The allowance for loan losses, LHFI is also reflective of the increased risk related to second liens through application of a greater loss factor to this portion of the portfolio.\nIn the following tables, LHFI reported by region (along with related nonperforming assets and net charge-offs) are associated with location of origination except for loans secured by 1-4 family residential properties (representing traditional mortgages) and credit cards. These loans are included in the Mississippi market region because they are centrally analyzed and approved as part of a specific line of business located at Trustmark's headquarters in Jackson, Mississippi.\nThe following table presents the LHFI composition by region at December 31, 2017 and reflects a diversified mix of loans by region ($ in thousands):\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

estate lending and the practice of annual renewal of commercial lines of credit, approximately one-third of Trustmark's portfolio matures in less than one year. Such a short-term maturity profile is not unusual for a\ncommercial bank and provides Trustmark the opportunity to obtain updated financial information from its borrowers and to actively monitor its borrowers' creditworthiness.

Bulletin (SAB) No. 102, Selected Loan Loss Allowance Methodology and Documentation Issues,\u201d as well as other regulatory guidance. Trustmark's allowance has been developed using different factors to estimate losses based upon specific evaluation of identified individual LHFI considered impaired, estimated identified losses on various pools of LHFI and/or groups of risk rated LHFI with common risk characteristics and other external and internal factors of estimated probable losses based on other facts and circumstances. The level of Trustmark's allowance reflects Management's continuing evaluation of specific credit risks, loan loss experience, current loan portfolio growth, present economic, political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. For a complete description of Trustmark's allowance for loan loss methodology and the quantitative and qualitative factors included in the valuation allowance, please see Note 5 - LHFI and Allowance for Loan Losses, LHFI included in Part II.

million, or 7.7%, when compared with December 31, 2016. The increase in the allowance for loan loss during 2017 was principally due to an increase in quantitative reserves for commercial LHFI in Trustmark's Mississippi and Texas market regions as well as qualitative reserves in the Alabama market region, partially offset by a decline in the required specific reserve for impaired LHFI in the Mississippi market region. Total allowance coverage of nonperforming LHFI, excluding specifically reviewed impaired LHFI, increased to 320.84% at December 31, 2017, compared to 267.40% at December 31, 2016 due to a $7.2 million, or 10.5%, increase in the allowance for loan losses, LHFI excluding the specific reserves for impaired LHFI and a $2.0 million, or 7.9%, decrease in nonperforming LHFI excluding the specifically reviewed impaired LHFI during 2017. Allocation of Trustmark's $76.7 million allowance for loan losses, LHFI, represented 0.95% of commercial LHFI and 0.68% of consumer and home mortgage LHFI, resulting in an allowance to total LHFI of 0.90% as of December 31, 2017. This compares with an allowance to total LHFI of 0.91% at December 31, 2016, which was allocated to commercial LHFI at 0.97% and to consumer and mortgage LHFI at 0.68%.\nThe following tables present

net charge-off of $9.6 million, or 0.11% of average loans (LHFS and LHFI), compared to a net charge-off of $7.3 million, or 0.10% of average loans (LHFS and LHFI), in 2016, and a net charge-off of $10.4 million, or 0.15% of average loans (LHFS and LHFI), in 2015. The increase in net charge-offs during 2017 was principally due to an increase in charge-offs in the Mississippi market region primarily due to two large substandard credits that were charged-off during 2017. The decrease in total net charge-offs during 2016 was principally due to declines in charge-offs in the Mississippi, Florida, Tennessee and Alabama market regions partially offset by an increase in charge-offs in the Texas market region, primarily due to three large substandard credits that were charged off during 2016.\nThe provision for loan losses, LHFI represents the change in the estimated loan losses determined utilizing Trustmark's allowance for loan loss methodology net of charge-offs and recoveries of LHFI charged against net income. The provision for loan losses, LHFI, for 2017 totaled 0.18% of average loans (LHFS and LHFI), compared to 0.14% of average loans (LHFS and LHFI) in 2016 and 0.12% of average loans (LHFS and LHFI) in 2015. The increase in the provision for loan losses, LHFI for 2017 when compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in the amount of provision required related to existing and newly impaired LHFI, and the $1.1 million of additional reserves due to the potential loss exposure caused by Hurricane Harvey. The increase in the provision for loan losses, LHFI when 2016 is compared to 2015 primarily reflects the increase in the amount of required reserves for LHFI, partially offset by a decrease in net charge-offs and the additional provision expense recorded during 2015 as a result of revisions to the allowance for loan loss methodology.\nDuring 2015, Trustmark made revisions to both the quantitative and qualitative portions of the allowance for loan loss methodology for commercial and consumer LHFI. In total, these revisions resulted in an additional provision expense of $9.5 million during 2015. For a complete description of the revisions made to Trustmark's allowance for loan loss methodology during 2015, please see Note 5 - LHFI and Allowance for Loan Losses, LHFI included in Part II.

The decrease in other real estate, excluding covered other real estate, during 2017 was primarily due to properties sold in all five market of Trustmark's market regions as well as write-downs of properties in Trustmark's Mississippi, Florida and Alabama market regions partially offset by properties foreclosed in all five market regions.\nOn July 1, 2016, $388 thousand of covered other real estate was transferred to other real estate, excluding covered other real estate, as a result of the expiration of a loss-share agreement with the FDIC on June 30, 2016.

The remaining loss-share agreement with the FDIC, which covers loans secured by 1-4 family residential properties, will expire in 2021.

decrease of $4.8 million during 2015. The decrease in write-downs on other real estate, excluding covered other real estate, during 2017 was principally due to declines in other real estate write-downs in the Alabama and Tennessee\nmarket regions partially offset by an increase in write-downs of other real estate in the Mississippi and Florida market regions. The increase in write-downs on other real estate, excluding covered other real estate, during 2016 was primarily due to $2.2 million of reserves for other real estate write-downs used or released during 2015 in the Alabama, Tennessee and Mississippi market regions.\nThe following table illustrates other real estate, excluding covered other real estate, by type of property for each year in the five-year period ended December 31, 2017 ($ in thousands):\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Construction, land development and other land properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 27,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 47,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 61,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 65,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 1-4 family residential properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,696\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonfarm, nonresidential properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,696\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other real estate properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other real estate, excluding covered other\nreal estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 43,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 62,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 77,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 92,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 106,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor additional information regarding other real estate, including covered other real estate, see Note 10 - Other Real Estate included in Part II.

Trustmark's loss share agreement with the FDIC covering the acquired covered loans other than loans secured by 1-4 family residential properties expired on June 30, 2016. Trustmark's loss share agreement with the FDIC covering the acquired covered loans secured by 1-4 family residential properties will expire in 2021. Effective July 1, 2016, all acquired covered loans excluding the acquired covered loans secured by 1-4 family residential properties were reclassified to acquired noncovered loans. The revised presentation reflects total acquired loan information in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and tables below. All prior period information has been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\nThe table below provides the carrying value of the acquired loan portfolio by loan type for each year of the five-year period ended December 31, 2017 ($ in thousands):\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans secured by real estate:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Construction, land development and other land\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 42,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 59,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 101,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Secured by 1-4 family residential properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 61,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 97,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 130,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 174,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Secured by nonfarm, nonresidential properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 114,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 103,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 140,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 209,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 298,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other real estate secured\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial and industrial loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 88,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 149,889\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,772\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquired loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 261,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 272,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 390,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 549,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 804,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less allowance for loan losses, acquired loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net acquired loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 257,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 260,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 378,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 537,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 794,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2017, acquired loans declined $10.7 million, or 3.9%, compared to balances at December 31, 2016. During the first quarter of 2017, Trustmark reclassified $36.7 million of acquired loans not accounted for under FASB ASC Topic 310-30 to LHFI due to the discount on these loans being fully amortized. Additionally, acquired loans as of December 31, 2017 included $86.2 million of loans acquired in the Reliance merger completed on April 7, 2017. Excluding the reclassified acquired loans and the loans acquired in the Reliance merger, acquired loans decreased $60.2 million, or 22.1%, during 2017, primarily due to pay-downs and pay-offs of these acquired loans. Based on the most recent re-estimation of expected cash flows, Trustmark anticipates that acquired loan balances, excluding any settlement of debt, will decline approximately $15.0 million to $25.0 million during the first quarter of 2018. Trustmark also expects the yield on the acquired loans, excluding any recoveries, to be approximately 6.0% to 7.0% for the first quarter of 2018. As the balances in the acquired loan portfolio continue to run-off, Trustmark expects that the income benefit provided by this portfolio will also decline.\nLoans acquired in the Reliance merger were evaluated using a fair value process to determine the degree of credit deterioration since origination and the collectibility of contractually required payments. Approximately $7.9 million of the loans acquired in the Reliance\nmerger exhibited evidence of significant credit deterioration since origination and for which it was probable at acquisition that Trustmark would not be able to collect all contractually required payments. These loans are accounted for as acquired impaired loans under FASB ASC Topic 310-30.\nFor additional information regarding acquired loans, including changes in the net carrying value, see Note 6 - Acquired Loans included in Part II. Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.\nDeposits\nTrustmark's deposits are its primary source of funding and consist primarily of core deposits from the communities Trustmark serves. Deposits include interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing demand accounts, savings, money market, certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts. Total deposits were $10.578 billion at December 31, 2017 compared to $10.056 billion at December 31, 2016, an increase of $521.5 million, or 5.2%, primarily due to growth in interest-bearing deposits. During 2017, noninterest-bearing deposits increased $4.8 million, or 0.2%, primarily due to growth in public and consumer demand deposit accounts, while interest-bearing deposits increased $516.7 million, or 7.3%, primarily due to growth in all categories of interest-bearing deposits with the exception of public interest checking and money market accounts, reflecting the increase in interest rates in general and the Reliance merger. At December 31, 2017, the balance of deposits for branches associated with the Reliance merger was $163.6 million. Excluding these Reliance deposits, total deposits at December 31, 2017 increased $357.9 million, or 3.6%.\nShort-term Borrowings\nTrustmark uses short-term borrowings to fund growth of earning assets in excess of deposit growth. Short-term borrowings consist primarily of federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, short-term FHLB advances and GNMA optional repurchase loans. Short-term borrowings totaled $1.441 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $131.3 million, or 10.0%, when compared with $1.310 billion at December 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase in the outstanding balance of short-term FHLB advances as Trustmark continues to utilize this funding source to fund the difference between loan and deposit growth. Short-term FHLB advances increased $200.0 million during 2017 as a result of a $450.0 million increase in outstanding short-term advances with the FHLB of Dallas as well as the $250.0 million long-term FHLB advance with the FHLB of Dallas which was reclassified to short-term in May 2017 partially offset by the $500.0 million advance with the FHLB of Dallas that matured in December 2017.\nFederal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements totaled $469.8 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $539.8 million at December 31, 2016, a decrease of $70.0 million, or 13.0%. Of these amounts $139.8 million and $140.5 million, respectively, represented customer related transactions, such as commercial sweep repurchase balances. Excluding customer related transactions, federal funds purchased totaled $330.0 million at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $69.4 million when compared with $399.4 million at December 31, 2016.\nThe table below presents information concerning qualifying components of Trustmark's short-term borrowings for each of the last three years ($ in thousands):\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Federal funds purchased and securities sold under\nrepurchase agreements:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amount outstanding at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 469,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 539,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 441,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average interest rate at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.06\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.52\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.25\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Maximum amount outstanding at any month end during each period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 620,698\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 606,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 673,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average amount outstanding during each period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 512,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 495,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 503,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average interest rate during each period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.81\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.35\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.16\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Short-term borrowings:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amount outstanding at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 971,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 769,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 412,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average interest rate at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.35\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.72\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.58\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Maximum amount outstanding at any month end during each period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,423,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 769,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 858,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average amount outstanding during each period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,138,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 370,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 415,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average interest rate during each period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.14\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.69\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLong-term FHLB Advances\nLong-term FHLB advances totaled $946 thousand at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $250.1 million, or 99.6%, when compared with $251.0 million at December 31, 2016. During May of 2016, Trustmark obtained a $250.0 million variable rate long-term FHLB advance with a two-year maturity from the FHLB of Dallas. As noted above, during May 2017, the $250.0 million long-term FHLB\nadvance was reclassified from long-term to short-term. Trustmark chose to utilize FHLB advances with the FHLB of Dallas as a funding source for loan growth due to the advantageous rates available in comparison to other sources of funding. For additional information regarding Trustmark's long-term FHLB advances, please see the section captioned Liquidity.\u201d\nBenefit Plans\nDefined Benefit Plans\nAs disclosed in Note 14 - Defined Benefit and Other Postretirement Benefits included in Part II. Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report, Trustmark maintained a noncontributory tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan, the Plan, in which substantially all associates who began employment prior to 2007 participated. The Plan provided for retirement benefits based on the length of credited service and final average compensation, as defined in the Plan, which vested upon three years of service. Benefit accruals under the Plan were frozen in 2009, with the exception of benefit accruals for certain associates of acquired financial institutions covered through plans that were subsequently merged into the Plan. As previously reported, on July 26, 2016, the Board of Directors of Trustmark authorized the termination of the Plan, effective as of December 31, 2016.\nDuring the second quarter of 2017, Trustmark fully funded the Plan on a termination basis by contributing additional assets in the amount of $17.6 million in accordance with the IRS and Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation requirements. Participants in the plan elected to receive either a lump sum cash payment or annuity payments under a group annuity contract purchased from an insurance carrier. Final distributions were made to participants from plan assets and a one-time pension settlement expense was recognized totaling $17.6 million. After the distribution of plan assets during the second quarter of 2017, Trustmark estimates that the annual pension expense will be reduced by $3.0 million to $4.0 million.\nOther than the associates covered through these acquired plans that were merged into the Plan, associates have not earned additional benefits, except for interest as required by law, since the Plan was frozen. Current and former associates who participated in the Plan retained their right to receive benefits that accrued before the Plan was frozen.\nTo satisfy commitments made by Trustmark to associates covered through plans obtained in acquisitions and subsequently merged into the Plan (collectively, the Continuing Associates\u201d), on July 26, 2016, the Board of Directors of Trustmark also approved the spin-off of the portion of the Plan associated with the accrued benefits of the Continuing Associates into a new plan, the Continuing Plan, effective as of December 30, 2016, immediately prior to the termination of the Plan.\nAt December 31, 2017, the fair value of the Continuing Plan's assets totaled $4.6 million and was exceeded by the projected benefit obligation of $10.1 million by $5.5 million. Net periodic benefit cost equaled $20.5 million in 2017, compared with $7.5 million in 2016 and $4.9 million in 2015. The increase in the net periodic benefit cost during 2017 was principally due to the $17.6 million one-time pension settlement expense as a result of the termination of the Plan. Excluding this one-time pension settlement expense, net periodic benefit cost during 2017 totaled $2.8 million.\nThe fair value of plan assets is determined utilizing current market quotes, while the benefit obligation and periodic benefit costs are determined utilizing actuarial methodology with certain weighted-average assumptions. For 2017, 2016 and 2015, the process used to select the discount rate assumption under FASB ASC Topic 715 takes into account the benefit cash flow and the segmented yields on high-quality corporate bonds that would be available to provide for the payment of the benefit cash flow. Assumptions, which have been chosen to represent the estimate of a particular event as required by GAAP, have been reviewed and approved by Management based on recommendations from its actuaries. For additional information regarding the assumptions used by Management, please refer to the section captioned Critical Accounting Policies - Defined Benefit Plans.\u201d\nThe range of potential contributions to the Continuing Plan is determined annually by the Continuing Plan's actuary in accordance with applicable IRS rules and regulations. Trustmark's policy is to fund amounts that are sufficient to satisfy the annual minimum funding requirements and do not exceed the maximum that is deductible for federal income tax purposes. The actual amount of the contribution is determined annually based on the Continuing Plan's funded status and return on plan assets as of the measurement date, which is December 31. For the plan year ending December 31, 2017, Trustmark's minimum required contribution to the Continuing Plan was $113 thousand. During 2017, Trustmark contributed $200 thousand to the Continuing Plan for the plan year ended December 31 2017. For the plan year ending December 31, 2018, Trustmark's minimum required contribution to the Continuing Plan is expected to be $175 thousand; however, Management and the Board of Directors of Trustmark will monitor the Continuing Plan throughout 2018 to determine any additional funding requirements by the plan's measurement date.\nFor the plan year ending December 31, 2016, Trustmark's minimum required contribution to the Plan was zero. Since the Plan has terminated, there were no additional contributions required other than amounts necessary to facilitate the Plan termination.\nSupplemental Retirement Plans\nAs disclosed in Note 14 - Defined Benefit and Other Postretirement Benefits included in Part II. Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report, Trustmark maintains a nonqualified supplemental retirement plan covering key executive officers and senior officers as well as directors who have elected to defer fees. The plan provides for retirement and/or death benefits based on a participant's covered salary or deferred fees. Although plan benefits may be paid from Trustmark's general assets, Trustmark has purchased life insurance contracts on the participants covered under the plan, which may be used to fund future benefit payments under the plan. The measurement date for the plan is December 31. As a result of mergers prior to 2014, Trustmark became the administrator of small nonqualified supplemental retirement plans, for which the plan benefits were frozen prior to the merger date.\nAt December 31, 2017, the accrued benefit obligation for the supplemental retirement plans equaled $57.9 million, while the net periodic benefit cost equaled $3.4 million in 2017, $3.6 million in 2016 and $3.8 million in 2015. The net periodic benefit cost and projected benefit obligation are determined using actuarial assumptions as of the plans' measurement date, which is December 31. The process used to select the discount rate assumption under FASB ASC Topic 715 takes into account the benefit cash flow and the segmented yields on high-quality corporate bonds that would be available to provide for the payment of the benefit cash flow. At December 31, 2017, unrecognized actuarial losses and unrecognized prior service costs continue to be amortized over future service periods.\nLegal Environment\nInformation required in this section is set forth under the heading Legal Proceedings\u201d of Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies in Part II.

The following table provides a schedule of the amount of the payments due under those obligations as of December 31, 2017 ($ in thousands):\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> One to Three\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three to Five\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> After\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> One Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Five Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,356,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 342,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 57,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,758,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Securities sold under repurchase agreements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 118,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 118,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FHLB advances\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 900,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 900,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Junior subordinated debt securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 61,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 61,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 67,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,387,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 359,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 68,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 92,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,907,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital Resources\nAt December 31, 2017, Trustmark's total shareholders' equity was $1.572 billion, an increase of $51.5 million, or 3.4%, when compared to December 31, 2016. During 2017, shareholders' equity increased primarily as a result of net income of $105.6 million and the net change in pension and other postretirement benefit plans of $11.5 million, net of tax, partially offset by common stock dividends of $62.8 million. Trustmark utilizes a capital model in order to provide Management with a monthly tool for analyzing changes in its strategic capital ratios. This allows Management to hold sufficient capital to provide for growth opportunities and protect the balance sheet against sudden adverse market conditions, while maintaining an attractive return on equity to shareholders.\nRegulatory Capital\nTrustmark and TNB are subject to minimum risk-based capital and leverage capital requirements, as described in the section captioned Capital Adequacy\u201d included in Part I. Item 1. - Business of this report, which are administered by the federal bank regulatory agencies. These capital requirements, as defined by federal regulations, involve quantitative and qualitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet instruments. Trustmark's and TNB's minimum risk-based capital requirements include the phased in capital conservation buffer of 1.250% and 0.625% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. AOCL is not included in computing regulatory capital. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the financial statements of Trustmark and\nTNB and limit Trustmark's and TNB's ability to pay dividends. As of December 31, 2017, Trustmark and TNB exceeded all applicable minimum capital standards. In addition, Trustmark and TNB met applicable regulatory guidelines to be considered well-capitalized at December 31, 2017. To be categorized in this manner, Trustmark and TNB maintained minimum common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, total risk-based capital and Tier 1 leverage ratios, and were not subject to any written agreement, order or capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by their primary federal regulators to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measures. There are no significant conditions or events that have occurred since December 31, 2017, which Management believes have affected Trustmark's or TNB's present classification.\nIn 2006, Trustmark enhanced its capital structure with the issuance of trust preferred securities. For regulatory capital purposes, the trust preferred securities qualified as Tier 1 capital at December 31, 2017 and 2016. Trustmark intends to continue to utilize $60.0 million in trust preferred securities issued by the Trust as Tier 1 capital up to the regulatory limit, as permitted by the grandfather provision in the Dodd-Frank Act and the Basel III Final Rule.\nRefer to the section captioned Regulatory Capital\u201d included in Note 17 - Shareholders' Equity in Part II. Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report for an illustration of Trustmark's and TNB's actual regulatory capital amounts and ratios under regulatory capital standards in effect at December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nDividends on Common Stock\nDividends per common share for each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $0.92. Trustmark's dividend payout ratio for 2017, 2016 and 2015 was 58.97%, 57.50%, and 53.49%, respectively. Approval by TNB's regulators is required if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net income for that year combined with its retained net income of the preceding two years. TNB will have available in 2018 approximately $87.0 million plus its net income for that year to pay as dividends to Trustmark. The actual amount of any dividends declared in 2018 by Trustmark will be determined by Trustmark's Board of Directors.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity is the ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future financial obligations, including demand for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs and other corporate purposes. Consistent cash flows from operations and adequate capital provide internally generated liquidity. Furthermore, Management maintains funding capacity from a variety of external sources to meet daily funding needs, such as those required to meet deposit withdrawals, loan disbursements and security settlements. Liquidity strategy also includes the use of wholesale funding sources to provide for the seasonal fluctuations of deposit and loan demand and the cyclical fluctuations of the economy that impact the availability of funds. Management keeps excess funding capacity available to meet potential demands associated with adverse circumstances.\nThe asset side of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through maturities and cash flows from loans and securities as well as the ability to sell certain loans and securities while the liability portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through noninterest and interest-bearing deposits. Trustmark utilizes federal funds purchased, FHLB advances, securities sold under repurchase agreements as well as the Discount Window and, on a limited basis as discussed below, brokered deposits to provide additional liquidity. Access to these additional sources represents Trustmark's incremental borrowing capacity.\nDeposit accounts represent Trustmark's largest funding source. Average deposits totaled to $10.182 billion for 2017 and represented approximately 74.2% of average liabilities and shareholders' equity, compared to average deposits of $9.669 billion, which represented 74.7% of average liabilities and shareholders' equity for 2016.\nTrustmark utilizes a limited amount of brokered deposits to supplement other wholesale funding sources. At December 31, 2017, brokered sweep Money Market Deposit Account (MMDA) deposits totaled $38.6 million compared to $34.2 million at December 31, 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, Trustmark had $330.0 million in upstream federal funds purchased, compared to $399.4 million at December 31, 2016. Trustmark maintains adequate federal funds lines to provide sufficient short-term liquidity.\nTrustmark maintains a relationship with the FHLB of Dallas, which provided $900.0 million of outstanding short-term advances and no outstanding long-term advances at December 31, 2017 compared to $700.0 million of outstanding short-term advances and $250.0 million of outstanding long-term advances at December 31, 2016. The outstanding short-term FHLB advances at December 31, 2017 included the $250.0 million FHLB advance that was reclassified from long-term to short-term during May 2017. Under the existing borrowing agreement, Trustmark had sufficient qualifying collateral to increase FHLB advances with the FHLB of Dallas by $1.771 billion at December 31, 2017.\nIn addition, at December 31, 2017, Trustmark had $958 thousand in FHLB advances outstanding with the FHLB of Atlanta, which were acquired in the BancTrust merger, compared to $1.1 million at December 31, 2016. Trustmark has non-member status and thus no additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB of Atlanta.\nAdditionally, Trustmark has the ability to leverage its unencumbered investment securities as collateral. At December 31, 2017, Trustmark had approximately $1.299 billion available in unencumbered agency securities compared to $1.373 billion at December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to Management's decision to suspend reinvestment of security cash flows during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAnother borrowing source is the Discount Window. At December 31, 2017, Trustmark had approximately $1.042 billion available in collateral capacity at the Discount Window from pledges of commercial and industrial LHFI, compared with $998.1 million at December 31, 2016. This increase was due to the increase in the commercial and industrial LHFI portfolio during 2017.\nDuring 2006, Trustmark completed a private placement of $60.0 million of trust preferred securities through a newly formed Delaware trust affiliate, the Trust. The trust preferred securities mature September 30, 2036 and are redeemable at Trustmark's option. The proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred securities were used by the Trust to purchase $61.9 million in aggregate principal amount of Trustmark's junior subordinated debentures.\nThe Board of Directors of Trustmark currently has the authority to issue up to 20.0 million preferred shares with no par value. The ability to issue preferred shares in the future will provide Trustmark with additional financial and management flexibility for general corporate and acquisition purposes. At December 31, 2017, Trustmark had no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding.\nLiquidity position and strategy are reviewed regularly by Management and continuously adjusted in relationship to Trustmark's overall strategy. Management believes that Trustmark has sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet presently known cash flow requirements arising from ongoing business transactions.\nAsset/Liability Management\nOverview\nMarket risk reflects the potential risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and market prices. Trustmark has risk management policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk. Trustmark's primary market risk is interest rate risk created by core banking activities. Interest rate risk is the potential variability of the income generated by Trustmark's financial products or services, which results from changes in various market interest rates. Market rate changes may take the form of absolute shifts, variances in the relationships between different rates and changes in the shape or slope of the interest rate term structure.\nManagement continually develops and applies cost-effective strategies to manage these risks. Management's Asset/Liability Committee sets the day-to-day operating guidelines, approves strategies affecting net interest income and coordinates activities within policy limits established by the Board of Directors of Trustmark. A key objective of the asset/liability management program is to quantify, monitor and manage interest rate risk and to assist Management in maintaining stability in the net interest margin under varying interest rate environments.\nDerivatives\nTrustmark uses financial derivatives for management of interest rate risk. Management's Asset/Liability Committee, in its oversight role for the management of interest rate risk, approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging strategies. The most common derivatives employed by Trustmark are interest rate lock commitments, forward contracts (both futures contracts and options on futures contracts), interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and interest rate floors. As a general matter, the values of these instruments are designed to be inversely related to the values of the assets that they hedge (i.e., if the value of the hedged asset falls, the value of the related hedge rises). In addition, Trustmark has entered into derivatives contracts as counterparty to one or more customers in connection with loans extended to those customers. These transactions are designed to hedge interest rate, currency or other exposures of the customers and are not entered into by Trustmark for speculative purposes. Increased federal regulation of the derivatives markets may increase the cost to Trustmark to administer derivatives programs.\nOn April 4, 2013, Trustmark entered into a forward interest rate swap contract on junior subordinated debentures with a total notional amount of $60.0 million. The interest rate swap contract was designated as a derivative instrument in a cash flow hedge under FASB ASC Topic 815, with the objective of protecting the quarterly interest payments on Trustmark's $60.0 million of junior subordinated debentures issued to the Trust throughout the five-year period beginning December 31, 2014 and ending December 31, 2019 from the risk of variability of those payments resulting from changes in the three-month LIBOR interest rate. Under the swap, which became\neffective on December 31, 2014, Trustmark pays a fixed interest rate of 1.66% and receives a variable interest rate based on three-month LIBOR on a total notional amount of $60.0 million, with quarterly net settlements.\nNo ineffectiveness related to the interest rate swap designated as a cash flow hedge was recognized in the consolidated statements of income during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. The accumulated net after-tax gain related to the effective cash flow hedge included in AOCL totaled $278 thousand at December 31, 2017 compared to a net after-tax loss of $18 thousand at December 31, 2016. Amounts reported in AOCL related to this derivative are reclassified to other interest expense as interest payments are made on Trustmark's variable rate junior subordinated debentures. During the next twelve months, Trustmark estimates that $125 thousand will be reclassified as an increase to other interest expense.\nAs part of Trustmark's risk management strategy in the mortgage banking business, various derivative instruments such as interest rate lock commitments and forward sales contracts are utilized. Rate lock commitments are residential mortgage loan commitments with customers, which guarantee a specified interest rate for a specified period of time. Trustmark's obligations under forward contracts consist of commitments to deliver mortgage loans, originated and/or purchased, in the secondary market at a future date. The gross notional amount of Trustmark's off-balance sheet obligations under these derivative instruments totaled $265.0 million at December 31, 2017, with a positive valuation adjustment of $663 thousand, compared to $292.9 million, with a positive valuation adjustment of $3.8 million at December 31, 2016.\nTrustmark utilizes a portfolio of exchange-traded derivative instruments, such as Treasury note futures contracts and option contracts, to achieve a fair value return that economically hedges changes in fair value of the MSR attributable to interest rates. These transactions are considered freestanding derivatives that do not otherwise qualify for hedge accounting under GAAP. The total notional amount of these derivative instruments were $349.0 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $262.0 million at December 31, 2016. These exchange-traded derivative instruments are accounted for at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded in noninterest income in mortgage banking, net and are offset by the changes in the fair value of the MSR. The MSR fair value represents the present value of future cash flows, which among other things includes decay and the effect of changes in interest rates. Ineffectiveness of hedging the MSR fair value is measured by comparing the change in value of hedge instruments to the change in the fair value of the MSR asset attributable to changes in interest rates and other market driven changes in valuation inputs and assumptions. The impact of this strategy resulted in a net positive ineffectiveness of $254 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to a net negative ineffectiveness of $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and a net positive ineffectiveness of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively. The net positive ineffectiveness was primarily due to the mortgage spread widening during 2017 compared to 2016. The net negative ineffectiveness was primarily due to the tightening in the mortgage spread during 2016 compared to 2015.\nTrustmark offers certain interest rate derivatives products directly to qualified commercial lending clients seeking to manage their interest rate risk under loans they have entered into with TNB. Trustmark economically hedges interest rate swap transactions executed with commercial lending clients by entering into offsetting interest rate swap transactions with institutional derivatives market participants. Derivatives transactions executed as part of this program are not designated as qualifying hedging relationships under GAAP and are, therefore, carried on Trustmark's financial statements at fair value with the change in fair value recorded as noninterest income in bank card and other fees. Because these derivatives have mirror-image contractual terms, in addition to collateral provisions which mitigate the impact of non-performance risk, the changes in fair value are expected to substantially offset. As of December 31, 2017, Trustmark had interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $351.9 million related to this program, compared to $340.2 million as of December 31, 2016.\nTrustmark has agreements with its financial institution counterparties that contain provisions where if Trustmark defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then Trustmark could also be deemed to be in default on its derivatives obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the termination value of interest rate swaps in a liability position, which includes accrued interest but excludes any adjustment for nonperformance risk, related to these agreements was $80 thousand and $1.2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, Trustmark had posted collateral of $100 thousand against its obligations because of negotiated thresholds and minimum transfer amounts under these agreements. If Trustmark had breached any of these triggering provisions at December 31, 2017, it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at the termination value (which is expected to approximate fair market value).\nCredit risk participation agreements arise when Trustmark contracts with other financial institutions, as a guarantor or beneficiary, to share credit risk associated with certain interest rate swaps. These agreements provide for reimbursement of losses resulting from a third party default on the underlying swap. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, Trustmark had entered into two risk participation agreements as a beneficiary with an aggregate notional amount of $13.7 million and $14.2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, Trustmark had entered into six risk participation agreements as a guarantor with an aggregate notional amount of $37.1 million\ncompared to five risk participation agreements as a guarantor with an aggregate notional amount of $28.0 million at December 31, 2016. The aggregate fair values of these risk participation agreements were immaterial at December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nTrustmark's participation in the derivatives markets is subject to increased federal regulation of these markets. Trustmark believes that it may continue to use financial derivatives to manage interest rate risk and also to offer derivatives products to certain qualified commercial lending clients in compliance with the Volcker Rule. However, the increased federal regulation of the derivatives markets has increased the cost to Trustmark of administering its derivatives programs. Some of these costs (particularly compliance costs related to the Volcker Rule and other federal regulations) are expected to recur in the future.\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td>", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I am unable to respond to this prompt using a list of bullet points.

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following provides a narrative discussion and analysis of Trustmark's financial condition and results of operations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the supplemental financial data included in Part II. Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.\nExecutive Overview\nTrustmark continued to achieve solid financial results with total revenue of $148.0 million and $592.2 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively. Trustmark continued to maintain and expand customer relationships as reflected by growth across all five market regions in the LHFI portfolio, which increased $718.8 million, or 9.2%, during year ended December 31, 2017. During the first quarter of 2017, Trustmark reclassified $36.7 million of acquired loans not accounted for under FASB ASC Topic 310-30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality\u201d to LHFI due to the discount on these loans being fully amortized. Excluding the reclassified acquired loans, LHFI increased $682.0 million, or 8.7%, during 2017. Credit quality remained strong and continued to be an important contributor to Trustmark's financial success. Trustmark is committed to investments to support profitable revenue growth as well as reengineering and efficiency opportunities to enhance shareholder value. Trustmark's capital position remained solid, reflecting the consistent profitability of its diversified financial services businesses. Trustmark's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share. The dividend is payable March 15, 2018, to shareholders of record on March 1, 2018.\nDuring August 2017, the Texas Gulf Coast region was severely impacted by Hurricane Harvey. None of Trustmark's banking facilities in its Texas market region sustained damage, and all were able to reopen as soon as practical following the storm. In the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, Trustmark initiated a process to assess the storm's impact on its customers. Trustmark identified all loans where the collateral, project or mailing addresses were located within Federal Emergency Management Association (FEMA) designated disaster zip codes and proactively surveyed these customers to determine the extent of any damages. Potential loss exposure was calculated based upon customer responses as to the extent of damage suffered and applicable insurance coverage. As a result, Trustmark increased its allowance for loan losses for LHFI during the third quarter of 2017 by $1.1 million due to the potential loss exposure caused by Hurricane Harvey.\nOn April 7, 2017, Trustmark completed its previously announced merger with RB Bancorporation (Reliance). Reliance was the holding company for Reliance Bank, which had seven offices serving the Huntsville, Alabama metropolitan service area in northern Alabama. Reliance Bank was merged into TNB simultaneously with the merger of Trustmark and Reliance. Under the terms of the merger agreement dated November 14, 2016, Trustmark paid $22.00 in cash for each share of Reliance common stock outstanding, which represented payment to Reliance common shareholders of approximately $23.7 million. In addition, Trustmark paid off Reliance preferred stock of $1.1 million bringing the total consideration paid to $24.8 million. The operations of Reliance are included in Trustmark's operating results from April 7, 2017 and did not have a material impact on Trustmark's results of operations. During the second quarter of 2017, Trustmark included non-routine merger transaction expenses in other expense totaling $3.2 million.\nAs previously reported, on July 26, 2016, the Board of Directors of Trustmark authorized the termination of the Trustmark Capital Accumulation Plan (the Plan), a noncontributory tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan, effective as of December 31, 2016. The final distributions were made from current plan assets and a one-time pension settlement expense of $17.6 million was recognized when paid by Trustmark during the second quarter of 2017.\nFinancial Highlights\nTrustmark reported net income of $15.8 million, or basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.23, in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $28.9 million, or basic and diluted EPS of $0.43, in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in net income when the fourth quarter of 2017 is compared to the same time period in 2016 was principally due to an one-time charge to income taxes resulting from the re-measurement of Trustmark's net deferred tax assets due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Reform Act) and the elimination of a deferred tax valuation allowance related to a prior merger, which collectively reduced net income by $17.0 million, or $0.25 per diluted share. Excluding these non-routine transactions, net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $32.7 million, or diluted EPS of $0.48. The increase in net income, excluding the non-routine transactions, when the fourth quarter of 2017 is compared to the same time period in 2016 was principally due to an increase in total revenue (primarily due to increases in interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI, mortgage banking, net and other income, net principally as a result of proceeds received related to bank-owned life insurance) partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense. These factors are discussed in greater detail below. Trustmark's reported performance during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, produced a return on average tangible equity of 5.60%, a return on average assets of 0.45%, an average equity to average assets ratio of 11.40% and a dividend payout ratio of 100.00%, compared to a return on average tangible equity of 10.41%, a return on average assets of 0.87%, an average\nequity to average assets ratio of 11.63% and a dividend payout ratio of 53.49% during the quarter ended December 31, 2016. For a reconciliation between the reported net income and the net income adjusted for significant non-routine transactions as well as select financial ratios, please see the section captioned Significant Non-routine Transactions.\u201d\nRevenue, which is defined as net interest income plus noninterest income, totaled $148.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to $140.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $7.4 million, or 5.3%. The increase in total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was principally the result of increases in interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI, mortgage banking, net and other income, net, partially offset by an increase in total interest expense.\nInterest and fees on LHFS and LHFI increased $14.0 million, or 18.2%, when the fourth quarter of 2017 is compared to the same time period in 2016, primarily due to an increase in the LHFI portfolio and higher interest rates. LHFI totaled $8.570 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $718.8 million, or 9.2%, when compared to December 31, 2016, as a result of net growth across all of Trustmark's market regions and all categories in its LHFI portfolio. Mortgage banking, net for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $856 thousand, or 15.8%, when compared to the same time period in 2016, principally due to a decrease in the net negative mortgage valuation adjustment, partially offset by a decline in gain on sales of loans, net. Other income, net for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased $589 thousand, or 28.2%, when compared to the same time period in 2016 primarily due to non-taxable proceeds of $1.7 million related to bank-owned life insurance received during the fourth quarter of 2017. Interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $6.4 million, or 98.9%, when compared to the same time period in 2016 principally due to rising interest rates in general, which result in increases in interest on deposits and other interest expense. Interest expense on deposits for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased $3.9 million when compared to the same time period in 2016, principally due to rising interest rates in general, accompanied by increases in average balances of all categories of interest-bearing accounts. Other interest expense increased $1.9 million, or 71.1%, when the fourth quarter of 2017 is compared to the same time period in 2016, principally due to increases in rates in general and average balances of short-term FHLB advances partially offset by the decline in interest expense on the subordinated notes.\nTrustmark's provision for loan losses, LHFI for the three months ended December 31, 2017 totaled $5.7 million, an increase of $3.9 million when compared to a provision for loan losses, LHFI of $1.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in the provision for loan losses, LHFI for the fourth quarter of 2017 when compared to the same time period in 2016 was primarily due to an increase in the amount of provision required for existing and newly impaired LHFI, primarily in the Texas and Mississippi market regions, and an increase in the amount of provision related to quantitative reserve factors. Please see the section captioned Provision for Loan Losses, LHFI,\u201d for additional information regarding the provision for loan losses, LHFI. The provision for loan losses, acquired loans for the three months ended December 31, 2017 totaled a negative $1.6 million, a decrease of $2.7 million when compared to the same time period in 2016 principally due to changes in expectations based on the periodic re-estimations performed during the respective periods and a decline in acquired loan balances. Please see the section captioned Provision for Loan Losses, Acquired Loans,\u201d for additional information regarding the provision for loan losses, acquired loans. In total, the provision for loan losses, net was $4.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $1.2 million, or 39.6%, when compared to the same time period in 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, Trustmark reported net income of $105.6 million, or basic and diluted EPS of $1.56, compared to $108.4 million, or basic and diluted EPS of $1.60, for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $116.0 million, or basic and diluted EPS of $1.72 and $1.71, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in net income when 2017 is compared to 2016 was primarily due to increases in income taxes and noninterest expense (principally due to non-routine transaction expenses), which was partially offset by an increase in total revenue (primarily due to increases in interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI and other income, net principally as a result of proceeds received related to life insurance) and the decline in the provision for loan losses, acquired loans. These factors are discussed in greater detail below. During the fourth quarter of 2017, Trustmark incurred non-routine income tax expenses of $17.0 million related to the re-measurement of Trustmark's net deferred tax assets due to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act and the elimination of a deferred tax valuation allowance related to a prior merger. During the second quarter of 2017, Trustmark received $4.9 million in non-routine, nontaxable proceeds related to life insurance acquired in a previous acquisition. Additionally, Trustmark incurred non-routine transaction expenses of $17.6 million related to the termination of the defined benefit pension plan and $3.2 million related to the completion of the Reliance merger during the second quarter of 2017. Excluding these non-routine transactions, net income for 2017 totaled $130.6 million, or diluted EPS of $1.92. Trustmark's reported performance for the year ended December 31, 2017, produced a return on average tangible equity of 9.39%, a return on average assets of 0.77% and a dividend payout ratio of 58.97%, compared to a return on average tangible equity of 9.99%, a return on average assets of 0.84% and a dividend payout ratio of 57.50% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and a return on average tangible equity of 11.36%, a return on average assets of 0.95% and a dividend payout ratio of 53.49% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Trustmark's average equity to average assets ratio was 11.38%, 11.73% and 11.90% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For a reconciliation between the reported net income and the net income adjusted for significant non-routine transactions as well as select financial ratios, please see the section captioned Significant Non-routine Transactions.\u201d\nRevenue totaled $592.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $561.5 million and $564.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in total revenue for 2017 compared to 2016 was principally the result of increases in interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI and other income, net partially offset by an increase in total interest expense.\nInterest and fees on LHFS and LHFI for 2017 increased $45.0 million, or 15.0%, compared to 2016, primarily due to the year-over-year increase in the LHFI portfolio. Other income, net for 2017 increased $8.3 million when compared to 2016 primarily due to non-taxable proceeds of $4.4 million related to bank-owned life insurance received during 2017 and the $4.9 million in non-routine, non-taxable proceeds related to life insurance acquired in a previous acquisition received during the second quarter of 2017. Interest expense for 2017 increased $17.7 million, or 72.1%, when compared to 2016 due to rising interest rates in general. Interest expense on deposits for 2017 increased $10.0 million, or 78.2%, when compared to 2016, principally due to rising rates in general, accompanied by increases in average balances of all categories of interest-bearing deposits. Interest on federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements increased $2.4 million when 2017 is compared to 2016 principally due to increases in the target range for the federal funds rate by the FRB. Other interest expense increased $5.3 million, or 52.5%, when the year ended December 31, 2017 is compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, principally due to increases in rates in general, accompanied by increases in average balances of short-term FHLB advances partially offset by the decline in interest expense on the subordinated notes.\nTrustmark's provision for loan losses, LHFI, for 2017 totaled $15.1 million, an increase of $4.1 million, or 37.8%, when compared to a provision for loan losses, LHFI of $11.0 million for 2016. The increase in the provision for loan losses, LHFI for 2017 when compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in the amount of provision required related to existing and newly impaired LHFI, and the $1.1 million of additional reserves due to the potential loss exposure caused by Hurricane Harvey. Please see the section captioned Provision for Loan Losses, LHFI,\u201d for additional information regarding the provision for loan losses, LHFI. The provision for loan losses, acquired loans for 2017 totaled a negative $7.4 million, a decrease of $11.2 million when compared to 2016 principally due to changes in expectations based on the periodic re-estimations performed during the respective periods and a decline in acquired loan balances. Please see the section captioned Provision for Loan Losses, Acquired Loans,\u201d for additional information regarding the provision for loan losses, acquired loans. In total, the provision for loan losses, net was $7.7 million for 2017, a decrease of $7.0 million, or 47.7%, when compared to 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, nonperforming assets, excluding acquired loans, totaled $110.8 million, a decrease of $482 thousand, or 0.4%, compared to December 31, 2016 due to a decline in other real estate, which was largely offset by an increase in nonaccrual LHFI. Total nonaccrual LHFI were $67.6 million at December 31, 2017, representing an increase of $18.3 million, or 37.3%, relative to December 31, 2016 principally due to three large substandard credits moving to nonaccrual status during 2017. The percentage of loans, excluding acquired loans, that are 30 days or more past due and nonaccrual LHFI increased in 2017 to 1.53% compared to 1.33% in 2016 and 1.44% in 2015. Other real estate declined $18.8 million, or 30.3%, during 2017 primarily due to properties sold in all five market of Trustmark's market regions as well as write-downs of properties in Trustmark's Mississippi, Florida and Alabama market regions partially offset by properties foreclosed in all five market regions.\nLHFI totaled $8.570 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $718.8 million, or 9.2%, compared to December 31, 2016. During the first quarter of 2017, Trustmark reclassified $36.7 million of acquired loans not accounted for under FASB ASC Topic 310-30 to LHFI due to the discount on these loans being fully amortized. Excluding the reclassified acquired loans, LHFI increased $682.0 million, or 8.7%, during 2017. The increase in LHFI, excluding the reclassified acquired loans, during 2017 represented net growth across all five of Trustmark's market regions and all loan categories. For additional information regarding changes in LHFI and comparative balances by loan category, see the section captioned LHFI.\u201d\nBoth classified and criticized LHFI balances remain at low levels and continue to reflect strong credit quality. As of December 31, 2017, classified LHFI balances decreased $13.9 million, or 6.2%, while criticized LHFI balances decreased $602 thousand, or 0.2%, when compared to balances at December 31, 2016. All of the credits have been appropriately reserved.\nManagement has continued its practice of maintaining excess funding capacity to provide Trustmark with adequate liquidity for its ongoing operations. In this regard, Trustmark benefits from its strong deposit base, its highly liquid investment portfolio and its access to funding from a variety of external funding sources such as upstream federal funds lines, FHLB advances and, on a limited basis, brokered deposits.\nTotal deposits were $10.578 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $521.5 million, or 5.2% compared to December 31, 2016, primarily due to growth in interest-bearing deposits. During 2017, noninterest-bearing deposits increased $4.8 million, or 0.2%, primarily due to growth in consumer and public demand deposit accounts, which were largely offset by a decline in commercial demand deposit accounts, while interest-bearing deposits increased $516.7 million, or 7.3%, primarily due to growth in all categories of interest-bearing demand deposit accounts with the exception of public interest checking and money market accounts, reflecting the Reliance merger and increases in interest rates. At December 31, 2017, the balance of deposits for branches associated with the\nReliance merger was $163.6 million. Excluding these Reliance deposits, total deposits at December 31, 2017 increased $357.9 million, or 3.6%.\nTrustmark uses short-term borrowings to fund growth of earning assets in excess of deposits growth. Short-term borrowings totaled $1.441 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $131.3 million, or 10.0%, when compared to December 31, 2016 as a result of the increase in earning assets, principally LHFI, out-pacing the growth in deposits. The increase in short-term borrowings was primarily due to an increase in the outstanding balance of short-term FHLB advances as Trustmark continues to utilize this funding source to fund the difference between loan and deposit growth. Short-term FHLB advances increased $200.0 million during 2017 as a result of a $450.0 million increase in outstanding short-term advances with the FHLB of Dallas as well as the $250.0 million long-term FHLB advance with the FHLB of Dallas which was reclassified to short-term in May 2017 partially offset by the $500.0 million advance with the FHLB of Dallas that matured in December 2017.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nTrustmark's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and follow general practices within the financial services industry. Application of these accounting principles requires Management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, actual financial results could differ from those estimates.\nCertain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. These critical accounting policies are described below.\nFor additional information regarding the accounting policies discussed below, please see Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies set forth in Part II. Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.\nAllowance for Loan Losses, LHFI\nThe allowance for loan losses, LHFI is established through provisions for estimated loan losses charged against net income. The allowance reflects Management's best estimate of the probable loan losses related to specifically identified LHFI as well as probable incurred loan losses in the remaining loan portfolio and requires considerable judgment. The allowance is based upon Management's current judgments about the credit quality of the loan portfolio, including all internal and external factors that impact loan collectibility. Accordingly, the allowance is based upon both past events and current economic conditions.\nA significant shift in one or more factors included in the allowance for loan loss methodology could result in a material change to Trustmark's allowance for loan losses, LHFI. For example, if there were changes in one or more of the estimates, assumptions or judgments used as they relate to a portfolio of commercial LHFI, Trustmark could find that it needs to increase the level of future provisions for possible loan losses with respect to that portfolio. Additionally, credit deterioration of specific borrowers due to changes in these factors could cause the internally assigned risk rating to shift to a more severe category. As a result, Trustmark could find that it needs to increase the level of future provisions for possible loan losses with respect to these LHFI. Given the nature of many of these estimates, assumptions and judgments, it is not possible to provide meaningful estimates of the impact of any such potential shifts.\nFor a complete description of Trustmark's allowance for loan loss methodology, please see Note 5 - LHFI and Allowance for Loan Losses, LHFI included in Part II. Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.\nAcquired Loans\nAcquired loans are recorded at their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date. The fair value of acquired loans is determined using a discounted cash flow model based on assumptions regarding the amount and timing of principal and interest payments, estimated prepayments, estimated default rates, estimated loss severity in the event of defaults, and current market rates. Estimated credit losses are included in the determination of fair value; therefore, an allowance for loan losses is not recorded on the acquisition date.\nFor acquired impaired loans, Trustmark (i) calculates the contractual amount and timing of undiscounted principal and interest payments (the undiscounted contractual cash flows) and (ii) estimates the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal and interest payments (the undiscounted expected cash flows). Under FASB ASC Topic 310-30 the difference between the undiscounted contractual cash flows and the undiscounted expected cash flows is the nonaccretable difference. The nonaccretable difference represents an estimate of the loss exposure of principal and interest related to the acquired impaired loan portfolio, and such amount is\nsubject to change over time based on the performance of such loans. The excess of undiscounted expected cash flows at acquisition over the initial fair value of acquired impaired loans is referred to as the accretable yield\u201d and is recorded as interest income over the estimated life of the loans using the effective yield method if the timing and amount of the future cash flows is reasonably estimable. Under the effective yield method, the accretable yield is recorded as an accretion of interest income over the life of the loan.\nAs required by FASB ASC Topic 310-30, Trustmark periodically re-estimates the expected cash flows to be collected over the life of the acquired impaired loans. If, based on current information and events, it is probable that Trustmark will be unable to collect all cash flows expected at acquisition plus additional cash flows expected to be collected arising from changes in estimate after acquisition, the acquired loans are considered impaired. The decrease in the expected cash flows reduces the carrying value of the acquired impaired loans as well as the accretable yield and results in a charge-off through the allowance for loan losses, acquired loans or the establishment of an allowance for loan losses, acquired loans with a charge to income through the provision for loan losses, acquired loans. If, based on current information and events, it is probable that there is a significant increase in the cash flows previously expected to be collected or if actual cash flows are significantly greater than cash flows previously expected, Trustmark will reduce any remaining allowance for loan losses, acquired loans established on the acquired impaired loans for the increase in the present value of cash flows expected to be collected. The increase in the expected cash flows for the acquired impaired loans over those originally estimated at acquisition increases the carrying value of the acquired impaired loans as well as the accretable yield.\nMortgage Servicing Rights (MSR)\nTrustmark recognizes as assets the rights to service mortgage loans based on the estimated fair value of the MSR when loans are sold and the associated servicing rights are retained. Trustmark has elected to account for the MSR at fair value.\nThe fair value of the MSR is determined using a valuation model administered by a third party that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The model incorporates assumptions that market participants use in estimating future net servicing income, including estimates of prepayment speeds, discount rate, default rates, cost to service (including delinquency and foreclosure costs), escrow account earnings, contractual servicing fee income and other ancillary income such as late fees. Management reviews all significant assumptions quarterly. Mortgage loan prepayment speeds, a key assumption in the model, is the annual rate at which borrowers are forecasted to repay their mortgage loan principal. The discount rate used to determine the present value of estimated future net servicing income, another key assumption in the model, is an estimate of the required rate of return investors in the market would require for an asset with similar risk. Both assumptions can, and generally will, change as market conditions and interest rates change.\nBy way of example, an increase in either the prepayment speed or discount rate assumption will result in a decrease in the fair value of the MSR, while a decrease in either assumption will result in an increase in the fair value of the MSR. In recent years, there have been significant market-driven fluctuations in loan prepayment speeds and discount rates. These fluctuations can be rapid and may continue to be significant. Therefore, estimating prepayment speed and/or discount rates within ranges that market participants would use in determining the fair value of the MSR requires significant management judgment.\nAt December 31, 2017, the MSR fair value was approximately $84.3 million. The impact on the MSR fair value of either a 10% adverse change in prepayment speeds or a 100 basis point increase in discount rates at December 31, 2017, would be a decline in fair value of approximately $3.1 million. Changes of equal magnitude in the opposite direction would produce similar increases in fair value in the respective amounts.\nGoodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets\nTrustmark records all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions, including goodwill and other intangible assets, at fair value as required by FASB ASC Topic 805. The carrying amount of goodwill at December 31, 2017 totaled $334.6 million for the General Banking Division and $45.0 million for the Insurance Division, a consolidated total of $379.6 million. Trustmark's goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual tests for impairment or more often if events or circumstances indicate it may be impaired. Trustmark's identifiable intangible assets, which totaled $16.4 million at December 31, 2017, are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are subject to impairment tests if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount.\nThe initial recording and subsequent impairment testing of goodwill requires subjective judgments concerning estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets. The goodwill impairment test is performed in two phases. The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired; however, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an additional procedure must be performed. That additional procedure, or a second step, compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. An impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. Trustmark performed an annual impairment test of goodwill for reporting units contained in both the General Banking and Insurance Divisions as of October 1, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, which\nindicated that no impairment charge was required. The impairment test for the General Banking Division utilized valuations based on comparable deal values for financial institutions while the test for the Insurance Division utilizes varying valuation scenarios for the multiple of earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization method based on recent acquisition activity. Based on this analysis, Trustmark concluded that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value for both the General Banking Division and the Insurance Division; therefore, no impairment charge was required. Significant changes in future profitability and value of our reporting units could affect Trustmark's impairment evaluation.\nThe carrying amount of Trustmark's identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition. That assessment shall be based on the carrying amount of the intangible assets subject to amortization at the date it is tested for recoverability. Intangible assets subject to amortization shall be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nFair value may be determined using market prices, comparison to similar assets, market multiples and other determinants. Factors that may significantly affect the estimates include, among others, competitive forces, customer behavior and attrition, changes in revenue growth trends and specific industry or market sector conditions. Other key judgments in accounting for intangibles include determining the useful life of the particular asset and classifying assets as either goodwill (which does not require amortization) or identifiable intangible assets (which does require amortization).\nOther Real Estate\nOther real estate includes assets that have been acquired in satisfaction of debt through foreclosure and is carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less the estimated cost of disposition. Fair value is based on independent appraisals and other relevant factors. Valuation adjustments required at foreclosure are charged to the allowance for loan losses. Other real estate is revalued on an annual basis or more often if market conditions necessitate. An other real estate specific reserve may be recorded through other real estate expense for declines in fair value subsequent to foreclosure based on recent appraisals or changes in market conditions. Subsequent to foreclosure, losses on the periodic revaluation of the property are charged against a reserve specific to other real estate or to noninterest expense in other real estate expense if a reserve does not exist. Significant judgments and complex estimates are required in estimating the fair value of other real estate, and the period of time within which such estimates can be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of market volatility. As a result, the net proceeds realized from sales transactions could differ significantly from appraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates used to determine the fair value of other real estate.\nDefined Benefit Plans\nTrustmark's plan assets, projected benefit liabilities and cost are determined utilizing actuarially-determined present value calculations. The valuation of the projected benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost for the Trustmark Corporation Pension Plan for certain Employees of Acquired Financial Institutions (the Continuing Plan) and Trustmark's nonqualified supplemental retirement plans requires Management to make estimates regarding the amount and timing of expected cash outflows. Several variables affect these calculations, including (i) size and characteristics of the participant population, (ii) discount rate, (iii) expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and (iv) recognition of actual returns on plan assets. Below is a brief description of the variables that introduce material uncertainty into Management's estimates and the effect they have on estimated benefit cost.\n \u2022 Population and Characteristics of Participants. Benefit cost is directly related to the number of participants covered by the plan and characteristics such as salary, age, years of service and benefit terms. At December 31, 2017, the census for Trustmark's plans totaled 124 participants. \n \u2022 Discount Rate. The discount rate utilized in determining the present value of the future benefit obligation was 3.32% at December 31, 2017 (as compared to 3.71% at December 31, 2016). The discount rate for the plans is determined by matching the expected cash flows of the plans to a yield curve based on long term, high quality fixed income debt instruments available as of the measurement date (December 31, 2017). The discount rate is reset annually on the measurement date to reflect current economic conditions. If Trustmark assumes a 1.00% increase or decrease in the discount rate for Trustmark's plans and kept all other assumptions constant, the benefit cost associated with Trustmark's plans would decrease or increase by approximately $281 thousand and $314 thousand, respectively. \n \u2022 Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets. Based on historical experience and market projection of the target asset allocation set forth in the investment policy for the Continuing Plan, the pre-tax expected rate of return on the plan assets used in 2017 was 5.00%, versus 6.00% for the first half of the year and 2.50% thereafter in 2016 as a result of Trustmark's de-risking investment strategy. This expected rate of return is dependent upon the asset allocation decisions made with respect to plan assets. Annual differences, if any, between expected and actual return are included in the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss amount. Trustmark generally amortizes any cumulative unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in excess of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets. If \n Trustmark assumes a 1.00% increase or decrease in the expected long-term rate of return for the Continuing Plan, holding all other actuarial assumptions constant, the pension cost would decrease or increase by approximately $40 thousand. \n \u2022 Other Actuarial Assumptions. To estimate the projected benefit obligation, actuarial assumptions are required to be made by Management, including mortality rate, retirement rate, disability rate and the rate of compensation increases. \nContingent Liabilities\nTrustmark estimates contingent liabilities based on Management's evaluation of the probability of outcomes and their ability to estimate the range of exposure. As stated in FASB ASC Topic 450, Contingencies,\u201d a liability is contingent if the amount is not presently known but may become known in the future as a result of the occurrence of some uncertain future event. Accounting standards require that a liability be recorded if Management determines that it is probable that a loss has occurred, and the loss can be reasonably estimated. It is implicit in this standard that it must be probable that the loss will be confirmed by some future event. As part of the estimation process, Management is required to make assumptions about matters that are, by their nature, highly uncertain. The assessment of contingent liabilities, including legal contingencies and income tax liabilities, involves the use of critical estimates, assumptions and judgments. Management's estimates are based on their belief that future events will validate the current assumptions regarding the ultimate outcome of these exposures. However, there can be no assurance that future events, such as court decisions or Internal Revenue Service (IRS) positions, will not differ from Management's assessments. Whenever practicable, Management consults with outside experts (attorneys, consultants, claims administrators, etc.) to assist with the gathering and evaluation of information related to contingent liabilities.\nRecent Legislative and Regulatory Developments\nFor information regarding legislation and regulation applicable to Trustmark, see the section captioned Supervision and Regulation\u201d included in Part I. Item 1. - Business of this report.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to capital ratios defined by GAAP and banking regulators, Trustmark utilizes various tangible common equity measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy. Tangible common equity, as defined by Trustmark, represents common equity less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets.\nTrustmark believes these measures are important because they reflect the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation of these measures allows readers to compare certain aspects of Trustmark's capitalization to other organizations. These ratios differ from capital measures defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes shareholders' equity associated with preferred securities, the nature and extent of which varies across organizations. In Management's experience, many stock analysts use tangible common equity measures in conjunction with more traditional bank capital ratios to compare capital adequacy of banking organizations with significant amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets, typically stemming from the use of the purchase accounting method in accounting for mergers and acquisitions.\nThese calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by GAAP and banking regulators. Because GAAP does not include these capital ratio measures, Trustmark believes there are no comparable GAAP financial measures to these tangible common equity ratios. Despite the importance of these measures to Trustmark, there are no standardized definitions for them and, as a result, Trustmark's calculations may not be comparable with other organizations. Also, there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, Trustmark encourages readers to consider its audited consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nThe following table reconciles Trustmark's calculation of these measures to amounts reported under GAAP for the periods presented ($ in thousands, except per share data):\n\n (1) Calculated using net income adjusted for intangible amortization divided by total average tangible equity \n (2) Includes other intangible assets, net of DTLs, disallowed deferred tax assets, threshold deductions and transition adjustments, as applicable \nSignificant Non-routine Transactions\nTrustmark discloses certain non-GAAP financial measures, including net income adjusted for significant non-routine transactions, because Management uses these measures for business planning purposes, including to manage Trustmark's business against internal projected results of operations and to measure Trustmark's performance. Trustmark views net income adjusted for significant non-routine transactions as a measure of its core operating business, which excludes the impact of the items detailed below, as these items are generally not operational in nature. This non-GAAP measure also provides another basis for comparing period-to-period results as presented in the accompanying selected financial data table and the audited consolidated financial statements by excluding potential differences caused by non-operational and unusual or non-recurring items. Readers are cautioned that these adjustments are not permitted under GAAP. Trustmark encourages readers to consider its audited consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto, included in Part II. Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report, in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nThe following table presents adjustments to net income and select financial ratios as reported in accordance with GAAP resulting from significant non-routine items occurring during the periods presented ($ in thousands, except per share data):\n\nRe-measurement of Net Deferred Taxes\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, Trustmark re-measured its net deferred tax assets subsequent to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act which resulted in the reduction of the corporate federal income tax rate. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes,\u201d Trustmark recorded a one-time increase in deferred income tax expense of $25.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nElimination of Deferred Tax Valuation Allowance\nDuring 2013, a deferred tax valuation allowance was created as a result of Trustmark's merger with BancTrust Financial Group, Inc. (BancTrust) and was established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that was more likely than not to be realized in future years. Trustmark has continually evaluated this allowance since inception and, based on the weight of the available evidence, has determined that the deferred tax assets will not be subject to the limitations of Internal Revenue Code, Section 382 on the deductibility of built-in losses in future years. During the fourth quarter of 2017, Trustmark eliminated the valuation allowance and recorded a one-time decrease in deferred income tax expense of $8.7 million.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plan Termination Expense\nAs previously reported, on July 26, 2016, the Board of Directors of Trustmark authorized the termination of the Plan, a noncontributory tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan, effective as of December 31, 2016. The final distributions were made from current plan assets and a one-time pension settlement expense of $17.6 million, before taxes, which is included in noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nReliance Merger Transaction Expenses\nOn April 7, 2017, Trustmark completed its previously announced merger with Reliance. The operations of Reliance are included in Trustmark's operating results from April 7, 2017 and did not have a material impact on Trustmark's results of operations. During the second quarter of 2017, Trustmark included non-routine merger transaction expenses in other expense totaling $3.2 million, before tax.\nNon-taxable Gain on Acquired Life Insurance Proceeds\nDuring the second quarter of 2017, Trustmark received non-routine, non-taxable proceeds related to life insurance acquired in a previous acquisition. Included in other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2017 were non-routine, non-taxable proceeds of $4.9 million.\nEarly Retirement Program Expense\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, Trustmark completed a voluntary early retirement program (ERP) as a proactive measure to manage noninterest expense. Included in noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 were non-routine expenses related to the ERP totaling $9.8 million, before taxes, ($9.6 million included in salaries and employee benefits expense and $213 thousand included in other expense).\nPension Expense Due to De-risking Strategy in Plan Assets Portfolio\nOn July 26, 2016, the Board of Directors of Trustmark authorized the termination of the Plan effective December 31, 2016. As a result of Trustmark's de-risking investment strategy for the Plan as of June 30, 2016, the expected rate of return on plan assets during the second half of 2016 decreased from 6.0% to 2.5%, which resulted in increased periodic benefit costs for the Plan. Included in salaries and employee benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2016, were non-routine pension expenses related to the de-risking investment strategy for the plan assets totaling $1.3 million, before tax.\nResults of Operations\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is the principal component of Trustmark's income stream and represents the difference, or spread, between interest and fee income generated from earning assets and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds. Fluctuations in interest rates, as well as volume and mix changes in earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, can materially impact net interest income. The net interest margin is computed by dividing fully taxable equivalent (FTE) net interest income by average interest-earning assets and measures how effectively Trustmark utilizes its interest-earning assets in relationship to the interest cost of funding them. The accompanying Yield/Rate Analysis Table shows the average balances for all assets and liabilities of Trustmark and the interest income or expense associated with earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The yields and rates have been computed based upon interest income and expense adjusted to a FTE basis using a 35.0% federal marginal tax rate for all periods shown. Loans on nonaccrual have been included in the average loan balances, and interest collected prior to these loans having been placed on nonaccrual has been included in interest income. Loan fees included in interest associated with the average loan balances are immaterial.\nNet interest income-FTE for 2017 increased $21.5 million, or 5.3%, when compared with 2016. The net interest margin decreased 5 basis points to 3.48% for 2017 when compared to 2016. The decrease in the net interest margin was primarily the result of increases in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities in conjunction with rising rates in general, partially offset by an increase in the yield on LHFS and LHFI. The net interest margin excluding acquired loans, which equals the reported net interest income-FTE excluding interest and fees on acquired loans, as a percentage of average earning assets excluding average acquired loans, for 2017 was 3.36%, a decrease of 1 basis point when compared to 2016, due to the factors discussed above.\nAverage interest-earning assets for 2017 were $12.274 billion compared to $11.485 billion for 2016 an increase of $789.1 million, or 6.9%. The growth in average earning assets during 2017 was primarily due to an increase in average loans (LHFS and LHFI) of $820.5 million, or 10.8%, partially offset by a decrease in average acquired loans of $46.8 million, or 14.1%. The increase in average loans (LHFS and LHFI) was primarily attributable to the $718.8 million, or 9.2%, increase in the LHFI portfolio when balances at December 31, 2017 are compared to balances at December 31, 2016. This increase represented net growth across all of Trustmark's market regions and all categories in its LHFI portfolio. The decline in average acquired loans during 2017 was primarily attributable to anticipated pay-offs of acquired loans, principally related to the BancTrust merger, as well as the reclassification of $36.7 million of acquired loans not accounted for under FASB ASC Topic 310-30 to LHFI due to the discount on these loans being fully amortized, partially offset by the loans acquired in the Reliance merger.\nDuring 2017, interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI-FTE increased $46.8 million, or 14.8%, when compared to 2016, due to growth in LHFI, while the yield on loans (LHFS and LHFI) increased 15 basis points to 4.31% as a result of increases in interest rates. During 2017, interest and fees on acquired loans decreased $5.7 million, or 18.8%, compared to 2016, due to declines in recoveries on settlement of debt and accretion income, primarily related to loans acquired in the BancTrust merger, as acquired loans continue to pay-down as anticipated, partially offset by interest and fees on loans acquired in the Reliance merger. As a result, the yield on acquired loans decreased 50 basis points to 8.59% when 2017 is compared to 2016. During 2017, interest on securities decreased $2.5 million, or 3.0%, and the yield on securities declined 8 basis points to 2.31%, compared to 2016, principally due to calls, maturities\nand pay-downs of the underlying loans of higher yielding securities being replaced with lower yielding securities as well as a decline in the yield maintenance payments on prepaid mortgage-backed securities. As a result of these factors, interest income-FTE increased $39.2 million, or 9.1%, when 2017 is compared to 2016, while the yield on total earning assets increased 8 basis points to 3.83%.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities for 2017 totaled $8.963 billion compared to $8.281 billion for 2016, an increase of $682.1 million, or 8.2%. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities was principally due to increases in average short-term borrowings and interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a decline in average long-term FHLB advances. Average short-term borrowings for 2017 increased $768.3 million when compared to 2016, principally due to the increased balance in outstanding short-term FHLB advances with the FHLB of Dallas. Average interest-bearing deposits for 2017 increased $481.3 million, or 7.2%, when compared to 2016 principally due to growth in all categories of interest-bearing deposits as well as the deposits acquired in the Reliance merger. Average long-term FHLB advances decreased $536.7 million, or 84.6%, during 2017, primarily due to the $500.0 million long-term FHLB advance obtained from the FHLB of Dallas that was reclassified to short-term during December 2016 and the $250.0 million long-term FHLB advance obtained from the FHLB of Dallas during May 2016 that was reclassified to short-term in May 2017.\nTotal interest expense for 2017 increased $17.7 million, or 72.1%, when compared with 2016, principally due to rising interest rates in general. Interest expense on deposits for 2017 increased $10.0 million, or 78.2%, when compared to 2016, principally due to rising rates in general, accompanied by increases in average balances of all categories of interest-bearing deposits. The rate on interest-bearing deposits increased 13 basis points to 0.32% for 2017 compared to 0.19% for 2016. Interest on federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements increased $2.4 million while the rate increased 46 basis points to 0.81% when 2017 is compared to 2016 principally due to increases in the target range for the federal funds rate by the FRB. Other interest expense increased $5.3 million, or 52.5%, while the rate on other borrowings increased 27 basis points to 1.18% when the year ended December 31, 2017 is compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, principally due to increases in rates in general, accompanied by increases in average balances of short-term FHLB advances partially offset by the decline in interest expense on the subordinated notes which matured in December 2016. As a result of these factors, the overall rate on interest-bearing liabilities increased 17 basis points to 0.47% when 2017 is compared with 2016.\nNet interest income-FTE for 2016 decreased $2.3 million, or 0.6%, when compared with 2015. The net interest margin decreased 25 basis points to 3.53% for 2016 when compared to 2015. The decrease in the net interest margin reflected the prolonged low interest rate environment in the United States, and was primarily the result of decreases in the yield on acquired loans principally due to declines in accretion income and recoveries on settlement of debt related to acquired loans, downward repricing of LHFI in response to increased competitive pricing pressures and decreases in the yield on taxable securities. The net interest margin excluding acquired loans, which equals the reported net interest income-FTE excluding interest and fees on acquired loans, as a percentage of average earning assets excluding average acquired loans, for 2016 was 3.37%, a decrease of 9 basis points when compared to 2015, due to similar factors as discussed above.\nAverage interest-earning assets for 2016 were $11.485 billion compared to $10.791 billion for 2015 an increase of $693.4 million, or 6.4%. The growth in average earning assets during 2016 was primarily due to an increase in average loans (LHFS and LHFI) of $846.3 million, or 12.5%, partially offset by a decrease in average acquired loans of $130.9 million, or 28.3% and a decline in average total securities of $38.7 million, or 1.1%. The increase in average loans (LHFS and LHFI) was primarily attributable to the $759.8 million, or 10.7%, increase in the LHFI portfolio when balances at December 31, 2016 are compared to balances at December 31, 2015. This increase represented net growth across all of Trustmark's market regions and all categories in its LHFI portfolio, with the exception of other loans. The decline in average acquired loans during 2016 was primarily attributable to anticipated pay-offs of acquired loans, principally related to the BancTrust", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following provides a narrative discussion and analysis of Trustmark's financial condition and results of operations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the supplemental financial data included in Part II. Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.\nExecutive Overview\nTrustmark continued to achieve solid financial results with total revenue of $148.0 million and $592.2 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively. Trustmark continued to maintain and expand customer relationships as reflected by growth across all five market regions in the LHFI portfolio, which increased $718.8 million, or 9.2%, during year ended December 31, 2017. During the first quarter of 2017, Trustmark reclassified $36.7 million of acquired loans not accounted for under FASB ASC Topic 310-30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality\u201d to LHFI due to the discount on these loans being fully amortized. Excluding the reclassified acquired loans, LHFI increased $682.0 million, or 8.7%, during 2017. Credit quality remained strong and continued to be an important contributor to Trustmark's financial success. Trustmark is committed to investments to support profitable revenue growth as well as reengineering and efficiency opportunities to enhance shareholder value. Trustmark's capital position remained solid, reflecting the consistent profitability of its diversified financial services businesses. Trustmark's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share. The dividend is payable March 15, 2018, to shareholders of record on March 1, 2018.\nDuring August 2017, the Texas Gulf Coast region was severely impacted by Hurricane Harvey. None of Trustmark's banking facilities in its Texas market region sustained damage, and all were able to reopen as soon as practical following the storm. In the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, Trustmark initiated a process to assess the storm's impact on its customers. Trustmark identified all loans where the collateral, project or mailing addresses were located within Federal Emergency Management Association (FEMA) designated disaster zip codes and proactively surveyed these customers to determine the extent of any damages. Potential loss exposure was calculated based upon customer responses as to the extent of damage suffered and applicable insurance coverage. As a result, Trustmark increased its allowance for loan losses for LHFI during the third quarter of 2017 by $1.1 million due to the potential loss exposure caused by Hurricane Harvey.\nOn April 7, 2017, Trustmark completed its previously announced merger with RB Bancorporation (Reliance). Reliance was the holding company for Reliance Bank, which had seven offices serving the Huntsville, Alabama metropolitan service area in northern Alabama. Reliance Bank was merged into TNB simultaneously with the merger of Trustmark and Reliance. Under the terms of the merger agreement dated November 14, 2016, Trustmark paid $22.00 in cash for each share of Reliance common stock outstanding, which represented payment to Reliance common shareholders of approximately $23.7 million. In addition, Trustmark paid off Reliance preferred stock of $1.1 million bringing the total consideration paid to $24.8 million. The operations of Reliance are included in Trustmark's operating results from April 7, 2017 and did not have a material impact on Trustmark's results of operations. During the second quarter of 2017, Trustmark included non-routine merger transaction expenses in other expense totaling $3.2 million.\nAs previously reported, on July 26, 2016, the Board of Directors of Trustmark authorized the termination of the Trustmark Capital Accumulation Plan (the Plan), a noncontributory tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan, effective as of December 31, 2016. The final distributions were made from current plan assets and a one-time pension settlement expense of $17.6 million was recognized when paid by Trustmark during the second quarter of 2017.\nFinancial Highlights\nTrustmark reported net income of $15.8 million, or basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.23, in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $28.9 million, or basic and diluted EPS of $0.43, in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in net income when the fourth quarter of 2017 is compared to the same time period in 2016 was principally due to an one-time charge to income taxes resulting from the re-measurement of Trustmark's net deferred tax assets due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Reform Act) and the elimination of a deferred tax valuation allowance related to a prior merger, which collectively reduced net income by $17.0 million, or $0.25 per diluted share. Excluding these non-routine transactions, net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $32.7 million, or diluted EPS of $0.48. The increase in net income, excluding the non-routine transactions, when the fourth quarter of 2017 is compared to the same time period in 2016 was principally due to an increase in total revenue (primarily due to increases in interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI, mortgage banking, net and other income, net principally as a result of proceeds received related to bank-owned life insurance) partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense. These factors are discussed in greater detail below. Trustmark's reported performance during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, produced a return on average tangible equity of 5.60%, a return on average assets of 0.45%, an average equity to average assets ratio of 11.40% and a dividend payout ratio of 100.00%, compared to a return on average tangible equity of 10.41%, a return on average assets of 0.87%, an average\nequity to average assets ratio of 11.63% and a dividend payout ratio of 53.49% during the quarter ended December 31, 2016. For a reconciliation between the reported net income and the net income adjusted for significant non-routine transactions as well as select financial ratios, please see the section captioned Significant Non-routine Transactions.\u201d\nRevenue, which is defined as net interest income plus noninterest income, totaled $148.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to $140.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $7.4 million, or 5.3%. The increase in total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was principally the result of increases in interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI, mortgage banking, net and other income, net, partially offset by an increase in total interest expense.\nInterest and fees on LHFS and LHFI increased $14.0 million, or 18.2%, when the fourth quarter of 2017 is compared to the same time period in 2016, primarily due to an increase in the LHFI portfolio and higher interest rates. LHFI totaled $8.570 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $718.8 million, or 9.2%, when compared to December 31, 2016, as a result of net growth across all of Trustmark's market regions and all categories in its LHFI portfolio. Mortgage banking, net for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $856 thousand, or 15.8%, when compared to the same time period in 2016, principally due to a decrease in the net negative mortgage valuation adjustment, partially offset by a decline in gain on sales of loans, net. Other income, net for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased $589 thousand, or 28.2%, when compared to the same time period in 2016 primarily due to non-taxable proceeds of $1.7 million related to bank-owned life insurance received during the fourth quarter of 2017. Interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $6.4 million, or 98.9%, when compared to the same time period in 2016 principally due to rising interest rates in general, which result in increases in interest on deposits and other interest expense. Interest expense on deposits for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased $3.9 million when compared to the same time period in 2016, principally due to rising interest rates in general, accompanied by increases in average balances of all categories of interest-bearing accounts. Other interest expense increased $1.9 million, or 71.1%, when the fourth quarter of 2017 is compared to the same time period in 2016, principally due to increases in rates in general and average balances of short-term FHLB advances partially offset by the decline in interest expense on the subordinated notes.\nTrustmark's provision for loan losses, LHFI for the three months ended December 31, 2017 totaled $5.7 million, an increase of $3.9 million when compared to a provision for loan losses, LHFI of $1.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in the provision for loan losses, LHFI for the fourth quarter of 2017 when compared to the same time period in 2016 was primarily due to an increase in the amount of provision required for existing and newly impaired LHFI, primarily in the Texas and Mississippi market regions, and an increase in the amount of provision related to quantitative reserve factors. Please see the section captioned Provision for Loan Losses, LHFI,\u201d for additional information regarding the provision for loan losses, LHFI. The provision for loan losses, acquired loans for the three months ended December 31, 2017 totaled a negative $1.6 million, a decrease of $2.7 million when compared to the same time period in 2016 principally due to changes in expectations based on the periodic re-estimations performed during the respective periods and a decline in acquired loan balances. Please see the section captioned Provision for Loan Losses, Acquired Loans,\u201d for additional information regarding the provision for loan losses, acquired loans. In total, the provision for loan losses, net was $4.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $1.2 million, or 39.6%, when compared to the same time period in 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, Trustmark reported net income of $105.6 million, or basic and diluted EPS of $1.56, compared to $108.4 million, or basic and diluted EPS of $1.60, for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $116.0 million, or basic and diluted EPS of $1.72 and $1.71, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in net income when 2017 is compared to 2016 was primarily due to increases in income taxes and noninterest expense (principally due to non-routine transaction expenses), which was partially offset by an increase in total revenue (primarily due to increases in interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI and other income, net principally as a result of proceeds received related to life insurance) and the decline in the provision for loan losses, acquired loans. These factors are discussed in greater detail below. During the fourth quarter of 2017, Trustmark incurred non-routine income tax expenses of $17.0 million related to the re-measurement of Trustmark's net deferred tax assets due to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act and the elimination of a deferred tax valuation allowance related to a prior merger. During the second quarter of 2017, Trustmark received $4.9 million in non-routine, nontaxable proceeds related to life insurance acquired in a previous acquisition. Additionally, Trustmark incurred non-routine transaction expenses of $17.6 million related to the termination of the defined benefit pension plan and $3.2 million related to the completion of the Reliance merger during the second quarter of 2017. Excluding these non-routine transactions, net income for 2017 totaled $130.6 million, or diluted EPS of $1.92. Trustmark's reported performance for the year ended December 31, 2017, produced a return on average tangible equity of 9.39%, a return on average assets of 0.77% and a dividend payout ratio of 58.97%, compared to a return on average tangible equity of 9.99%, a return on average assets of 0.84% and a dividend payout ratio of 57.50% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and a return on average tangible equity of 11.36%, a return on average assets of 0.95% and a dividend payout ratio of 53.49% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Trustmark's average equity to average assets ratio was 11.38%, 11.73% and 11.90% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For a reconciliation between the reported net income and the net income adjusted for significant non-routine transactions as well as select financial ratios, please see the section captioned Significant Non-routine Transactions.\u201d\nRevenue totaled $592.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $561.5 million and $564.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in total revenue for 2017 compared to 2016 was principally the result of increases in interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI and other income, net partially offset by an increase in total interest expense.\nInterest and fees on LHFS and LHFI for 2017 increased $45.0 million, or 15.0%, compared to 2016, primarily due to the year-over-year increase in the LHFI portfolio. Other income, net for 2017 increased $8.3 million when compared to 2016 primarily due to non-taxable proceeds of $4.4 million related to bank-owned life insurance received during 2017 and the $4.9 million in non-routine, non-taxable proceeds related to life insurance acquired in a previous acquisition received during the second quarter of 2017. Interest expense for 2017 increased $17.7 million, or 72.1%, when compared to 2016 due to rising interest rates in general. Interest expense on deposits for 2017 increased $10.0 million, or 78.2%, when compared to 2016, principally due to rising rates in general, accompanied by increases in average balances of all categories of interest-bearing deposits. Interest on federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements increased $2.4 million when 2017 is compared to 2016 principally due to increases in the target range for the federal funds rate by the FRB. Other interest expense increased $5.3 million, or 52.5%, when the year ended December 31, 2017 is compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, principally due to increases in rates in general, accompanied by increases in average balances of short-term FHLB advances partially offset by the decline in interest expense on the subordinated notes.\nTrustmark's provision for loan losses, LHFI, for 2017 totaled $15.1 million, an increase of $4.1 million, or 37.8%, when compared to a provision for loan losses, LHFI of $11.0 million for 2016. The increase in the provision for loan losses, LHFI for 2017 when compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in the amount of provision required related to existing and newly impaired LHFI, and the $1.1 million of additional reserves due to the potential loss exposure caused by Hurricane Harvey. Please see the section captioned Provision for Loan Losses, LHFI,\u201d for additional information regarding the provision for loan losses, LHFI. The provision for loan losses, acquired loans for 2017 totaled a negative $7.4 million, a decrease of $11.2 million when compared to 2016 principally due to changes in expectations based on the periodic re-estimations performed during the respective periods and a decline in acquired loan balances. Please see the section captioned Provision for Loan Losses, Acquired Loans,\u201d for additional information regarding the provision for loan losses, acquired loans. In total, the provision for loan losses, net was $7.7 million for 2017, a decrease of $7.0 million, or 47.7%, when compared to 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, nonperforming assets, excluding acquired loans, totaled $110.8 million, a decrease of $482 thousand, or 0.4%, compared to December 31, 2016 due to a decline in other real estate, which was largely offset by an increase in nonaccrual LHFI. Total nonaccrual LHFI were $67.6 million at December 31, 2017, representing an increase of $18.3 million, or 37.3%, relative to December 31, 2016 principally due to three large substandard credits moving to nonaccrual status during 2017. The percentage of loans, excluding acquired loans, that are 30 days or more past due and nonaccrual LHFI increased in 2017 to 1.53% compared to 1.33% in 2016 and 1.44% in 2015. Other real estate declined $18.8 million, or 30.3%, during 2017 primarily due to properties sold in all five market of Trustmark's market regions as well as write-downs of properties in Trustmark's Mississippi, Florida and Alabama market regions partially offset by properties foreclosed in all five market regions.\nLHFI totaled $8.570 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $718.8 million, or 9.2%, compared to December 31, 2016. During the first quarter of 2017, Trustmark reclassified $36.7 million of acquired loans not accounted for under FASB ASC Topic 310-30 to LHFI due to the discount on these loans being fully amortized. Excluding the reclassified acquired loans, LHFI increased $682.0 million, or 8.7%, during 2017. The increase in LHFI, excluding the reclassified acquired loans, during 2017 represented net growth across all five of Trustmark's market regions and all loan categories. For additional information regarding changes in LHFI and comparative balances by loan category, see the section captioned LHFI.\u201d\nBoth classified and criticized LHFI balances remain at low levels and continue to reflect strong credit quality. As of December 31, 2017, classified LHFI balances decreased $13.9 million, or 6.2%, while criticized LHFI balances decreased $602 thousand, or 0.2%, when compared to balances at December 31, 2016. All of the credits have been appropriately reserved.\nManagement has continued its practice of maintaining excess funding capacity to provide Trustmark with adequate liquidity for its ongoing operations. In this regard, Trustmark benefits from its strong deposit base, its highly liquid investment portfolio and its access to funding from a variety of external funding sources such as upstream federal funds lines, FHLB advances and, on a limited basis, brokered deposits.\nTotal deposits were $10.578 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $521.5 million, or 5.2% compared to December 31, 2016, primarily due to growth in interest-bearing deposits. During 2017, noninterest-bearing deposits increased $4.8 million, or 0.2%, primarily due to growth in consumer and public demand deposit accounts, which were largely offset by a decline in commercial demand deposit accounts, while interest-bearing deposits increased $516.7 million, or 7.3%, primarily due to growth in all categories of interest-bearing demand deposit accounts with the exception of public interest checking and money market accounts, reflecting the Reliance merger and increases in interest rates. At December 31, 2017, the balance of deposits for branches associated with the\nReliance merger was $163.6 million. Excluding these Reliance deposits, total deposits at December 31, 2017 increased $357.9 million, or 3.6%.\nTrustmark uses short-term borrowings to fund growth of earning assets in excess of deposits growth. Short-term borrowings totaled $1.441 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $131.3 million, or 10.0%, when compared to December 31, 2016 as a result of the increase in earning assets, principally LHFI, out-pacing the growth in deposits. The increase in short-term borrowings was primarily due to an increase in the outstanding balance of short-term FHLB advances as Trustmark continues to utilize this funding source to fund the difference between loan and deposit growth. Short-term FHLB advances increased $200.0 million during 2017 as a result of a $450.0 million increase in outstanding short-term advances with the FHLB of Dallas as well as the $250.0 million long-term FHLB advance with the FHLB of Dallas which was reclassified to short-term in May 2017 partially offset by the $500.0 million advance with the FHLB of Dallas that matured in December 2017.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nTrustmark's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and follow general practices within the financial services industry. Application of these accounting principles requires Management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, actual financial results could differ from those estimates.\nCertain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. These critical accounting policies are described below.\nFor additional information regarding the accounting policies discussed below, please see Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies set forth in Part II. Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.\nAllowance for Loan Losses, LHFI\nThe allowance for loan losses, LHFI is established through provisions for estimated loan losses charged against net income. The allowance reflects Management's best estimate of the probable loan losses related to specifically identified LHFI as well as probable incurred loan losses in the remaining loan portfolio and requires considerable judgment. The allowance is based upon Management's current judgments about the credit quality of the loan portfolio, including all internal and external factors that impact loan collectibility. Accordingly, the allowance is based upon both past events and current economic conditions.\nA significant shift in one or more factors included in the allowance for loan loss methodology could result in a material change to Trustmark's allowance for loan losses, LHFI. For example, if there were changes in one or more of the estimates, assumptions or judgments used as they relate to a portfolio of commercial LHFI, Trustmark could find that it needs to increase the level of future provisions for possible loan losses with respect to that portfolio. Additionally, credit deterioration of specific borrowers due to changes in these factors could cause the internally assigned risk rating to shift to a more severe category. As a result, Trustmark could find that it needs to increase the level of future provisions for possible loan losses with respect to these LHFI. Given the nature of many of these estimates, assumptions and judgments, it is not possible to provide meaningful estimates of the impact of any such potential shifts.\nFor a complete description of Trustmark's allowance for loan loss methodology, please see Note 5 - LHFI and Allowance for Loan Losses, LHFI included in Part II. Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.\nAcquired Loans\nAcquired loans are recorded at their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date. The fair value of acquired loans is determined using a discounted cash flow model based on assumptions regarding the amount and timing of principal and interest payments, estimated prepayments, estimated default rates, estimated loss severity in the event of defaults, and current market rates. Estimated credit losses are included in the determination of fair value; therefore, an allowance for loan losses is not recorded on the acquisition date.\nFor acquired impaired loans, Trustmark (i) calculates the contractual amount and timing of undiscounted principal and interest payments (the undiscounted contractual cash flows) and (ii) estimates the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal and interest payments (the undiscounted expected cash flows). Under FASB ASC Topic 310-30 the difference between the undiscounted contractual cash flows and the undiscounted expected cash flows is the nonaccretable difference. The nonaccretable difference represents an estimate of the loss exposure of principal and interest related to the acquired impaired loan portfolio, and such amount is\nsubject to change over time based on the performance of such loans. The excess of undiscounted expected cash flows at acquisition over the initial fair value of acquired impaired loans is referred to as the accretable yield\u201d and is recorded as interest income over the estimated life of the loans using the effective yield method if the timing and amount of the future cash flows is reasonably estimable. Under the effective yield method, the accretable yield is recorded as an accretion of interest income over the life of the loan.\nAs required by FASB ASC Topic 310-30, Trustmark periodically re-estimates the expected cash flows to be collected over the life of the acquired impaired loans. If, based on current information and events, it is probable that Trustmark will be unable to collect all cash flows expected at acquisition plus additional cash flows expected to be collected arising from changes in estimate after acquisition, the acquired loans are considered impaired. The decrease in the expected cash flows reduces the carrying value of the acquired impaired loans as well as the accretable yield and results in a charge-off through the allowance for loan losses, acquired loans or the establishment of an allowance for loan losses, acquired loans with a charge to income through the provision for loan losses, acquired loans. If, based on current information and events, it is probable that there is a significant increase in the cash flows previously expected to be collected or if actual cash flows are significantly greater than cash flows previously expected, Trustmark will reduce any remaining allowance for loan losses, acquired loans established on the acquired impaired loans for the increase in the present value of cash flows expected to be collected. The increase in the expected cash flows for the acquired impaired loans over those originally estimated at acquisition increases the carrying value of the acquired impaired loans as well as the accretable yield.\nMortgage Servicing Rights (MSR)\nTrustmark recognizes as assets the rights to service mortgage loans based on the estimated fair value of the MSR when loans are sold and the associated servicing rights are retained. Trustmark has elected to account for the MSR at fair value.\nThe fair value of the MSR is determined using a valuation model administered by a third party that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The model incorporates assumptions that market participants use in estimating future net servicing income, including estimates of prepayment speeds, discount rate, default rates, cost to service (including delinquency and foreclosure costs), escrow account earnings, contractual servicing fee income and other ancillary income such as late fees. Management reviews all significant assumptions quarterly. Mortgage loan prepayment speeds, a key assumption in the model, is the annual rate at which borrowers are forecasted to repay their mortgage loan principal. The discount rate used to determine the present value of estimated future net servicing income, another key assumption in the model, is an estimate of the required rate of return investors in the market would require for an asset with similar risk. Both assumptions can, and generally will, change as market conditions and interest rates change.\nBy way of example, an increase in either the prepayment speed or discount rate assumption will result in a decrease in the fair value of the MSR, while a decrease in either assumption will result in an increase in the fair value of the MSR. In recent years, there have been significant market-driven fluctuations in loan prepayment speeds and discount rates. These fluctuations can be rapid and may continue to be significant. Therefore, estimating prepayment speed and/or discount rates within ranges that market participants would use in determining the fair value of the MSR requires significant management judgment.\nAt December 31, 2017, the MSR fair value was approximately $84.3 million. The impact on the MSR fair value of either a 10% adverse change in prepayment speeds or a 100 basis point increase in discount rates at December 31, 2017, would be a decline in fair value of approximately $3.1 million. Changes of equal magnitude in the opposite direction would produce similar increases in fair value in the respective amounts.\nGoodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets\nTrustmark records all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions, including goodwill and other intangible assets, at fair value as required by FASB ASC Topic 805. The carrying amount of goodwill at December 31, 2017 totaled $334.6 million for the General Banking Division and $45.0 million for the Insurance Division, a consolidated total of $379.6 million. Trustmark's goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual tests for impairment or more often if events or circumstances indicate it may be impaired. Trustmark's identifiable intangible assets, which totaled $16.4 million at December 31, 2017, are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are subject to impairment tests if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount.\nThe initial recording and subsequent impairment testing of goodwill requires subjective judgments concerning estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets. The goodwill impairment test is performed in two phases. The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired; however, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an additional procedure must be performed. That additional procedure, or a second step, compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. An impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. Trustmark performed an annual impairment test of goodwill for reporting units contained in both the General Banking and Insurance Divisions as of October 1, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, which\nindicated that no impairment charge was required. The impairment test for the General Banking Division utilized valuations based on comparable deal values for financial institutions while the test for the Insurance Division utilizes varying valuation scenarios for the multiple of earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization method based on recent acquisition activity. Based on this analysis, Trustmark concluded that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value for both the General Banking Division and the Insurance Division; therefore, no impairment charge was required. Significant changes in future profitability and value of our reporting units could affect Trustmark's impairment evaluation.\nThe carrying amount of Trustmark's identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition. That assessment shall be based on the carrying amount of the intangible assets subject to amortization at the date it is tested for recoverability. Intangible assets subject to amortization shall be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nFair value may be determined using market prices, comparison to similar assets, market multiples and other determinants. Factors that may significantly affect the estimates include, among others, competitive forces, customer behavior and attrition, changes in revenue growth trends and specific industry or market sector conditions. Other key judgments in accounting for intangibles include determining the useful life of the particular asset and classifying assets as either goodwill (which does not require amortization) or identifiable intangible assets (which does require amortization).\nOther Real Estate\nOther real estate includes assets that have been acquired in satisfaction of debt through foreclosure and is carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less the estimated cost of disposition. Fair value is based on independent appraisals and other relevant factors. Valuation adjustments required at foreclosure are charged to the allowance for loan losses. Other real estate is revalued on an annual basis or more often if market conditions necessitate. An other real estate specific reserve may be recorded through other real estate expense for declines in fair value subsequent to foreclosure based on recent appraisals or changes in market conditions. Subsequent to foreclosure, losses on the periodic revaluation of the property are charged against a reserve specific to other real estate or to noninterest expense in other real estate expense if a reserve does not exist. Significant judgments and complex estimates are required in estimating the fair value of other real estate, and the period of time within which such estimates can be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of market volatility. As a result, the net proceeds realized from sales transactions could differ significantly from appraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates used to determine the fair value of other real estate.\nDefined Benefit Plans\nTrustmark's plan assets, projected benefit liabilities and cost are determined utilizing actuarially-determined present value calculations. The valuation of the projected benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost for the Trustmark Corporation Pension Plan for certain Employees of Acquired Financial Institutions (the Continuing Plan) and Trustmark's nonqualified supplemental retirement plans requires Management to make estimates regarding the amount and timing of expected cash outflows. Several variables affect these calculations, including (i) size and characteristics of the participant population, (ii) discount rate, (iii) expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and (iv) recognition of actual returns on plan assets. Below is a brief description of the variables that introduce material uncertainty into Management's estimates and the effect they have on estimated benefit cost.\n \u2022 Population and Characteristics of Participants. Benefit cost is directly related to the number of participants covered by the plan and characteristics such as salary, age, years of service and benefit terms. At December 31, 2017, the census for Trustmark's plans totaled 124 participants. \n \u2022 Discount Rate. The discount rate utilized in determining the present value of the future benefit obligation was 3.32% at December 31, 2017 (as compared to 3.71% at December 31, 2016). The discount rate for the plans is determined by matching the expected cash flows of the plans to a yield curve based on long term, high quality fixed income debt instruments available as of the measurement date (December 31, 2017). The discount rate is reset annually on the measurement date to reflect current economic conditions. If Trustmark assumes a 1.00% increase or decrease in the discount rate for Trustmark's plans and kept all other assumptions constant, the benefit cost associated with Trustmark's plans would decrease or increase by approximately $281 thousand and $314 thousand, respectively. \n \u2022 Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets. Based on historical experience and market projection of the target asset allocation set forth in the investment policy for the Continuing Plan, the pre-tax expected rate of return on the plan assets used in 2017 was 5.00%, versus 6.00% for the first half of the year and 2.50% thereafter in 2016 as a result of Trustmark's de-risking investment strategy. This expected rate of return is dependent upon the asset allocation decisions made with respect to plan assets. Annual differences, if any, between expected and actual return are included in the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss amount. Trustmark generally amortizes any cumulative unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in excess of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets. If \n Trustmark assumes a 1.00% increase or decrease in the expected long-term rate of return for the Continuing Plan, holding all other actuarial assumptions constant, the pension cost would decrease or increase by approximately $40 thousand. \n \u2022 Other Actuarial Assumptions. To estimate the projected benefit obligation, actuarial assumptions are required to be made by Management, including mortality rate, retirement rate, disability rate and the rate of compensation increases. \nContingent Liabilities\nTrustmark estimates contingent liabilities based on Management's evaluation of the probability of outcomes and their ability to estimate the range of exposure. As stated in FASB ASC Topic 450, Contingencies,\u201d a liability is contingent if the amount is not presently known but may become known in the future as a result of the occurrence of some uncertain future event. Accounting standards require that a liability be recorded if Management determines that it is probable that a loss has occurred, and the loss can be reasonably estimated. It is implicit in this standard that it must be probable that the loss will be confirmed by some future event. As part of the estimation process, Management is required to make assumptions about matters that are, by their nature, highly uncertain. The assessment of contingent liabilities, including legal contingencies and income tax liabilities, involves the use of critical estimates, assumptions and judgments. Management's estimates are based on their belief that future events will validate the current assumptions regarding the ultimate outcome of these exposures. However, there can be no assurance that future events, such as court decisions or Internal Revenue Service (IRS) positions, will not differ from Management's assessments. Whenever practicable, Management consults with outside experts (attorneys, consultants, claims administrators, etc.) to assist with the gathering and evaluation of information related to contingent liabilities.\nRecent Legislative and Regulatory Developments\nFor information regarding legislation and regulation applicable to Trustmark, see the section captioned Supervision and Regulation\u201d included in Part I. Item 1. - Business of this report.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to capital ratios defined by GAAP and banking regulators, Trustmark utilizes various tangible common equity measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy. Tangible common equity, as defined by Trustmark, represents common equity less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets.\nTrustmark believes these measures are important because they reflect the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation of these measures allows readers to compare certain aspects of Trustmark's capitalization to other organizations. These ratios differ from capital measures defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes shareholders' equity associated with preferred securities, the nature and extent of which varies across organizations. In Management's experience, many stock analysts use tangible common equity measures in conjunction with more traditional bank capital ratios to compare capital adequacy of banking organizations with significant amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets, typically stemming from the use of the purchase accounting method in accounting for mergers and acquisitions.\nThese calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by GAAP and banking regulators. Because GAAP does not include these capital ratio measures, Trustmark believes there are no comparable GAAP financial measures to these tangible common equity ratios. Despite the importance of these measures to Trustmark, there are no standardized definitions for them and, as a result, Trustmark's calculations may not be comparable with other organizations. Also, there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, Trustmark encourages readers to consider its audited consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nThe following table reconciles Trustmark's calculation of these measures to amounts reported under GAAP for the periods presented ($ in thousands, except per share data):\nTable 59: <table>

transactions, because Management uses these measures for business planning purposes, including to manage Trustmark's business against internal projected results of operations and to measure Trustmark's performance. Trustmark views net income adjusted for significant non-routine transactions as a measure of its core operating business, which excludes the impact of the items detailed below, as these items are generally not operational in nature. This non-GAAP measure also provides another basis for comparing period-to-period results as presented in the accompanying selected financial data table and the audited consolidated financial statements by excluding potential differences caused by non-operational and unusual or non-recurring items. Readers are cautioned that these adjustments are not permitted under GAAP. Trustmark encourages readers to consider its audited consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto, included in Part II. Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report, in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nThe following table presents adjustments to net income and

</tr>\n</table>\nRe-measurement of Net Deferred Taxes\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, Trustmark re-measured its net deferred tax assets subsequent to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act which resulted in the reduction of the corporate federal income tax rate. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes,\u201d Trustmark recorded a one-time increase in deferred income tax expense of $25.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nElimination of Deferred Tax Valuation Allowance\nDuring 2013, a deferred tax valuation allowance was created as a result of Trustmark's merger with BancTrust Financial Group, Inc. (BancTrust) and was established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that was more likely than not to be realized in future years. Trustmark has continually evaluated this allowance since inception and, based on the weight of the available evidence, has determined that the deferred tax assets will not be subject to the limitations of Internal Revenue Code, Section 382 on the deductibility of built-in losses in future years. During the fourth quarter of 2017, Trustmark eliminated the valuation allowance and recorded a one-time decrease in deferred income tax expense of $8.7 million.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plan Termination Expense\nAs previously reported, on July 26, 2016, the Board of Directors of Trustmark authorized the termination of the Plan, a noncontributory tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan, effective as of December 31, 2016. The final distributions were made from current plan assets and a one-time pension settlement expense of $17.6 million, before taxes, which is included in noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nReliance Merger Transaction Expenses\nOn April 7, 2017, Trustmark completed its previously announced merger with Reliance. The operations of Reliance are included in Trustmark's operating results from April 7, 2017 and did not have a material impact on Trustmark's results of operations. During the second quarter of 2017, Trustmark included non-routine merger transaction expenses in other expense totaling $3.2 million, before tax.\nNon-taxable Gain on Acquired Life Insurance Proceeds\nDuring the second quarter of 2017, Trustmark received non-routine, non-taxable proceeds related to life insurance acquired in a previous acquisition. Included in other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2017 were non-routine, non-taxable proceeds of $4.9 million.\nEarly Retirement Program Expense\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, Trustmark completed a voluntary early retirement program (ERP) as a proactive measure to manage noninterest expense. Included in noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 were non-routine expenses related to the ERP totaling $9.8 million, before taxes, ($9.6 million included in salaries and employee benefits expense and $213 thousand included in other expense).\nPension Expense Due to De-risking Strategy in Plan Assets Portfolio\nOn July 26, 2016, the Board of Directors of Trustmark authorized the termination of the Plan effective December 31, 2016. As a result of Trustmark's de-risking investment strategy for the Plan as of June 30, 2016, the expected rate of return on plan assets during the second half of 2016 decreased from 6.0% to 2.5%, which resulted in increased periodic benefit costs for the Plan. Included in salaries and employee benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2016, were non-routine pension expenses related to the de-risking investment strategy for the plan assets totaling $1.3 million, before tax.\nResults of Operations\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is the principal component of Trustmark's income stream and represents the difference, or spread, between interest and fee income generated from earning assets and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds. Fluctuations in interest rates, as well as volume and mix changes in earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, can materially impact net interest income. The net interest margin is computed by dividing fully taxable equivalent (FTE) net interest income by average interest-earning assets and measures how effectively Trustmark utilizes its interest-earning assets in relationship to the interest cost of funding them. The accompanying Yield/Rate Analysis Table shows the average balances for all assets and liabilities of Trustmark and the interest income or expense associated with earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The yields and rates have been computed based upon interest income and expense adjusted to a FTE basis using a 35.0% federal marginal tax rate for all periods shown. Loans on nonaccrual have been included in the average loan balances, and interest collected prior to these loans having been placed on nonaccrual has been included in interest income. Loan fees included in interest associated with the average loan balances are immaterial.\nNet interest income-FTE for 2017 increased $21.5 million, or 5.3%, when compared with 2016. The net interest margin decreased 5 basis points to 3.48% for 2017 when compared to 2016. The decrease in the net interest margin was primarily the result of increases in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities in conjunction with rising rates in general, partially offset by an increase in the yield on LHFS and LHFI. The net interest margin excluding acquired loans, which equals the reported net interest income-FTE excluding interest and fees on acquired loans, as a percentage of average earning assets excluding average acquired loans, for 2017 was 3.36%, a decrease of 1 basis point when compared to 2016, due to the factors discussed above.\nAverage interest-earning assets for 2017 were $12.274 billion compared to $11.485 billion for 2016 an increase of $789.1 million, or 6.9%. The growth in average earning assets during 2017 was primarily due to an increase in average loans (LHFS and LHFI) of $820.5 million, or 10.8%, partially offset by a decrease in average acquired loans of $46.8 million, or 14.1%. The increase in average loans (LHFS and LHFI) was primarily attributable to the $718.8 million, or 9.2%, increase in the LHFI portfolio when balances at December 31, 2017 are compared to balances at December 31, 2016. This increase represented net growth across all of Trustmark's market regions and all categories in its LHFI portfolio. The decline in average acquired loans during 2017 was primarily attributable to anticipated pay-offs of acquired loans, principally related to the BancTrust merger, as well as the reclassification of $36.7 million of acquired loans not accounted for under FASB ASC Topic 310-30 to LHFI due to the discount on these loans being fully amortized, partially offset by the loans acquired in the Reliance merger.\nDuring 2017, interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI-FTE increased $46.8 million, or 14.8%, when compared to 2016, due to growth in LHFI, while the yield on loans (LHFS and LHFI) increased 15 basis points to 4.31% as a result of increases in interest rates. During 2017, interest and fees on acquired loans decreased $5.7 million, or 18.8%, compared to 2016, due to declines in recoveries on settlement of debt and accretion income, primarily related to loans acquired in the BancTrust merger, as acquired loans continue to pay-down as anticipated, partially offset by interest and fees on loans acquired in the Reliance merger. As a result, the yield on acquired loans decreased 50 basis points to 8.59% when 2017 is compared to 2016. During 2017, interest on securities decreased $2.5 million, or 3.0%, and the yield on securities declined 8 basis points to 2.31%, compared to 2016, principally due to calls, maturities\nand pay-downs of the underlying loans of higher yielding securities being replaced with lower yielding securities as well as a decline in the yield maintenance payments on prepaid mortgage-backed securities. As a result of these factors, interest income-FTE increased $39.2 million, or 9.1%, when 2017 is compared to 2016, while the yield on total earning assets increased 8 basis points to 3.83%.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities for 2017 totaled $8.963 billion compared to $8.281 billion for 2016, an increase of $682.1 million, or 8.2%. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities was principally due to increases in average short-term borrowings and interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a decline in average long-term FHLB advances. Average short-term borrowings for 2017 increased $768.3 million when compared to 2016, principally due to the increased balance in outstanding short-term FHLB advances with the FHLB of Dallas. Average interest-bearing deposits for 2017 increased $481.3 million, or 7.2%, when compared to 2016 principally due to growth in all categories of interest-bearing deposits as well as the deposits acquired in the Reliance merger. Average long-term FHLB advances decreased $536.7 million, or 84.6%, during 2017, primarily due to the $500.0 million long-term FHLB advance obtained from the FHLB of Dallas that was reclassified to short-term during December 2016 and the $250.0 million long-term FHLB advance obtained from the FHLB of Dallas during May 2016 that was reclassified to short-term in May 2017.\nTotal interest expense for 2017 increased $17.7 million, or 72.1%, when compared with 2016, principally due to rising interest rates in general. Interest expense on deposits for 2017 increased $10.0 million, or 78.2%, when compared to 2016, principally due to rising rates in general, accompanied by increases in average balances of all categories of interest-bearing deposits. The rate on interest-bearing deposits increased 13 basis points to 0.32% for 2017 compared to 0.19% for 2016. Interest on federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements increased $2.4 million while the rate increased 46 basis points to 0.81% when 2017 is compared to 2016 principally due to increases in the target range for the federal funds rate by the FRB. Other interest expense increased $5.3 million, or 52.5%, while the rate on other borrowings increased 27 basis points to 1.18% when the year ended December 31, 2017 is compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, principally due to increases in rates in general, accompanied by increases in average balances of short-term FHLB advances partially offset by the decline in interest expense on the subordinated notes which matured in December 2016. As a result of these factors, the overall rate on interest-bearing liabilities increased 17 basis points to 0.47% when 2017 is compared with 2016.\nNet interest income-FTE for 2016 decreased $2.3 million, or 0.6%, when compared with 2015. The net interest margin decreased 25 basis points to 3.53% for 2016 when compared to 2015. The decrease in the net interest margin reflected the prolonged low interest rate environment in the United States, and was primarily the result of decreases in the yield on acquired loans principally due to declines in accretion income and recoveries on settlement of debt related to acquired loans, downward repricing of LHFI in response to increased competitive pricing pressures and decreases in the yield on taxable securities. The net interest margin excluding acquired loans, which equals the reported net interest income-FTE excluding interest and fees on acquired loans, as a percentage of average earning assets excluding average acquired loans, for 2016 was 3.37%, a decrease of 9 basis points when compared to 2015, due to similar factors as discussed above.\nAverage interest-earning assets for 2016 were $11.485 billion compared to $10.791 billion for 2015 an increase of $693.4 million, or 6.4%. The growth in average earning assets during 2016 was primarily due to an increase in average loans (LHFS and LHFI) of $846.3 million, or 12.5%, partially offset by a decrease in average acquired loans of $130.9 million, or 28.3% and a decline in average total securities of $38.7 million, or 1.1%. The increase in average loans (LHFS and LHFI) was primarily attributable to the $759.8 million, or 10.7%, increase in the LHFI portfolio when balances at December 31, 2016 are compared to balances at December 31, 2015. This increase represented net growth across all of Trustmark's market regions and all categories in its LHFI portfolio, with the exception of other loans. The decline in average acquired loans during 2016 was primarily attributable to anticipated pay-offs of acquired loans, principally related to the BancTrust"}
