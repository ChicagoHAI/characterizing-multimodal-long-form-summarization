We offer gold, silver, platinum and palladium in the form of bars, plates, powder, wafers, grain, ingots and coins. Our Industrial unit services manufacturers and fabricators of products utilizing or incorporating precious metals. Our Coin and Bar unit deals in over 200 coin and bar products in a variety of weights, shapes and sizes for distribution to dealers and other qualified purchasers. We have trading centers in El Segundo, California and Vienna, Austria for buying and selling precious metals, which are open 24 hours each trading day, even when many major world commodity markets are closed. In addition to wholesale trading activity, A-Mark offers its customers a variety of services, including financing, storage, consignment, logistics and various customized financial programs. As a U.S. Mint-authorized purchaser of gold, silver and platinum coins, A-Mark purchases product directly from the U.S. Mint and other sovereign mints for sale to its customers.\nThrough our wholly-owned subsidiary Transcontinental Depository Services, referred to as TDS, we offer a variety of managed storage options for precious metals products to financial institutions, dealers, investors and collectors around the world. Our storage business generated less than 1% of total revenues for each of the periods presented.\nThe Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, A-M Global Logistics, LLC, referred to as Logistics, commenced operations as a logistics fulfillment center in July 2015. Logistics, based in Las Vegas, Nevada, provides our customers an array of complementary services, including receiving, handling, inventorying, processing, packing, and shipping of precious metals and custom coins on a secure basis. Our logistics business generated less than 1% of the total revenues for each of the periods presented.\nIn August 2016, the Company formed AMST, a joint venture with SilverTowne, L.P., referred to as SilverTowne, an Indiana-based producer of minted silver. As of June 30, 2018, the Company and SilverTowne, L.P. own 55% and 45%, respectively, of AMST. AMST acquired the entire minting operations (referred to as SilverTowne Mint) of SilverTowne, L.P., with the goal of providing greater product selection to our customers and greater pricing stability within the supply chain, as well as to gain increased access to silver during volatile market environments, which have historically resulted in higher demand for precious metals products.\nSecured Lending Segment\nThe Company operates its Secured Lending segment through its wholly-owned subsidiary, CFC. CFC has been in operation since 2005.\nCFC is a California licensed finance lender that originates and acquires commercial loans secured by bullion and numismatic coins. CFC's customers include coin and precious metal dealers, investors and collectors. As of June 30, 2018, CFC had approximately $110.4 million in secured loans outstanding, of which approximately 67.6% was originated by third parties and acquired by CFC and approximately 32.4% was originated by CFC.\nDirect Sales Segment\nThe Company operates its Direct Sales segment through its wholly-owned subsidiary Goldline Inc. ( Goldline\u201d). The Company acquired the business in August 2017 through an asset purchase transaction with Goldline LLC (see Note 1.) Goldline LLC had been in operation since 1960.\nGoldline is a direct retailer of precious metals to the investor community. Goldline markets its precious metal products primarily on radio, the internet and television, as well as through telephonic sales efforts, particularly to Goldline's repeat customers. The Company acquired the Goldline business with the objective of enhancing the Company's distribution capabilities by adding a direct-to-client distribution channel. The Company also anticipated that the acquisition would diversify the product and services offering to Goldline customers, through access to the Company's wider assortment of precious metal coins and bars, including CFC's secured lending services and TDS's storage and asset protection services. Since the acquisition, the Company has been focused on rationalizing the cost structure of the Goldline business to promote profitability.\nOur Strategy\nThe Company has grown from a small numismatics firm in 1965 to a significant participant in the bullion and coin markets, with approximately $7.6 billion and $7.0 billion in revenues for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our strategy continues to focus on growth, including the volume of our business, our geographic presence, particularly in Europe, and the scope of complementary products, services and technological tools that we offer to our customers. We intend to promote our growth by leveraging off the strengths of our existing integrated operations: the depth of our customer relations; our access to market makers, suppliers and government mints and other mints; our trading systems in the U.S. and Europe, are available 24 hours a day 7 days a week; our expansive precious metals dealer network; our depository relationships around the world; our knowledge of secured lending; our logistics capabilities; our trading expertise; and the quality and experience of our management team.\nOur Customers\nOur customers include financial institutions, bullion retailers, industrial manufacturers and fabricators, sovereign mints, refiners, coin and metal dealers, investors and collectors. The Company makes a two way market, which results in many customers also operating as our suppliers. This diverse base of customers purchases a variety of products from the Company in a multitude of grades, primarily in the form of coins and bars.\nFactors Affecting Revenues, Gross Profits, Interest Income and Interest Expense\nRevenues. The Company enters into transactions to sell and deliver gold, silver, platinum and palladium to industrial and commercial users, coin and bullion dealers, mints, and financial institutions. The metals are investment or industrial grade and are sold in a variety of shapes and sizes.\nThe Company also sells precious metals on forward contracts at a fixed price based on current prevailing precious metal spot prices with a certain delivery date in the future (up to six months from date of the forward contract.) Typically, these forward contracts are net settled against our other forward positions or are settled in cash, whereby no physical product is delivered. Sales on forward contracts can be a substantial portion of revenues in any given period. We enter into these forward contacts as part of our hedging strategy to mitigate our price risk of holding inventory; they are not entered into for speculative purposes.\nIn addition, the Company earns revenue by providing storage solutions for precious metals and numismatic coins for financial institutions, dealers, investors and collectors worldwide and by providing storage and order-fulfillment services to our retail customers. These revenue streams are complementary to our trading activity, and represent less than 1% of our revenues.\nThe Company operates in a high volume/low margin industry. Revenues are impacted by three primary factors: product volume, market prices and market volatility. A material change in any one or more of these factors may result in a significant change in the Company's revenues. A significant increase or decrease in revenues can occur simply based on changes in the underlying commodity prices and may not be reflective of an increase or decrease in the volume of products sold.\nGross Profits. Gross profit is the difference between our revenues and the cost of our products. Since we quote prices based on the current commodity market prices for precious metals, we enter into a combination of forward and futures contracts to effect a hedge position equal to the underlying precious metal commodity value, which substantially represents inventory subject to price risk. We enter into these derivative transactions solely for the purpose of hedging our inventory, and not for speculative purposes. Our gross profit includes the gains and losses resulting from these derivative instruments. However, the gains and losses on the derivative instruments are substantially offset by the gains and losses on the corresponding changes in the market value of our precious metals inventory. As a result, our results of operations generally are not materially impacted solely by changes in commodity prices.\nVolatility also affects our gross profits. Greater volatility typically causes the trading spreads to widen resulting in an increase in the gross profit. Product supply constraints during extended periods of higher volatility has historically resulted in a heightening of wider trading spreads resulting in further improvement in the gross profit.\nInterest Income. The Company enters into secured loans and secured financing structures with its customers under which it charges interest. Through its wholly owned subsidiary, CFC, the Company also enters into loans secured by precious metals and numismatic material owned by the borrowers and held by the Company for the term of the loan. The Company offers a number of secured financing options to its customers to finance their precious metals purchases including consignments and other structured inventory finance products whereby the Company earns a fee based on the underlying value of the precious metal.\nInterest Expense. The Company incurs interest expense as a result of usage under its lines of credit and related-party debt. The Company also incurs interest expense as a result of its product financing agreements for the transfer and subsequent re-acquisition of gold and silver at a fixed price with a third-party finance company, and may incur interest expense when we borrow precious metals from our suppliers under short-term arrangements, which can bear interest at a designated rate.\nPerformance Metrics\nIn addition to financial statement indicators, management also utilizes certain key operational metrics to assess the performance of our business.\nWe look at the number of ounces of gold and silver sold and delivered to our customers (excluding ounces recorded on forward contracts). These metrics reflect our business volume without regard to changes in commodity pricing, which also impacts revenue and can mask actual business trends.\nAnother measure of our business volume, unaffected by changes in commodity pricing, is Wholesale Trading & Ancillary Services segment ticket volume and Direct Sales segment ticket volume, which is the total number of orders processed by our trading desks in El Segundo, California and Vienna, Austria. In periods of higher volatility, there is generally increased trading in the commodity markets, and increased demand for our products, which translates into higher business volume. Generally, the ounces sold on a per-trading-ticket basis is substantially higher for orders placed telephonically compared to those placed on our online portal platform.\nInventory turnover is another performance measure on which we are focused. We define inventory turnover as the cost of sales during the relevant period divided by the average inventory during the period. Inventory turnover is a measure of how quickly inventory has moved during the period. A higher inventory turnover ratio, which we typically experience during periods of higher volatility when trading is more robust, reflects a more efficient use of our capital.\nFinally, as a measure of the size of our secured lending segment, we look at the number of outstanding secured loans to customers at the end of the fiscal quarter.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year end is June 30 each year. Unless otherwise stated, references to years in this report relate to fiscal years rather than to calendar years.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview of Results of Operations for the Years Ended June 30,

Overall gross profit decreased due to subdued market conditions (e.g., lower gold and silver sales volume, margins and trading profits ) compared to the prior fiscal year, offset by gross profit of the newly acquired Direct Sales segment (i.e., Goldline).\nThe Company's gross margin percentage decreased by 13.6% to 0.387% from 0.448% in 2017. The drop in gross margin percentage was largely attributable to lower margins resulting from subdued market conditions, higher forward sales, which increase revenues but are associated with negligible gross margin percentages (i.e., near zero) that lowers the overall percentage and lower trading profits, offset by gross margin of the newly acquired Direct Sales segment (i.e., Goldline). The Company enters into forward contracts to hedge its precious metals price risk exposure and not for speculative purposes.\nOur inventory turnover rate for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased by 1.9%, to 26.8 from 26.3 in 2017. The inventory turnover rate for fiscal 2018 was fairly consistent with fiscal 2017.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>in thousands\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase/(decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase/(decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(33,398\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.439\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(23,343\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.334\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased $10.1 million, or 43.1%, to $33.4 million from $23.3 million in 2017.

Interest income from our Secured Lending segment increased by $1.9 million or by 24.5% in comparison to the same year-ago period, which represents approximately 53.3% of the aggregate increase. This increase in interest from secured loans was primarily due to increases in interest rates and an increase in the aggregate value of the secured loan portfolio. The number of secured loans outstanding increased by 47.7% to 3,507 from 2,375 in 2017.\nThe aggregate increase in interest income also increased due to other finance product income.

The increase was related primarily to a greater usage of our Trading Credit Facility, our new related-party debt financing agreement associated with our acquisition of Goldline, higher LIBOR interest rates that went in to effect subsequent to the Federal Reserve rate increases, and increased third-party loan servicing fees. As compared to the same year-ago period, the following interest expense components increased by (i) $1.8 million or 24.8% related to the Trading Credit Facility (including debt amortization costs), (ii) $0.6 million related to the Goldline Credit Facility, (iii) $0.4 million, or 27.7% related to third-party loan processing fees for acquired secured loans, (iv) $0.3 million related to our liability on borrowed metal balances, and (v) $0.6 million or 40.8% related to product financing agreements with our customers.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>in thousands\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase/(decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase/(decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,721\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.053\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,713\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(99.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur provision for income taxes was $0.0 million and $3.7 million for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our effective tax rate was approximately 0.2% and 34.5% for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our effective tax rate for the year ended June 30, 2018 differs from the federal statutory rate of 28.06% primarily due to the tax impact of a one-time revaluation of net deferred tax assets to reflect their value at the reduced corporate tax rate under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\"). Our effective tax rate for the year ended June 30, 2017 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to favorable tax attributes and deductions resulting from amended state tax filings based on the settlement of the Former parent's tax examination in the years when the Company was included in a consolidated filing. These favorable attributes are allocated to the standalone Company. The change in effective tax rate was also partially due to non-deductible transaction costs in the prior year that become deductible in the current year when the transaction was abandoned.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act\nOn December 22, 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which significantly changed the existing US tax laws, including a reduction in the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result of the enactment of the legislation, the Company incurred a provisional one-time tax expense of $1.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2018, primarily related to the re-measurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company incurred a tax benefit from operations (both recurring and non-recurring) which is largely offset by a one-time revaluation adjustment under TCJA of $1.2 million for year ended June 30, 2018.\nSegment Results of Operations\nThe Company conducts its operations in three reportable segments: (1) Wholesale Trading & Ancillary Services, (2) Secured Lending and (3) Direct Sales.

Overall gross profit decreased due to subdued market conditions (e.g., lower gold and silver sales volume, margins and trading profits) compared to the prior fiscal year.\nThe Company's profit margin percentage decreased by 28.6% to 0.320% from 0.448% in 2017 and was largely attributable lower margins resulting from subdued market conditions and higher forward contracts, which increase revenues but have negligible impact on the gross margin (i.e., near zero) that lowers the overall percentage and lower trading profits. The Company enters into forward contracts to hedge its precious metals price risk exposure and not for speculative purposes. Excluding the effects of forwards sales and trading profits on the gross margin, gross margin percentage related to physical trades decreased by 4.3%.\nThe wholesale trading ticket volume for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased by 2,028 tickets, or 1.8%, to 114,935 tickets from 112,907 tickets in 2017. The increase in our trading ticket volume was primarily the result of an increase in customer usage of our online portal. Generally, the quantity-size (i.e., ounces) of customer orders placed through the portal is less than the quantity size of orders processed through our trading desk.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses - Wholesale Trading & Ancillary Services\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>in thousands\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase/(decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase/(decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(21,096\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.280\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(21,529\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.308\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(433\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2018 decreased $0.4 million, or 2.0%, to $21.1 million from $21.5 million in 2017.The decrease was primarily due to lower selling, general and administrative expense related to a $1.0 million reduction to incentive compensation expense, partially offset by $0.4 million non-recurring legal expense.\nInterest Income - Wholesale Trading & Ancillary Services\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>in thousands\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase/(decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase/(decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.086\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.069\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest income for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased $1.7 million, or 34.5%, to $6.5 million from $4.8 million in 2017.

The Company is also optimizing selling, general and administration expenses to align with current market conditions and promote profitability.\nLIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION\nPrimary Sources and Uses of Cash\nOverview\nLiquidity is defined as our ability to generate sufficient amounts of cash to meet all of our cash needs. Liquidity is of critical importance to us and imperative to maintain our operations on a daily basis.\nA substantial portion of our assets are liquid. As of June 30, 2018, approximately 95% of our assets consisted of cash, customer receivables, derivative assets, secured loans receivables, precious metals held under financing arrangements and inventory, measured at fair value. Cash generated from the sales of our precious metals products is our primary source of operating liquidity.\nTypically, the Company acquires its inventory by: (1) purchasing inventory from our suppliers by utilizing our own capital and lines of credit; (2) borrowing precious metals from our suppliers under short-term arrangements which may bear interest at a designated rate, and (3) repurchasing inventory at an agreed-upon price based on the spot price on the specified repurchase date.\nIn addition to selling inventory, the Company generates cash from earning interest income. Through CFC, the Company enters into secured loans and secured financing structures with its customers under which it charges interest. The Company offers a number of secured financing options to its customers to finance their precious metals purchases including consignments and other structured inventory finance products. The loans are secured by precious metals and numismatic material owned by the borrowers and held by the Company as security for the term of the loan. Furthermore, our customers may enter into agreements whereby the customer agrees to repurchase our precious metals at the prevailing spot price for delivery of the product at a specific point in time in the future; interest income is earned from the contract date until the material is delivered and paid for in full.\nWe continually review our overall credit and capital needs to ensure that our capital base, both stockholders' equity and available credit facilities, can appropriately support our anticipated financing needs. The Company also continually monitors its current and forecasted cash requirements, and draws upon and pays down its lines of credit so as to minimize interest expense.\nLines of Credit\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>in thousands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2018 Compared to June 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lines of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>180,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA-Mark has a borrowing facility (\"Trading Credit Facility\") with a syndicate of banks, Co\u00f6peratieve Rabobank U.A. (\"Rabobank\") acting as lead lender and administrative agent for the syndicate. As of June 30, 2018, the Trading Credit Facility provided the Company with access up to $260.0 million, featuring a $210.0 million base, with a $50.0 million accordion option. The Trading Credit Facility is scheduled to mature on March 29, 2019. The Company believes that the Trading Credit Facility provides adequate means to capital for its operations (see Note 14).\nDebt Obligation (Related Party)\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>in thousands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2018 Compared to June 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt Obligation - related party\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company entered into a privately placed credit facility in the amount of $7.5 million (the Goldline Credit Facility\u201d) with various lenders (see Note 14). The outstanding principal and unpaid interest is due upon maturity (August 28, 2020). Borrowings under the Goldline Credit Facility were used to finance a portion of the consideration payable pursuant to the Goldline acquisition (see Note 1).\nLiability on Borrowed Metals\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>in thousands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2018 Compared to June 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liability on borrowed metals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>280,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>274,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe borrow precious metals (usually in the form of pool metals) from our suppliers and customers under short-term arrangements using other precious metal from our inventory as collateral. Amounts under these arrangements require repayment either in the form of precious metals or cash. Liabilities also arise from unallocated metal positions held by customers in our inventory. Typically, these positions are due on demand, in a specified physical form, based on the total ounces of metal held in the position. The $274.7 million increase in the balance of liability on borrowed metals from $5.6 million as of June 30, 2017 to $280.3 million as of June 30, 2018 was due primarily to metals borrowed from a third party to finance repurchase agreements with a related party.\nProduct Financing Arrangements\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>in thousands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2018 Compared to June 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product financing arrangements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>135,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(21,403\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company has agreements with financial institutions and other third parties that allows the Company to transfer its gold and silver inventory to the third party at an agreed-upon price based on the spot price, which provides alternative sources of liquidity. During the term of the agreement both parties intend for inventory to be returned at an agreed-upon price based on the spot price on the termination (repurchase) date. The third parties charge monthly interest as a percentage of the market value of the outstanding obligation; such monthly charges are classified in interest expense. These transactions do not qualify as sales and therefore have been accounted for as financing arrangements and reflected in the consolidated balance sheet as product financing arrangements. The obligation is stated at the amount required to repurchase the outstanding inventory. Both the product financing arrangements and the underlying inventory (which is entirely restricted) are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included as a component of cost of sales.\nSecured Loans Table 59: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>in thousands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2018 Compared to June 30, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Secured loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCFC is a California licensed finance lender that makes and acquires commercial loans secured by bullion and numismatic coins that affords our customers a convenient means of financing their inventory or collections (see Note 5). Predominantly, most of the Company's secured loans are short-term in nature and the renewal of these instruments is at the discretion of the Company and, as such, provides us with some flexibility in regards to our capital deployment strategies.\nDividends\nIn fiscal 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company initiated a cash dividend policy that calls for the payment of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per common share. In fiscal 2016, the Board of Directors modified the policy by increasing the quarterly cash dividend to $0.07 per common share, and in fiscal 2017 the quarterly cash dividend was increased to $0.08 per common share (see Note 16).\nThe Board of Directors determined to suspend the Company's quarterly dividend for both the third and fourth fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018 in order to increase its financial flexibility and strengthen its balance sheet. Going forward, the Board of Directors will re-assess its capital resources and may or may not determine to reinstate the dividend based on that assessment.\nCash Flows\nThe majority of the Company's trading activities involve two day value trades under which payment is received in advance of delivery or product is received in advance of payment. The high volume, rapid rate of inventory turnover, and high average value per trade can cause material changes in the sources of cash used in or provided by operating activities on a daily basis. The Company manages these variances through its liquidity forecasts and counterparty limits by maintaining a liquidity reserve to meet the Company's cash needs. The Company uses various short-term financial instruments to manage the rapid cycle of our trading activities from customer purchase order to cash collections and product delivery, which can cause material changes in the amount of cash used in or provided by financing activities on a daily basis.\nThe following summarizes components of our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>in thousands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2018 Compared to June 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,781\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17,832\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(36,487\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(38,767\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur principal capital requirements have been to fund (i) working capital and (ii) capital expenditures. Our working capital requirements fluctuate with market conditions, the availability of precious metals and the volatility of precious metals commodity pricing.\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities\nOperating activities provided $7.6 million and used $9.8 million in cash for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, representing a $17.4 million increase in the source of cash compared to the year ended June 30, 2017. This period over period increase in the of source of funds in operating activities was primarily due to changes in the balances of liability on borrowed metals, accounts payable, deferred income taxes and intangible impairments, offset by changes in the balances of inventory, secured loans, derivative assets, derivative liabilities, income taxes payable, and income taxes receivables.\nNet cash used in investing activities\nInvesting activities used $17.8 million and used $36.5 million in cash for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, representing an $18.7 million decrease in the use of cash compared to the year ended June 30, 2017. This period over period decrease in the use of cash is the result of the change in balance of secured loans of $23.8 million, offset by an increase in the use of cash for corporate acquisition activity of $6.1 million compared to the comparable prior period.\nNet cash provided by financing activities\nFinancing activities provided $3.4 million and provided $42.2 million in cash for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, representing a decrease of $38.8 million in funds provided by financing activities compared to the year ended June 30, 2017. This period over period decrease in funds provided by financing activities was primarily due to changes in the balance of product financing arrangements of $97.4 million, partially offset by the change in the balance of the Trading Credit Facility of $52.0 million and a related party debt obligation of $7.5 million established in the current period.\nCAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, availability under the Trading Credit Facility, product financing arrangements, financing derived from borrowed metals and the cash we anticipate to generate from operating activities will provide us with sufficient liquidity to satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements and commitments through at least the next twelve months.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS\nCounterparty Risk\nWe manage our counterparty risk by setting credit and position risk limits with our trading counterparties. These limits include gross position limits for counterparties engaged in sales and purchase transactions and inventory consignment transactions with us. They also include collateral limits for different types of sale and purchase transactions that counterparties may engage in from time to time.\nCommodities Risk and Derivatives\nWe use a variety of strategies to manage our risk including fluctuations in commodity prices for precious metals. Our inventories consist of, and our trading activities involve, precious metals and precious metal products, whose prices are linked to the corresponding precious metal commodity prices. Inventories purchased or borrowed by us are subject to price changes. Inventories borrowed are considered natural hedges, since changes in value of the metal held are offset by the obligation to return the metal to the supplier or deliver metals to the customer.\nOpen sale and purchase commitments in our trading activities are subject to changes in value between the date the purchase or sale price is fixed (the trade date) and the date the metal is received or delivered (the settlement date). We seek to minimize the effect of price changes of the underlying commodity through the use of forward and futures contracts. Our open sale and purchase commitments generally settle within 2 business days, and for those commitments that do not have stated settlement dates, we have the right to settle the positions upon demand.\nOur policy is to substantially hedge our underlying precious metal commodity inventory position. We regularly enter into metals commodity forward and futures contracts with financial institutions to hedge price changes that would cause changes in the value of our physical metals positions and purchase commitments and sale commitments. We have access to all of the precious metals markets, allowing us to place hedges. However, we also maintain relationships with major market makers in every major precious metals dealing center, which allows us to enter into contracts with market makers. Our forwards contracts open at June 30, 2018 are scheduled to settle within 60 days. Futures positions do not have settlement dates, although the Company typically closes its future positions within a week.\nThe Company enters into these derivative transactions solely for the purpose of hedging our inventory holding risk, and not for speculative market purposes. Due to the nature of our hedging strategy, we are not using hedge accounting as defined under, Derivatives and Hedging Topic 815 of the Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\".) Unrealized gains or losses resulting from our futures and forward contracts are reported as cost of sales with the related amounts due from or to counterparties reflected as a derivative asset or liability. The Company adjusts the derivatives to fair value on a daily basis until the transactions are settled. When these contracts are net settled, the unrealized gains and losses are reversed and the realized gains and losses for forward contracts are recorded in revenue and cost of sales and the net realized gains and losses for futures and option contacts are recorded in cost of sales. The Company's net gains (losses) on derivative instruments for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, totaled $15.6 million and $9.7 million, respectively. These net gains (losses) on derivative instruments were substantially offset by the changes in fair market value of the underlying precious metals inventory and open sale and purchase commitments, which is also recorded in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe purpose of the Company's hedging policy is to substantially match the change in the value of the derivative financial instrument to the change in the value of the underlying hedged item. The following table summarizes the results of our hedging activities, showing the precious metal commodity inventory position, net of open sale and purchase commitments, which is subject to price risk, compared to change in the value of the derivative instruments as of June 30, 2018 and at June 30, 2017:\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>in thousands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventory\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>280,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>284,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Precious metals held under financing arrangements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>262,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>542,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>284,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less unhedgeable inventory:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commemorative coin inventory, held at lower of cost or market\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(99\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premium on metals position\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,530\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,088\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Precious metal value not hedged\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,629\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,128\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>539,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>280,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commitments at market:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Open inventory purchase commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>342,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>587,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Open inventory sales commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(138,022\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(121,602\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Margin sale commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,988\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,936\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In-transit inventory no longer subject to market risk\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,060\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,931\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unhedgeable premiums on open commitment positions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>541\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>495\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Borrowed precious metals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(280,346\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,625\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product financing arrangements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(113,940\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(135,343\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advances on industrial metals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(190,484\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>315,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Precious metal subject to price risk\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>348,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>595,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Precious metal subject to derivative financial instruments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Precious metals forward contracts at market values\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>274,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>462,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Precious metals futures contracts at market values\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>133,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total market value of derivative financial instruments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>347,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>595,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net precious metals subject to commodity price risk\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>175\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe are exposed to the risk of default of the counterparties to our derivative contracts. Significant judgment is applied by us when evaluating the fair value implications. We regularly review the creditworthiness of our major counterparties and monitor our exposure to concentrations. At June 30, 2018, we believe our risk of counterparty default is mitigated based on our evaluation of the creditworthiness of our major counterparties, the strong financial condition of our counterparties, and the short-term duration of these arrangements.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nRefer to Note 15 for information relating Company's commitments and contingencies.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nAs of June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, we had the following outstanding sale and purchase commitments and open forward and future contracts, which are normal and recurring, in nature:\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>in thousands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>342,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>587,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(138,022\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(121,602\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Margin sale commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,988\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,936\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Open forward contracts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>274,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>462,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Open futures contracts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>133,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange forward contracts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe notional amounts of the commodity forward and futures contracts and the open sales and purchase orders, as shown in the table above, are not reflected at the notional amounts in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company records commodity forward and futures contracts at the fair value, which is the difference between the market price of the underlying metal or contract measured on the reporting date and the trade amount measured on the date the contract was transacted. The fair value of the open derivative contracts are shown as a component of derivative assets or derivative liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company enters into the derivative forward and future transactions solely for the purpose of hedging its inventory holding risk, and not for speculative market purposes. The Company's gains (losses) on derivative instruments are substantially offset by the changes in fair market value of the underlying precious metals inventory position, including our open sale and purchase commitments. The Company records the derivatives at the trade date, and any corresponding unrealized gains or losses are shown as a component of cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. We adjust the carrying value of the derivatives to fair value on a daily basis until the transactions are physically settled (see Note 11.)\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that we believe to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review our accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could materially differ from our estimates.\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company accounts for its metals and sales contracts using settlement date accounting. Pursuant to such accounting, the Company recognizes the sale or purchase of the metals at settlement date. During the period between the trade and settlement dates, the Company has entered into a forward contract that meets the definition of a derivative in accordance with the Derivatives and Hedging Topic 815 of the ASC. The Company records the derivative at the trade date with any corresponding unrealized gain (loss), shown as component of cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company adjusts the derivatives to fair value on a daily basis until the transactions are settled. When these contracts are settled, the unrealized gains and losses are reversed, and revenue is recognized for contracts that are physically settled. For contracts that are net settled, the realized gains and losses are recorded in cost of sales, with the exception of forward contracts, where their associated realized gain and losses are recorded in revenue and cost of sales, respectively.\nInventories\nThe Company's inventories primarily include bullion and bullion coins, which are initially recorded at fair market value. The fair market value of the bullion and bullion coins is comprised of two components: (1) published market values attributable to the cost of the raw precious metal, and (2) a published premium paid at acquisition of the metal. The premium is attributable to the additional value of the product in its finished goods form and the market value attributable solely to the premium may be readily determined, as it is published by multiple reputable sources. The premium is included in the cost of the inventory, paid at acquisition, and is a component of the total fair market value of the inventory. The precious metal component of the inventory may be hedged through the use of precious metal commodity positions, while the premium component of our inventory is not a commodity that may be hedged.\nThe Company's inventories, except for certain lower of cost or market basis products (as described below), are subsequently recorded at their fair market values. The daily changes in the fair market value of our inventory are offset by daily changes in the fair market value of hedging derivatives that are taken with respect to our inventory positions; both the change in the fair market value of the inventory and the change in the fair market value of these derivative instruments are recorded in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations.\nWhile the premium component included in inventories is marked-to-market, our commemorative coin inventory, including its premium component, is held at the lower of cost or market, because the value of commemorative coins is influenced more by supply and demand determinants than on the underlying spot price of the precious metal content of the commemorative coins. Unlike our bullion coins, the value of commemorative coins is not subject to the same level of volatility as bullion coins because our commemorative coins typically carry a substantially higher premium over the spot metal price than bullion coins. Additionally, neither the commemorative coin inventory nor the premium component of our inventory is hedged.\nInventories include amounts borrowed from suppliers and customers arising from various arrangements including unallocated metal positions held by customers in the Company's inventory, amounts due to suppliers for the use of consigned inventory, metals held by suppliers as collateral on advanced pool metals, as well as shortages in unallocated metal positions held by the Company in the supplier's inventory. Unallocated or pool metal represents an unsegregated inventory position that is due on demand, in a specified physical form, based on the total ounces of metal held in the position. Amounts under these arrangements require delivery either in the form of precious metals or cash. The Company mitigates market risk of its physical inventories and open commitments through commodity hedge transactions (see Note 11.)\nThe Company enters into product financing agreements for the transfer and subsequent option to reacquire its gold and silver inventory at an agreed-upon price based on the spot price with a third party finance company. This inventory is restricted and is held at a custodial storage facility in exchange for a financing fee, charged by the third party finance company. During the term of the financing agreement, the third party company holds the inventory as collateral, and both parties intend for the inventory to be returned to the Company at an agreed-upon price based on the spot price on the termination (repurchase) date. The third party charges a monthly fee as percentage of the market value of the outstanding obligation; such monthly charge is classified as interest expense. These transactions do not qualify as sales and have been accounted for as financing arrangements in accordance with ASC 470-40 Product Financing Arrangements, and are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as product financing arrangements. The obligation is stated at the amount required to repurchase the outstanding inventory. Both the product financing and the underlying inventory (which is restricted) are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Company periodically loans metals to customers on a short-term consignment basis. Such inventories are removed at the time the customer elects to price and purchase the metals, and the Company records a corresponding sale and receivable.\nThe Company enters into financing arrangements with certain customers under which A-Mark purchases precious metals products that are subject to repurchase by the customer at the fair value of the product on the repurchase date. The Company or the counterparty may typically terminate any such arrangement with 14 days' notice. Upon termination the customer's rights to repurchase any remaining inventory is forfeited.\nGoodwill and Other Purchased Intangible Assets\nWe evaluate goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year (or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist) in accordance with the Intangibles - Goodwill and Other Topic 350 of the ASC. Other finite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. We may first qualitatively assess whether relevant events and circumstances make it more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is less than its carrying value. If, based on this qualitative assessment, we determine that goodwill is more likely than not to be impaired, a quantitative impairment test is performed. This step requires us to determine the fair value of the business, and compare the calculated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If through this quantitative analysis the Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired. If the Company concludes that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a goodwill impairment will be recognized\nfor the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value.\nThe Company also performs impairment reviews on its indefinite-lived intangible assets (i.e., trademarks and trade-names). In assessing its indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether events or circumstances exist that lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, the Company is not required to perform any additional tests in assessing the asset for impairment. However, if the Company concludes otherwise or elects not to perform the qualitative assessment, then it is required to perform a quantitative analysis to determine if the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value. If through a quantitative analysis the Company determines the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its carrying amount, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is considered not to be impaired. If the Company concludes that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, an impairment will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value.\nIncome Taxes\nAs part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements, the Company is required to estimate its provision for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which it conducts business, in accordance with the Income Taxes Topic 740 of the ASC (\"ASC 740\"). The Company computes its annual tax rate based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to it in the various jurisdictions in which it earns income. Significant judgment is required in determining the Company's annual tax rate and in evaluating uncertainty in its tax positions. The Company recognizes a benefit for tax positions that it believes will more likely than not be sustained upon examination. The amount of benefit recognized is the largest amount of benefit that the Company believes has more than a 50% probability of being realized upon settlement. The Company regularly monitors its tax positions and adjusts the amount of recognized tax benefit based on its evaluation of information that has become available since the end of its last financial reporting period. The annual tax rate includes the impact of these changes in recognized tax benefits. When adjusting the amount of recognized tax benefits, the Company does not consider information that has become available after the balance sheet date, but does disclose the effects of new information whenever those effects would be material to the Company's consolidated financial statements. The difference between the amount of benefit taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the amount of benefit recognized for financial reporting represents unrecognized tax benefits. These unrecognized tax benefits are presented in the consolidated balance sheets principally within accrued liabilities.\nThe Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes under the provisions of ASC 740. These provisions clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements, and prescribe a recognition threshold and measurement criteria for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The provisions also provide guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest, and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The potential interest and/or penalties associated with an uncertain tax position are recorded in provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations. Please refer to Note 12 for further discussion regarding these provisions.\nIncome taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include the Company's forecast of the reversal of temporary differences, future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in applicable tax jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the Company's effective tax rate on future earnings.\nThe Company records valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Significant judgment is applied when assessing the need for valuation allowances. Areas of estimation include the Company's consideration of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the utilization of deferred tax assets in future years, the Company would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or charge to income. Changes in recognized tax benefits and changes in valuation allowances could be material to the Company's results of operations for any period, but is not expected to be material to the Company's consolidated financial position. Based on our assessment it appears more likely than not that all of the net deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable income.\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements recognized the current and deferred income tax consequences that result from the Company's activities during the current and preceding periods, as if the Company were a separate taxpayer prior to the date of the Distribution of the company when it was a member of the consolidated income tax return group of its Former Parent\n(Spectrum Group International, Inc.) Following its spin-off, the Company files federal and state income tax filings that are separate from the Former Parent's tax filings. The Company recognizes current and deferred income taxes as a separate taxpayer for periods ending after the date of Distribution.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company evaluates each purchase transaction to determine whether the acquired assets meet the definition of a business. The Company accounts for business combinations by applying the acquisition method in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations. Transaction costs related to acquisition of a business are expensed as incurred and excluded from the fair value of consideration transferred. The identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interests, if any, in an acquired entity are recognized and measured at their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair values of identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interests, if any, in an acquired entity, net of fair value of any previously held interest in the acquired entity, is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets and liabilities.\nContingent Earn-out Liability\nContingent consideration is classified as a liability or equity, as applicable. Contingent consideration in connection with the acquisition of a business is measured at fair value on acquisition date, and unless classified as equity, is remeasured at fair value each reporting period thereafter until the consideration is settled, with changes in fair value included in net income.\nWe record an estimate of the fair value of contingent consideration, related to the earn-out obligations to SilverTowne LP related to SilverTowne Mint transaction. On a quarterly basis, we revalue the liability and record increases or decreases in the fair value as an adjustment to earnings. Changes to the contingent consideration liability can result from adjustments to the discount rate, or from changes to the estimates of future throughput activity of AMST, which are considered Level 3 inputs (see Note 3). Consequentially, the assumptions used in estimating fair value require significant judgment. The use of different assumptions and judgments could result in a materially different estimate of fair value.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nFor a description of accounting changes and recent

We offer gold, silver, platinum and palladium in the form of bars, plates, powder, wafers, grain, ingots and coins. Our Industrial unit services manufacturers and fabricators of products utilizing or incorporating precious metals. Our Coin and Bar unit deals in over 200 coin and bar products in a variety of weights, shapes and sizes for distribution to dealers and other qualified purchasers. We have trading centers in El Segundo, California and Vienna, Austria for buying and selling precious metals, which are open 24 hours each trading day, even when many major world commodity markets are closed. In addition to wholesale trading activity, A-Mark offers its customers a variety of services, including financing, storage, consignment, logistics and various customized financial programs. As a U.S. Mint-authorized purchaser of gold, silver and platinum coins, A-Mark purchases product directly from the U.S. Mint and other sovereign mints for sale to its customers.\nThrough our wholly-owned subsidiary Transcontinental Depository Services, referred to as TDS, we offer a variety of managed storage options for precious metals products to financial institutions, dealers, investors and collectors around the world. Our storage business generated less than 1% of total revenues for each of the periods presented.\nThe Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, A-M Global Logistics, LLC, referred to as Logistics, commenced operations as a logistics fulfillment center in July 2015. Logistics, based in Las Vegas, Nevada, provides our customers an array of complementary services, including receiving, handling, inventorying, processing, packing, and shipping of precious metals and custom coins on a secure basis. Our logistics business generated less than 1% of the total revenues for each of the periods presented.\nIn August 2016, the Company formed AMST, a joint venture with SilverTowne, L.P., referred to as SilverTowne, an Indiana-based producer of minted silver. As of June 30, 2018, the Company and SilverTowne, L.P. own 55% and 45%, respectively, of AMST. AMST acquired the entire minting operations (referred to as SilverTowne Mint) of SilverTowne, L.P., with the goal of providing greater product selection to our customers and greater pricing stability within the supply chain, as well as to gain increased access to silver during volatile market environments, which have historically resulted in higher demand for precious metals products.\nSecured Lending Segment\nThe Company operates its Secured Lending segment through its wholly-owned subsidiary, CFC. CFC has been in operation since 2005.\nCFC is a California licensed finance lender that originates and acquires commercial loans secured by bullion and numismatic coins. CFC's customers include coin and precious metal dealers, investors and collectors. As of June 30, 2018, CFC had approximately $110.4 million in secured loans outstanding, of which approximately 67.6% was originated by third parties and acquired by CFC and approximately 32.4% was originated by CFC.\nDirect Sales Segment\nThe Company operates its Direct Sales segment through its wholly-owned subsidiary Goldline Inc. ( Goldline\u201d). The Company acquired the business in August 2017 through an asset purchase transaction with Goldline LLC (see Note 1.) Goldline LLC had been in operation since 1960.\nGoldline is a direct retailer of precious metals to the investor community. Goldline markets its precious metal products primarily on radio, the internet and television, as well as through telephonic sales efforts, particularly to Goldline's repeat customers. The Company acquired the Goldline business with the objective of enhancing the Company's distribution capabilities by adding a direct-to-client distribution channel. The Company also anticipated that the acquisition would diversify the product and services offering to Goldline customers, through access to the Company's wider assortment of precious metal coins and bars, including CFC's secured lending services and TDS's storage and asset protection services. Since the acquisition, the Company has been focused on rationalizing the cost structure of the Goldline business to promote profitability.\nOur Strategy\nThe Company has grown from a small numismatics firm in 1965 to a significant participant in the bullion and coin markets, with approximately $7.6 billion and $7.0 billion in revenues for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our strategy continues to focus on growth, including the volume of our business, our geographic presence, particularly in Europe, and the scope of complementary products, services and technological tools that we offer to our customers. We intend to promote our growth by leveraging off the strengths of our existing integrated operations: the depth of our customer relations; our access to market makers, suppliers and government mints and other mints; our trading systems in the U.S. and Europe, are available 24 hours a day 7 days a week; our expansive precious metals dealer network; our depository relationships around the world; our knowledge of secured lending; our logistics capabilities; our trading expertise; and the quality and experience of our management team.\nOur Customers\nOur customers include financial institutions, bullion retailers, industrial manufacturers and fabricators, sovereign mints, refiners, coin and metal dealers, investors and collectors. The Company makes a two way market, which results in many customers also operating as our suppliers. This diverse base of customers purchases a variety of products from the Company in a multitude of grades, primarily in the form of coins and bars.\nFactors Affecting Revenues, Gross Profits, Interest Income and Interest Expense\nRevenues. The Company enters into transactions to sell and deliver gold, silver, platinum and palladium to industrial and commercial users, coin and bullion dealers, mints, and financial institutions. The metals are investment or industrial grade and are sold in a variety of shapes and sizes.\nThe Company also sells precious metals on forward contracts at a fixed price based on current prevailing precious metal spot prices with a certain delivery date in the future (up to six months from date of the forward contract.) Typically, these forward contracts are net settled against our other forward positions or are settled in cash, whereby no physical product is delivered. Sales on forward contracts can be a substantial portion of revenues in any given period. We enter into these forward contacts as part of our hedging strategy to mitigate our price risk of holding inventory; they are not entered into for speculative purposes.\nIn addition, the Company earns revenue by providing storage solutions for precious metals and numismatic coins for financial institutions, dealers, investors and collectors worldwide and by providing storage and order-fulfillment services to our retail customers. These revenue streams are complementary to our trading activity, and represent less than 1% of our revenues.\nThe Company operates in a high volume/low margin industry. Revenues are impacted by three primary factors: product volume, market prices and market volatility. A material change in any one or more of these factors may result in a significant change in the Company's revenues. A significant increase or decrease in revenues can occur simply based on changes in the underlying commodity prices and may not be reflective of an increase or decrease in the volume of products sold.\nGross Profits. Gross profit is the difference between our revenues and the cost of our products. Since we quote prices based on the current commodity market prices for precious metals, we enter into a combination of forward and futures contracts to effect a hedge position equal to the underlying precious metal commodity value, which substantially represents inventory subject to price risk. We enter into these derivative transactions solely for the purpose of hedging our inventory, and not for speculative purposes. Our gross profit includes the gains and losses resulting from these derivative instruments. However, the gains and losses on the derivative instruments are substantially offset by the gains and losses on the corresponding changes in the market value of our precious metals inventory. As a result, our results of operations generally are not materially impacted solely by changes in commodity prices.\nVolatility also affects our gross profits. Greater volatility typically causes the trading spreads to widen resulting in an increase in the gross profit. Product supply constraints during extended periods of higher volatility has historically resulted in a heightening of wider trading spreads resulting in further improvement in the gross profit.\nInterest Income. The Company enters into secured loans and secured financing structures with its customers under which it charges interest. Through its wholly owned subsidiary, CFC, the Company also enters into loans secured by precious metals and numismatic material owned by the borrowers and held by the Company for the term of the loan. The Company offers a number of secured financing options to its customers to finance their precious metals purchases including consignments and other structured inventory finance products whereby the Company earns a fee based on the underlying value of the precious metal.\nInterest Expense. The Company incurs interest expense as a result of usage under its lines of credit and related-party debt. The Company also incurs interest expense as a result of its product financing agreements for the transfer and subsequent re-acquisition of gold and silver at a fixed price with a third-party finance company, and may incur interest expense when we borrow precious metals from our suppliers under short-term arrangements, which can bear interest at a designated rate.\nPerformance Metrics\nIn addition to financial statement indicators, management also utilizes certain key operational metrics to assess the performance of our business.\nWe look at the number of ounces of gold and silver sold and delivered to our customers (excluding ounces recorded on forward contracts). These metrics reflect our business volume without regard to changes in commodity pricing, which also impacts revenue and can mask actual business trends.\nAnother measure of our business volume, unaffected by changes in commodity pricing, is Wholesale Trading & Ancillary Services segment ticket volume and Direct Sales segment ticket volume, which is the total number of orders processed by our trading desks in El Segundo, California and Vienna, Austria. In periods of higher volatility, there is generally increased trading in the commodity markets, and increased demand for our products, which translates into higher business volume. Generally, the ounces sold on a per-trading-ticket basis is substantially higher for orders placed telephonically compared to those placed on our online portal platform.\nInventory turnover is another performance measure on which we are focused. We define inventory turnover as the cost of sales during the relevant period divided by the average inventory during the period. Inventory turnover is a measure of how quickly inventory has moved during the period. A higher inventory turnover ratio, which we typically experience during periods of higher volatility when trading is more robust, reflects a more efficient use of our capital.\nFinally, as a measure of the size of our secured lending segment, we look at the number of outstanding secured loans to customers at the end of the fiscal quarter.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year end is June 30 each year. Unless otherwise stated, references to years in this report relate to fiscal years rather than to calendar years.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview of Results of Operations for the Years Ended June 30, 2018 and 2017\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe operating results of our business for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:\n\n\nRevenues\n\nRevenues for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased $616.6 million, or 8.8%, to $7.606 billion from $6.990 billion in 2017. Our revenues increased primarily due to higher gold prices and forward sales, offset by a decrease in the total amount of gold and silver ounces sold, and silver prices.\nGold ounces sold for the year ended June 30, 2018 decreased 259,000 ounces, or 11.9%, to 1,912,000 ounces from 2,171,000 ounces in 2017. Silver ounces sold for the year ended June 30, 2018 decreased 33,118,000 ounces, or 41.6%, to 46,466,000 ounces from 79,584,000 ounces in 2017. On average, the prices for gold increased by 2.8% and prices for silver decreased by 5.3% during the year ended June 30, 2018 as compared to 2017.\nGross Profit\n\nGross profit for the year ended June 30, 2018 decreased by $1.9 million, or 6.0%, to $29.4 million from $31.3 million in 2017. Overall gross profit decreased due to subdued market conditions (e.g., lower gold and silver sales volume, margins and trading profits ) compared to the prior fiscal year, offset by gross profit of the newly acquired Direct Sales segment (i.e., Goldline).\nThe Company's gross margin percentage decreased by 13.6% to 0.387% from 0.448% in 2017. The drop in gross margin percentage was largely attributable to lower margins resulting from subdued market conditions, higher forward sales, which increase revenues but are associated with negligible gross margin percentages (i.e., near zero) that lowers the overall percentage and lower trading profits, offset by gross margin of the newly acquired Direct Sales segment (i.e., Goldline). The Company enters into forward contracts to hedge its precious metals price risk exposure and not for speculative purposes.\nOur inventory turnover rate for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased by 1.9%, to 26.8 from 26.3 in 2017. The inventory turnover rate for fiscal 2018 was fairly consistent with fiscal 2017.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased $10.1 million, or 43.1%, to $33.4 million from $23.3 million in 2017. The change was primarily due to new selling, general and administrative expense related to our newly acquired Direct Sales segment (Goldline) of $10.6 million (which included $0.6 million of severance expense), $0.6 million of non-recurring legal expense, $0.8 million of professional consulting fees, partially offset by a $1.0 million reduction to incentive compensation expense and $0.3 million of investigatory acquisition costs.\nGoodwill and intangible asset impairment\n\nGoodwill and intangible asset impairment for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased $2.7 million to $2.7 million from zero in 2017. The change was due to our annual impairment assessment we conducted in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, which was related to our Direct Sales segment (Goldline).\nInterest Income\n\nInterest income for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased $3.6 million, or 28.3%, to $16.1 million from $12.6 million in 2017. Interest income from our Secured Lending segment increased by $1.9 million or by 24.5% in comparison to the same year-ago period, which represents approximately 53.3% of the aggregate increase. This increase in interest from secured loans was primarily due to increases in interest rates and an increase in the aggregate value of the secured loan portfolio. The number of secured loans outstanding increased by 47.7% to 3,507 from 2,375 in 2017.\nThe aggregate increase in interest income also increased due to other finance product income. Our finance fees earned related to repurchase arrangements with customers increased by 25.1% or by $1.1 million in comparison to the same year-ago period, which represent approximately 32.3% of the aggregate increase.\nInterest Expense\n\nInterest expense for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased $3.8 million, or 37.3% to $13.9 million from $10.1 million in 2017. The increase was related primarily to a greater usage of our Trading Credit Facility, our new related-party debt financing agreement associated with our acquisition of Goldline, higher LIBOR interest rates that went in to effect subsequent to the Federal Reserve rate increases, and increased third-party loan servicing fees. As compared to the same year-ago period, the following interest expense components increased by (i) $1.8 million or 24.8% related to the Trading Credit Facility (including debt amortization costs), (ii) $0.6 million related to the Goldline Credit Facility, (iii) $0.4 million, or 27.7% related to third-party loan processing fees for acquired secured loans, (iv) $0.3 million related to our liability on borrowed metal balances, and (v) $0.6 million or 40.8% related to product financing agreements with our customers.\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\nOur provision for income taxes was $0.0 million and $3.7 million for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our effective tax rate was approximately 0.2% and 34.5% for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our effective tax rate for the year ended June 30, 2018 differs from the federal statutory rate of 28.06% primarily due to the tax impact of a one-time revaluation of net deferred tax assets to reflect their value at the reduced corporate tax rate under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\"). Our effective tax rate for the year ended June 30, 2017 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to favorable tax attributes and deductions resulting from amended state tax filings based on the settlement of the Former parent's tax examination in the years when the Company was included in a consolidated filing. These favorable attributes are allocated to the standalone Company. The change in effective tax rate was also partially due to non-deductible transaction costs in the prior year that become deductible in the current year when the transaction was abandoned.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act\nOn December 22, 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which significantly changed the existing US tax laws, including a reduction in the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result of the enactment of the legislation, the Company incurred a provisional one-time tax expense of $1.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2018, primarily related to the re-measurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company incurred a tax benefit from operations (both recurring and non-recurring) which is largely offset by a one-time revaluation adjustment under TCJA of $1.2 million for year ended June 30, 2018.\nSegment Results of Operations\nThe Company conducts its operations in three reportable segments: (1) Wholesale Trading & Ancillary Services, (2) Secured Lending and (3) Direct Sales. Each of these reportable segments represents an aggregation of operating segments that meets the aggregation criteria set forth in the Segment Reporting Topic 280 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d).\nResults of Operations - Wholesale Trading & Ancillary Services Segment\nOverview of Results of Operations for the Years Ended June 30, 2018 and 2017\nThe operating results of our Wholesale Trading & Ancillary Services segment for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:\n\n _________________________________ NM Not meaningful.

(3) Trading ticket volume represents the total number of product orders processed by our trading desks in El Segundo, California and Vienna, Austria, for the Wholesale Trading & Ancillary Services segment. \nRevenues - Wholesale Trading & Ancillary Services\n\nRevenues for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased $549.2 million, or 7.9%, to $7.539 billion from $6.990 billion in 2017. Our revenues increased primarily due to higher gold prices and forward sales, offset by a decrease in the total amount of gold and silver ounces sold, and silver prices.\nGold ounces sold for the year ended June 30, 2018 decreased 276,000 ounces, or 12.7%, to 1,895,000 ounces from 2,171,000 ounces in 2017. Silver ounces sold for the year ended June 30, 2018 decreased 33,539,000 ounces, or 42.1%, to 46,045,000 ounces from 79,584,000 ounces in 2017. On average, the prices for gold increased by 2.5% and prices for silver decreased by 5.6% during the year ended June 30, 2018 as compared to 2017.\nGross Profit - Wholesale Trading & Ancillary Services\n\nGross profit for the year ended June 30, 2018 decreased by $7.2 million, or 23.1%, to $24.1 million from $31.3 million in 2017. Overall gross profit decreased due to subdued market conditions (e.g., lower gold and silver sales volume, margins and trading profits) compared to the prior fiscal year.\nThe Company's profit margin percentage decreased by 28.6% to 0.320% from 0.448% in 2017 and was largely attributable lower margins resulting from subdued market conditions and higher forward contracts, which increase revenues but have negligible impact on the gross margin (i.e., near zero) that lowers the overall percentage and lower trading profits. The Company enters into forward contracts to hedge its precious metals price risk exposure and not for speculative purposes. Excluding the effects of forwards sales and trading profits on the gross margin, gross margin percentage related to physical trades decreased by 4.3%.\nThe wholesale trading ticket volume for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased by 2,028 tickets, or 1.8%, to 114,935 tickets from 112,907 tickets in 2017. The increase in our trading ticket volume was primarily the result of an increase in customer usage of our online portal. Generally, the quantity-size (i.e., ounces) of customer orders placed through the portal is less than the quantity size of orders processed through our trading desk.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses - Wholesale Trading & Ancillary Services\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2018 decreased $0.4 million, or 2.0%, to $21.1 million from $21.5 million in 2017.The decrease was primarily due to lower selling, general and administrative expense related to a $1.0 million reduction to incentive compensation expense, partially offset by $0.4 million non-recurring legal expense.\nInterest Income - Wholesale Trading & Ancillary Services\n\nInterest income for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased $1.7 million, or 34.5%, to $6.5 million from $4.8 million in 2017. The aggregate increase in interest income increased due to other finance product income. Our finance fees earned from repurchase arrangements with customers increased by 25.1% or by $1.1 million in comparison to the same year-ago period.\nInterest Expense - Wholesale Trading & Ancillary Services\n\nInterest expense for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased $1.6 million, or 25.9% to $7.8 million from $6.2 million in 2017. The increase was related primarily to a greater usage of our lines of credit, and higher LIBOR interest rates that went in to effect subsequent to the Federal Reserve rate increases. As compared to the same year-ago period, the following interest expense components increased by (i) $0.6 million, or 13.6% related to our Trading Credit Facility (including debt amortization costs), (ii) $0.3 million related to our liability on borrowed metal balances, and (iii) $0.6 million or 40.8% related to product financing agreements.\nResults of Operations - Secured Lending Segment\nThe operating results of our Secured Lending segment for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:\n\n \nInterest Income - Secured Lending \nInterest income for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased $1.9 million, or 24.5%, to $9.6 million from $7.7 million in 2017. This increase was primarily due to increases in interest rates and aggregate value of the secured loan portfolio. The number of secured loans outstanding increased by 47.7% to 3,507 from 2,375 in 2017, which is indicative of the growth in this business segment.\nInterest Expense - Secured Lending \nInterest expense for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased $1.524 million, or 38.7% to $5.5 million from $3.9 million in 2017. The increase was related primarily to a greater usage of the Company's Trading Credit Facility, higher LIBOR interest rates that went in to effect subsequent to the Federal Reserve rate increases, and increased third-party loan servicing fees. As compared to the same year-ago period, the following interest expense components increased by (i) $1.2 million or 44.0% related to Trading Credit Facility (including debt amortization costs), and (ii) $0.3 million or 27.6% related to third-party loan servicing costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses - Secured Lending \nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2018 decreased $0.1 million, or (6.9)%, to $1.7 million from $1.8 million in 2017.\nResults of Operations - Direct Sales Segment\nOverview of Results of Operations for the Years Ended June 30, 2018 and 2017\nThe Direct Sales segment was created on August 28, 2017 as a result of the Goldline acquisition. Accordingly, comparative prior period data is not available. The operating results of our Direct Sales segment for the year ended June 30, 2018 are as follows:\n\n _________________________________ (a) Includes $22.5 million of intercompany sales from the Direct Sales segment to the Wholesale Trading & Ancillary Services segment. (b) Gross profit percentage, excluding intercompany sales from the Direct Sales segment to the Wholesale Trading & Ancillary Services segment, is 15.26% for the twelve-month period. (1) Gold ounces sold represents the ounces of gold product sold to third-party customers during fiscal year. (2) Silver ounces sold represents the ounces of silver product sold to third-party customer during the fiscal year. (3) Direct Sales segment trading ticket volume represents the total number of product orders processed. \nSegment Results - Direct Sales\nRevenues for the year ended June 30, 2018 were $67.4 million. The total amount of gold and silver sold to third-party customers was 17,000 ounces and 421,000 ounces, respectively. Gross profit for the year ended June 30, 2018 was $5.3 million. Selling, general and administration expenses for the year ended June 30, 2018 was $10.6 million, which includes $0.6 million of severance costs. The Company is working to improve business performance with expanded marketing programs and greater leverage of the Wholesale Trading and Ancillary Services segment's products & services to enhance revenue and margins. The Company is also optimizing selling, general and administration expenses to align with current market conditions and promote profitability.\nLIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION\nPrimary Sources and Uses of Cash\nOverview\nLiquidity is defined as our ability to generate sufficient amounts of cash to meet all of our cash needs. Liquidity is of critical importance to us and imperative to maintain our operations on a daily basis.\nA substantial portion of our assets are liquid. As of June 30, 2018, approximately 95% of our assets consisted of cash, customer receivables, derivative assets, secured loans receivables, precious metals held under financing arrangements and inventory, measured at fair value. Cash generated from the sales of our precious metals products is our primary source of operating liquidity.\nTypically, the Company acquires its inventory by: (1) purchasing inventory from our suppliers by utilizing our own capital and lines of credit; (2) borrowing precious metals from our suppliers under short-term arrangements which may bear interest at a designated rate, and (3) repurchasing inventory at an agreed-upon price based on the spot price on the specified repurchase date.\nIn addition to selling inventory, the Company generates cash from earning interest income. Through CFC, the Company enters into secured loans and secured financing structures with its customers under which it charges interest. The Company offers a number of secured financing options to its customers to finance their precious metals purchases including consignments and other structured inventory finance products. The loans are secured by precious metals and numismatic material owned by the borrowers and held by the Company as security for the term of the loan. Furthermore, our customers may enter into agreements whereby the customer agrees to repurchase our precious metals at the prevailing spot price for delivery of the product at a specific point in time in the future; interest income is earned from the contract date until the material is delivered and paid for in full.\nWe continually review our overall credit and capital needs to ensure that our capital base, both stockholders' equity and available credit facilities, can appropriately support our anticipated financing needs. The Company also continually monitors its current and forecasted cash requirements, and draws upon and pays down its lines of credit so as to minimize interest expense.\nLines of Credit\n\nA-Mark has a borrowing facility (\"Trading Credit Facility\") with a syndicate of banks, Co\u00f6peratieve Rabobank U.A. (\"Rabobank\") acting as lead lender and administrative agent for the syndicate. As of June 30, 2018, the Trading Credit Facility provided the Company with access up to $260.0 million, featuring a $210.0 million base, with a $50.0 million accordion option. The Trading Credit Facility is scheduled to mature on March 29, 2019. The Company believes that the Trading Credit Facility provides adequate means to capital for its operations (see Note 14).\nDebt Obligation (Related Party)\n\nThe Company entered into a privately placed credit facility in the amount of $7.5 million (the Goldline Credit Facility\u201d) with various lenders (see Note 14). The outstanding principal and unpaid interest is due upon maturity (August 28, 2020). Borrowings under the Goldline Credit Facility were used to finance a portion of the consideration payable pursuant to the Goldline acquisition (see Note 1).\nLiability on Borrowed Metals\n\nWe borrow precious metals (usually in the form of pool metals) from our suppliers and customers under short-term arrangements using other precious metal from our inventory as collateral. Amounts under these arrangements require repayment either in the form of precious metals or cash. Liabilities also arise from unallocated metal positions held by customers in our inventory. Typically, these positions are due on demand, in a specified physical form, based on the total ounces of metal held in the position. The $274.7 million increase in the balance of liability on borrowed metals from $5.6 million as of June 30, 2017 to $280.3 million as of June 30, 2018 was due primarily to metals borrowed from a third party to finance repurchase agreements with a related party.\nProduct Financing Arrangements\n\nThe Company has agreements with financial institutions and other third parties that allows the Company to transfer its gold and silver inventory to the third party at an agreed-upon price based on the spot price, which provides alternative sources of liquidity. During the term of the agreement both parties intend for inventory to be returned at an agreed-upon price based on the spot price on the termination (repurchase) date. The third parties charge monthly interest as a percentage of the market value of the outstanding obligation; such monthly charges are classified in interest expense. These transactions do not qualify as sales and therefore have been accounted for as financing arrangements and reflected in the consolidated balance sheet as product financing arrangements. The obligation is stated at the amount required to repurchase the outstanding inventory. Both the product financing arrangements and the underlying inventory (which is entirely restricted) are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included as a component of cost of sales.\nSecured Loans \nCFC is a California licensed finance lender that makes and acquires commercial loans secured by bullion and numismatic coins that affords our customers a convenient means of financing their inventory or collections (see Note 5). Predominantly, most of the Company's secured loans are short-term in nature and the renewal of these instruments is at the discretion of the Company and, as such, provides us with some flexibility in regards to our capital deployment strategies.\nDividends\nIn fiscal 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company initiated a cash dividend policy that calls for the payment of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per common share. In fiscal 2016, the Board of Directors modified the policy by increasing the quarterly cash dividend to $0.07 per common share, and in fiscal 2017 the quarterly cash dividend was increased to $0.08 per common share (see Note 16).\nThe Board of Directors determined to suspend the Company's quarterly dividend for both the third and fourth fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018 in order to increase its financial flexibility and strengthen its balance sheet. Going forward, the Board of Directors will re-assess its capital resources and may or may not determine to reinstate the dividend based on that assessment.\nCash Flows\nThe majority of the Company's trading activities involve two day value trades under which payment is received in advance of delivery or product is received in advance of payment. The high volume, rapid rate of inventory turnover, and high average value per trade can cause material changes in the sources of cash used in or provided by operating activities on a daily basis. The Company manages these variances through its liquidity forecasts and counterparty limits by maintaining a liquidity reserve to meet the Company's cash needs. The Company uses various short-term financial instruments to manage the rapid cycle of our trading activities from customer purchase order to cash collections and product delivery, which can cause material changes in the amount of cash used in or provided by financing activities on a daily basis.\nThe following summarizes components of our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017:\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

This section discusses new accounting pronouncements, dates of implementation and impact on our accompanying consolidated financial statements. \nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nOur Business\nWe conduct our operations in three reportable segments: (1) Wholesale Trading & Ancillary Services, (2) Secured Lending and (3) Direct Sales.\nWholesale Trading & Ancillary Services Segment\nThe Wholesale Trading & Ancillary Services segment operates as a full-service precious metals trading company. We offer gold, silver, platinum and palladium in the form of bars, plates, powder, wafers, grain, ingots and coins. Our Industrial unit services manufacturers and fabricators of products utilizing or incorporating precious metals. Our Coin and Bar unit deals in over 200 coin and bar products in a variety of weights, shapes and sizes for distribution to dealers and other qualified purchasers. We have trading centers in El Segundo, California and Vienna, Austria for buying and selling precious metals, which are open 24 hours each trading day, even when many major world commodity markets are closed. In addition to wholesale trading activity, A-Mark offers its customers a variety of services, including financing, storage, consignment, logistics and various customized financial programs. As a U.S. Mint-authorized purchaser of gold, silver and platinum coins, A-Mark purchases product directly from the U.S. Mint and other sovereign mints for sale to its customers.\nThrough our wholly-owned subsidiary Transcontinental Depository Services, referred to as TDS, we offer a variety of managed storage options for precious metals products to financial institutions, dealers, investors and collectors around the world. Our storage business generated less than 1% of total revenues for each of the periods presented.\nThe Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, A-M Global Logistics, LLC, referred to as Logistics, commenced operations as a logistics fulfillment center in July 2015. Logistics, based in Las Vegas, Nevada, provides our customers an array of complementary services, including receiving, handling, inventorying, processing, packing, and shipping of precious metals and custom coins on a secure basis. Our logistics business generated less than 1% of the total revenues for each of the periods presented.\nIn August 2016, the Company formed AMST, a joint venture with SilverTowne, L.P., referred to as SilverTowne, an Indiana-based producer of minted silver. As of June 30, 2018, the Company and SilverTowne, L.P. own 55% and 45%, respectively, of AMST. AMST acquired the entire minting operations (referred to as SilverTowne Mint) of SilverTowne, L.P., with the goal of providing greater product selection to our customers and greater pricing stability within the supply chain, as well as to gain increased access to silver during volatile market environments, which have historically resulted in higher demand for precious metals products.\nSecured Lending Segment\nThe Company operates its Secured Lending segment through its wholly-owned subsidiary, CFC. CFC has been in operation since 2005.\nCFC is a California licensed finance lender that originates and acquires commercial loans secured by bullion and numismatic coins. CFC's customers include coin and precious metal dealers, investors and collectors. As of June 30, 2018, CFC had approximately $110.4 million in secured loans outstanding, of which approximately 67.6% was originated by third parties and acquired by CFC and approximately 32.4% was originated by CFC.\nDirect Sales Segment\nThe Company operates its Direct Sales segment through its wholly-owned subsidiary Goldline Inc. ( Goldline\u201d). The Company acquired the business in August 2017 through an asset purchase transaction with Goldline LLC (see Note 1.) Goldline LLC had been in operation since 1960.\nGoldline is a direct retailer of precious metals to the investor community. Goldline markets its precious metal products primarily on radio, the internet and television, as well as through telephonic sales efforts, particularly to Goldline's repeat customers. The Company acquired the Goldline business with the objective of enhancing the Company's distribution capabilities by adding a direct-to-client distribution channel. The Company also anticipated that the acquisition would diversify the product and services offering to Goldline customers, through access to the Company's wider assortment of precious metal coins and bars, including CFC's secured lending services and TDS's storage and asset protection services. Since the acquisition, the Company has been focused on rationalizing the cost structure of the Goldline business to promote profitability.\nOur Strategy\nThe Company has grown from a small numismatics firm in 1965 to a significant participant in the bullion and coin markets, with approximately $7.6 billion and $7.0 billion in revenues for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our strategy continues to focus on growth, including the volume of our business, our geographic presence, particularly in Europe, and the scope of complementary products, services and technological tools that we offer to our customers. We intend to promote our growth by leveraging off the strengths of our existing integrated operations: the depth of our customer relations; our access to market makers, suppliers and government mints and other mints; our trading systems in the U.S. and Europe, are available 24 hours a day 7 days a week; our expansive precious metals dealer network; our depository relationships around the world; our knowledge of secured lending; our logistics capabilities; our trading expertise; and the quality and experience of our management team.\nOur Customers\nOur customers include financial institutions, bullion retailers, industrial manufacturers and fabricators, sovereign mints, refiners, coin and metal dealers, investors and collectors. The Company makes a two way market, which results in many customers also operating as our suppliers. This diverse base of customers purchases a variety of products from the Company in a multitude of grades, primarily in the form of coins and bars.\nFactors Affecting Revenues, Gross Profits, Interest Income and Interest Expense\nRevenues. The Company enters into transactions to sell and deliver gold, silver, platinum and palladium to industrial and commercial users, coin and bullion dealers, mints, and financial institutions. The metals are investment or industrial grade and are sold in a variety of shapes and sizes.\nThe Company also sells precious metals on forward contracts at a fixed price based on current prevailing precious metal spot prices with a certain delivery date in the future (up to six months from date of the forward contract.) Typically, these forward contracts are net settled against our other forward positions or are settled in cash, whereby no physical product is delivered. Sales on forward contracts can be a substantial portion of revenues in any given period. We enter into these forward contacts as part of our hedging strategy to mitigate our price risk of holding inventory; they are not entered into for speculative purposes.\nIn addition, the Company earns revenue by providing storage solutions for precious metals and numismatic coins for financial institutions, dealers, investors and collectors worldwide and by providing storage and order-fulfillment services to our retail customers. These revenue streams are complementary to our trading activity, and represent less than 1% of our revenues.\nThe Company operates in a high volume/low margin industry. Revenues are impacted by three primary factors: product volume, market prices and market volatility. A material change in any one or more of these factors may result in a significant change in the Company's revenues. A significant increase or decrease in revenues can occur simply based on changes in the underlying commodity prices and may not be reflective of an increase or decrease in the volume of products sold.\nGross Profits. Gross profit is the difference between our revenues and the cost of our products. Since we quote prices based on the current commodity market prices for precious metals, we enter into a combination of forward and futures contracts to effect a hedge position equal to the underlying precious metal commodity value, which substantially represents inventory subject to price risk. We enter into these derivative transactions solely for the purpose of hedging our inventory, and not for speculative purposes. Our gross profit includes the gains and losses resulting from these derivative instruments. However, the gains and losses on the derivative instruments are substantially offset by the gains and losses on the corresponding changes in the market value of our precious metals inventory. As a result, our results of operations generally are not materially impacted solely by changes in commodity prices.\nVolatility also affects our gross profits. Greater volatility typically causes the trading spreads to widen resulting in an increase in the gross profit. Product supply constraints during extended periods of higher volatility has historically resulted in a heightening of wider trading spreads resulting in further improvement in the gross profit.\nInterest Income. The Company enters into secured loans and secured financing structures with its customers under which it charges interest. Through its wholly owned subsidiary, CFC, the Company also enters into loans secured by precious metals and numismatic material owned by the borrowers and held by the Company for the term of the loan. The Company offers a number of secured financing options to its customers to finance their precious metals purchases including consignments and other structured inventory finance products whereby the Company earns a fee based on the underlying value of the precious metal.\nInterest Expense. The Company incurs interest expense as a result of usage under its lines of credit and related-party debt. The Company also incurs interest expense as a result of its product financing agreements for the transfer and subsequent re-acquisition of gold and silver at a fixed price with a third-party finance company, and may incur interest expense when we borrow precious metals from our suppliers under short-term arrangements, which can bear interest at a designated rate.\nPerformance Metrics\nIn addition to financial statement indicators, management also utilizes certain key operational metrics to assess the performance of our business.\nWe look at the number of ounces of gold and silver sold and delivered to our customers (excluding ounces recorded on forward contracts). These metrics reflect our business volume without regard to changes in commodity pricing, which also impacts revenue and can mask actual business trends.\nAnother measure of our business volume, unaffected by changes in commodity pricing, is Wholesale Trading & Ancillary Services segment ticket volume and Direct Sales segment ticket volume, which is the total number of orders processed by our trading desks in El Segundo, California and Vienna, Austria. In periods of higher volatility, there is generally increased trading in the commodity markets, and increased demand for our products, which translates into higher business volume. Generally, the ounces sold on a per-trading-ticket basis is substantially higher for orders placed telephonically compared to those placed on our online portal platform.\nInventory turnover is another performance measure on which we are focused. We define inventory turnover as the cost of sales during the relevant period divided by the average inventory during the period. Inventory turnover is a measure of how quickly inventory has moved during the period. A higher inventory turnover ratio, which we typically experience during periods of higher volatility when trading is more robust, reflects a more efficient use of our capital.\nFinally, as a measure of the size of our secured lending segment, we look at the number of outstanding secured loans to customers at the end of the fiscal quarter.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year end is June 30 each year. Unless otherwise stated, references to years in this report relate to fiscal years rather than to calendar years.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview of Results of Operations for the Years Ended June 30,

Overall gross profit decreased due to subdued market conditions (e.g., lower gold and silver sales volume, margins and trading profits ) compared to the prior fiscal year, offset by gross profit of the newly acquired Direct Sales segment (i.e., Goldline).\nThe Company's gross margin percentage decreased by 13.6% to 0.387% from 0.448% in 2017. The drop in gross margin percentage was largely attributable to lower margins resulting from subdued market conditions, higher forward sales, which increase revenues but are associated with negligible gross margin percentages (i.e., near zero) that lowers the overall percentage and lower trading profits, offset by gross margin of the newly acquired Direct Sales segment (i.e., Goldline). The Company enters into forward contracts to hedge its precious metals price risk exposure and not for speculative purposes.\nOur inventory turnover rate for the year ended June 30, 2018 increased by 1.9%, to 26.8 from 26.3 in 2017.

The number of secured loans outstanding increased by 47.7% to 3,507 from 2,375 in 2017.\nThe aggregate increase in interest income also increased due to other finance product income.

The increase was related primarily to a greater usage of our Trading Credit Facility, our new related-party debt financing agreement associated with our acquisition of Goldline, higher LIBOR interest rates that went in to effect subsequent to the Federal Reserve rate increases, and increased third-party loan servicing fees. As compared to the same year-ago period, the following interest expense components increased by (i) $1.8 million or 24.8% related to the Trading Credit Facility (including debt amortization costs), (ii) $0.6 million related to the Goldline Credit Facility, (iii) $0.4 million, or 27.7% related to third-party loan processing fees for acquired secured loans, (iv) $0.3 million related to our liability on borrowed metal balances, and (v) $0.6 million or 40.8% related to product financing agreements with our customers.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>in thousands\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase/(decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase/(decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,721\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.053\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,713\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(99.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur provision for income taxes was $0.0 million and $3.7 million for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our effective tax rate was approximately 0.2% and 34.5% for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our effective tax rate for the year ended June 30, 2018 differs from the federal statutory rate of 28.06% primarily due to the tax impact of a one-time revaluation of net deferred tax assets to reflect their value at the reduced corporate tax rate under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\"). Our effective tax rate for the year ended June 30, 2017 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to favorable tax attributes and deductions resulting from amended state tax filings based on the settlement of the Former parent's tax examination in the years when the Company was included in a consolidated filing. These favorable attributes are allocated to the standalone Company. The change in effective tax rate was also partially due to non-deductible transaction costs in the prior year that become deductible in the current year when the transaction was abandoned.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act\nOn December 22, 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which significantly changed the existing US tax laws, including a reduction in the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result of the enactment of the legislation, the Company incurred a provisional one-time tax expense of $1.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2018, primarily related to the re-measurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company incurred a tax benefit from operations (both recurring and non-recurring) which is largely offset by a one-time revaluation adjustment under TCJA of $1.2 million for year ended June 30, 2018.\nSegment Results of Operations\nThe Company conducts its operations in three reportable segments: (1) Wholesale Trading & Ancillary Services, (2) Secured Lending and (3) Direct Sales.

Liquidity is of critical importance to us and imperative to maintain our operations on a daily basis.\nA substantial portion of our assets are liquid. As of June 30, 2018, approximately 95% of our assets consisted of cash, customer receivables, derivative assets, secured loans receivables, precious metals held under financing arrangements and inventory, measured at fair value. Cash generated from the sales of our precious metals products is our primary source of operating liquidity.\nTypically, the Company acquires its inventory by: (1) purchasing inventory from our suppliers by utilizing our own capital and lines of credit; (2) borrowing precious metals from our suppliers under short-term arrangements which may bear interest at a designated rate, and (3) repurchasing inventory at an agreed-upon price based on the spot price on the specified repurchase date.\nIn addition to selling inventory, the Company generates cash from earning interest income. Through CFC, the Company enters into secured loans and secured financing structures with its customers under which it charges interest. The Company offers a number of secured financing options to its customers to finance their precious metals purchases including consignments and other structured inventory finance products. The loans are secured by precious metals and numismatic material owned by the borrowers and held by the Company as security for the term of the loan. Furthermore, our customers may enter into agreements whereby the customer agrees to repurchase our precious metals at the prevailing spot price for delivery of the product at a specific point in time in the future; interest income is earned from the contract date until the material is delivered and paid for in full.\nWe continually review our overall credit and capital needs to ensure that our capital base, both stockholders' equity and available credit facilities, can appropriately support our anticipated financing needs. The Company also continually monitors its current and forecasted cash requirements, and draws upon and pays down its lines of credit so as to minimize interest expense.\nLines of Credit\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>in thousands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2018 Compared to June 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lines of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>180,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA-Mark has a borrowing facility (\"Trading Credit Facility\") with a syndicate of banks, Co\u00f6peratieve Rabobank U.A. (\"Rabobank\") acting as lead lender and administrative agent for the syndicate. As of June 30, 2018, the Trading Credit Facility provided the Company with access up to $260.0 million, featuring a $210.0 million base, with a $50.0 million accordion option. The Trading Credit Facility is scheduled to mature on March 29, 2019. The Company believes that the Trading Credit Facility provides adequate means to capital for its operations (see Note 14).\nDebt Obligation (Related Party)\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>in thousands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2018 Compared to June 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt Obligation - related party\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company entered into a privately placed credit facility in the amount of $7.5 million (the Goldline Credit Facility\u201d) with various lenders (see Note 14). The outstanding principal and unpaid interest is due upon maturity (August 28, 2020). Borrowings under the Goldline Credit Facility were used to finance a portion of the consideration payable pursuant to the Goldline acquisition (see Note 1).\nLiability on Borrowed Metals\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>in thousands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2018 Compared to June 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liability on borrowed metals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>280,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>274,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe borrow precious metals (usually in the form of pool metals) from our suppliers and customers under short-term arrangements using other precious metal from our inventory as collateral. Amounts under these arrangements require repayment either in the form of precious metals or cash. Liabilities also arise from unallocated metal positions held by customers in our inventory. Typically, these positions are due on demand, in a specified physical form, based on the total ounces of metal held in the position. The $274.7 million increase in the balance of liability on borrowed metals from $5.6 million as of June 30, 2017 to $280.3 million as of June 30, 2018 was due primarily to metals borrowed from a third party to finance repurchase agreements with a related party.\nProduct Financing Arrangements\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>in thousands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2018 Compared to June 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product financing arrangements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>135,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(21,403\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company has agreements with financial institutions and other third parties that allows the Company to transfer its gold and silver inventory to the third party at an agreed-upon price based on the spot price, which provides alternative sources of liquidity. During the term of the agreement both parties intend for inventory to be returned at an agreed-upon price based on the spot price on the termination (repurchase) date. The third parties charge monthly interest as a percentage of the market value of the outstanding obligation; such monthly charges are classified in interest expense. These transactions do not qualify as sales and therefore have been accounted for as financing arrangements and reflected in the consolidated balance sheet as product financing arrangements. The obligation is stated at the amount required to repurchase the outstanding inventory. Both the product financing arrangements and the underlying inventory (which is entirely restricted) are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included as a component of cost of sales.\nSecured Loans Table 59: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>in thousands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2018 Compared to June 30, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Secured loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCFC is a California licensed finance lender that makes and acquires commercial loans secured by bullion and numismatic coins that affords our customers a convenient means of financing their inventory or collections (see Note 5). Predominantly, most of the Company's secured loans are short-term in nature and the renewal of these instruments is at the discretion of the Company and, as such, provides us with some flexibility in regards to our capital deployment strategies.\nDividends\nIn fiscal 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company initiated a cash dividend policy that calls for the payment of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per common share. In fiscal 2016, the Board of Directors modified the policy by increasing the quarterly cash dividend to $0.07 per common share, and in fiscal 2017 the quarterly cash dividend was increased to $0.08 per common share (see Note 16).\nThe Board of Directors determined to suspend the Company's quarterly dividend for both the third and fourth fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018 in order to increase its financial flexibility and strengthen its balance sheet. Going forward, the Board of Directors will re-assess its capital resources and may or may not determine to reinstate the dividend based on that assessment.\nCash Flows\nThe majority of the Company's trading activities involve two day value trades under which payment is received in advance of delivery or product is received in advance of payment. The high volume, rapid rate of inventory turnover, and high average value per trade can cause material changes in the sources of cash used in or provided by operating activities on a daily basis. The Company manages these variances through its liquidity forecasts and counterparty limits by maintaining a liquidity reserve to meet the Company's cash needs. The Company uses various short-term financial instruments to manage the rapid cycle of our trading activities from customer purchase order to cash collections and product delivery, which can cause material changes in the amount of cash used in or provided by financing activities on a daily basis.\nThe following summarizes components of our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>in thousands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2018 Compared to June 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,781\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17,832\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(36,487\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td>"}
