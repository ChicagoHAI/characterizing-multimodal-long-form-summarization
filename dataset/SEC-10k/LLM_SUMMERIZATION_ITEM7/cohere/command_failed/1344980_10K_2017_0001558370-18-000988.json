MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGeneral\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data where you can find more detailed information in \"Note 1. Organization and Presentation\" and \"Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" regarding the basis of presentation supporting the following financial information.\nExecutive Overview\nThe AHGP Partnership\nOur cash flows currently consist of distributions from ARLP on our ARLP partnership interests. We reflect our ownership interest in the ARLP Partnership on a consolidated basis, which means that our financial results are combined with the ARLP Partnership's financial results and the results of our other subsidiaries. The earnings of the ARLP Partnership allocated to its limited partners' interests not owned by us and, prior to the Exchange Transaction, the ARLP Partnership earnings allocated to SGP's general partner interest in the ARLP Partnership and the Intermediate Partnership are reflected as a noncontrolling interest in our consolidated income statement and balance sheet. In addition to the ARLP Partnership, our results of operations include the results of operations of MGP II and MGP, our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries.\nThe AHGP Partnership's results of operations principally reflect the results of operations of the ARLP Partnership adjusted for noncontrolling partners' interest in the ARLP Partnership's net income. Accordingly, the discussion of our financial position and results of operations in this \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" reflects the operating activities and results of operations of the ARLP Partnership.\nOur primary business objective is to increase our cash distributions to our unitholders by actively assisting ARLP in executing its business strategy. ARLP's business strategy is to create sustainable, capital-efficient growth in available cash to maximize its distribution to its unitholders by:\nTable 199: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nexpanding its operations by adding and developing mines and coal reserves in existing, adjacent or neighboring properties;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nextending the lives of its current mining operations through acquisition and development of coal reserves using its existing infrastructure;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 201: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncontinuing to make productivity improvements to remain a low-cost producer in each region in which it operates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nstrengthening its position with existing and future customers by offering a broad range of coal qualities, transportation alternatives and customized services;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 203: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ndeveloping strategic relationships to take advantage of opportunities within the coal industry and MLP sector; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 204: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncontinuing to make accretive investments in oil and gas related activities, such as oil and gas mineral interests and gas compression services in various geographic locations within producing basins in the continental U.S.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe ARLP Partnership\nThe ARLP Partnership is a diversified producer and marketer of coal primarily to major U.S. utilities and industrial users and was the first such producer and marketer in the nation to be a publicly traded master limited partnership. The ARLP Partnership is currently the second-largest coal producer in the eastern U. S. In 2017, the ARLP Partnership produced and sold 37.6 million and 37.8 million tons of coal, respectively. The coal it sold in 2017 was approximately 25.4% low-sulfur coal, 39.9% medium-sulfur coal and 34.7% high-sulfur coal. Based on market expectations, the ARLP Partnership classifies low-sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of less than 1.5%, medium-sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of 1.5% to 3%, and high-sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of greater than 3%. The BTU content of the ARLP Partnership's coal ranges from 11,400 to 13,200.\nThe ARLP Partnership operates eight underground mining complexes in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, and West Virginia, as well as a coal-loading terminal on the Ohio River at Mt. Vernon, Indiana. In addition, the ARLP Partnership owns equity interests in various oil and gas mineral interests and gas compression services in various geographic locations within producing basins in the continental U.S. At December 31, 2017, the ARLP Partnership had approximately 1.67 billion tons of proven and probable coal reserves in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. We believe the ARLP Partnership controls adequate reserves to implement its currently contemplated mining plans. Please see \"Item 1. Business-Mining Operations\" for further discussion of the ARLP Partnership's mines.\nOn July 19, 2017, Alliance Minerals purchased $100 million of Series A-1 Preferred Interests from Kodiak, a privately-held company providing large-scale, high-utilization gas compression assets to customers operating primarily in the Permian Basin. On July 31, 2015, Hamilton acquired the remaining equity interests of White Oak, from White Oak Finance Inc. and other parties. Prior to the acquisition the ARLP Partnership leased coal reserves to White Oak and owned and operated certain surface facilities at White Oak's mining complex. For more information on the White Oak Acquisition, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 3. Acquisitions.\"\nIn 2017, approximately 80.0% of the ARLP Partnership's sales tonnage was purchased by U.S. electric utilities, with the balance sold to third-party resellers and industrial consumers. Although many utility customers recently have appeared to favor a shorter-term contracting strategy, in 2017, approximately 71.7% of the ARLP Partnership's sales tonnage was sold under long-term contracts. The ARLP Partnership's long-term contracts contribute to its stability and profitability by providing greater predictability of sales volumes and sales prices. In 2017, approximately 85.9% of the medium- and high-sulfur coal was sold to utility plants with installed pollution control devices. These devices, also known as scrubbers, eliminate substantially all emissions of sulfur dioxide.\nAs discussed in more detail in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors,\" the ARLP Partnership's results of operations could be impacted by prices for items that are used in coal production such as steel, electricity and other supplies, unforeseen geologic conditions or mining and processing equipment failures and unexpected maintenance problems, and by the availability or reliability of transportation for coal shipments. Moreover, the regulatory environment in which we operate has grown increasingly stringent as a result of legislation and initiatives pursued during the years prior to the current Trump administration. Additionally, the ARLP Partnership's results of operations could be impacted by its ability to obtain and renew permits necessary for its operations, secure or acquire coal reserves, or find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts. As outlined in \"Item 1. Business-Regulation and Laws,\" a variety of measures taken by regulatory agencies in the U.S. and abroad in response to the perceived threat from climate change attributed to GHG emissions could substantially increase compliance costs for the ARLP Partnership and its customers and reduce demand for coal, which could materially and adversely impact its results of operations. For additional information regarding some of the risks and uncertainties that affect the ARLP Partnership's business and the industry in which it operates, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAs discussed above, on February 22, 2018, our Board of Directors and the board of directors of ARLP's general partner approved the Simplification Agreement, pursuant to which we would become a wholly owned subsidiary of ARLP. For more information regarding the Simplification Agreement, please see 'Item 1. Business - Simplification Transactions.'\nThe ARLP Partnership's principal expenses related to the production of coal are labor and benefits, equipment, materials and supplies, maintenance, royalties and excise taxes. The ARLP Partnership employs a totally union-free workforce. Many of the benefits of the ARLP Partnership's union-free workforce are related to higher productivity and are not necessarily reflected in its direct costs. In addition, transportation costs may be substantial and are often the determining factor in a coal consumer's contracting decision.\nThe ARLP Partnership's mining operations are located near many of the major eastern utility generating plants and on major coal hauling railroads in the eastern U.S. The River View and Tunnel Ridge mines and Mt. Vernon transloading facility are located on the Ohio River and the idled Onton mine is located on the Green River in western Kentucky.\nWe have two reportable segments: Illinois Basin and Appalachia and an \"all other\" category referred to as Other and Corporate. Our reportable segments correspond to major coal producing regions in the eastern U.S. Factors similarly affecting financial performance of our operating segments within each of these two reportable segments generally include coal quality, geology, coal marketing opportunities, mining and transportation methods and regulatory issues.\nTable 205: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIllinois Basin reportable segment is comprised of multiple operating segments, including currently operating mining complexes (a) Webster County Coal's Dotiki mining complex, (b) Gibson County Coal's mining complex, which includes the Gibson North and Gibson South mines, (c) Warrior's mining complex, (d) River View's mining complex and (e) the Hamilton mining complex. The Gibson North mine has been idled since the fourth quarter of 2015 in response to market conditions but is expected to resume production in 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Illinois Basin reportable segment also includes White County Coal's Pattiki mining complex, Hopkins County Coal's mining complex, which includes the Elk Creek mine, the Pleasant View surface mineable reserves and the Fies underground project, Sebree's mining complex, which includes the Onton mine, Steamport and certain reserves, CR Services, LLC, CR Machine Shop, LLC, certain properties and equipment of Alliance Resource Properties, ARP Sebree, LLC, ARP Sebree South, LLC, and UC Coal, LLC and its subsidiaries, UC Mining, LLC, and UC Processing, LLC. The Pattiki mine ceased production in December 2016. The Elk Creek mine depleted its reserves in March 2016 and ceased production on April 1, 2016. The ARLP Partnership's Onton mine has been idled since the fourth quarter of 2015 in response to market conditions. UC Coal, LLC equipment assets acquired in 2015 continue to be deployed as needed at various Illinois Basin operating mines.\nTable 206: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAppalachia reportable segment is comprised of multiple operating segments, including the Mettiki mining complex, the Tunnel Ridge mining complex and the MC Mining mining complex.

Investments\" for more information on AROP Funding, Alliance Finance, Alliance Minerals, Cavalier Minerals, the AllDale Partnerships and Kodiak.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nHow the ARLP Partnership Evaluates its Performance\nThe ARLP Partnership's management uses a variety of financial and operational measurements to analyze its performance. Primary measurements include the following: (1) raw and saleable tons produced per unit shift; (2) coal sales price per ton; (3) Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton; (4) EBITDA; and (5) Segment Adjusted EBITDA.\nRaw and Saleable Tons Produced per Unit Shift. The ARLP Partnership reviews raw and saleable tons produced per unit shift as part of its operational analysis to measure the productivity of its operating segments, which is significantly influenced by mining conditions and the efficiency of its preparation plants. A discussion of mining conditions and preparation plant costs are found below under \"-Analysis of Historical Results of Operations\" and therefore provides implicit analysis of raw and saleable tons produced per unit shift.\nCoal Sales Price per Ton. The ARLP Partnership defines coal sales price per ton as total coal sales divided by tons sold. The ARLP Partnership reviews coal sales price per ton to evaluate marketing efforts and for market demand and trend analysis.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per Ton. The ARLP Partnership defines Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton (a non-GAAP financial measure) as the sum of operating expenses, coal purchases and other income divided by total tons sold. The ARLP Partnership reviews Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton for cost trends.\nEBITDA. The ARLP Partnership defines EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) as net income (prior to the allocation of noncontrolling interest) before net interest expense, income taxes and depreciation, depletion and amortization. EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by the ARLP Partnership's management and by external users of its financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others. The ARLP Partnership believes that the presentation of EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding its performance and results of operations because EBITDA, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, (i) provides additional information about our core operating performance and ability to generate and distribute cash flow, (ii) provides investors with the financial analytical framework upon which the ARLP Partnership bases financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions and (iii) presents a measurement that investors, rating agencies and debt holders have indicated is useful in assessing that ARLP Partnership and its results of operations.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA. The ARLP Partnership defines Segment Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) as net income (prior to the allocation of noncontrolling interest) before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, asset impairment, acquisition gain, net, debt extinguishment loss and general and administrative expenses. Management therefore is able to focus solely on the evaluation of segment operating profitability as it relates to our revenues and operating expenses, which are primarily controlled by our segments.\nAnalysis of Historical Results of Operations\n2017 Compared with 2016\nWe reported net income of $302.3 million for 2017 compared to $336.6 million for 2016. The decrease of $34.3 million was due to lower coal sales price realizations offset in part by increased sales volumes, decreased operating expenses, reduced depreciation, depletion and amortization and increased income from the oil and gas investments. Total revenues decreased to $1.80 billion in 2017 compared to $1.93 billion in 2016 as the anticipated reduction in coal sales prices more than offset increased sales volumes and other sales and operating revenues. Even though sales and production volumes increased for 2017, operating expenses were lower compared to 2016, reflecting initiatives to shift production to lower-cost operations. The favorable production cost mix and lower selling expenses in 2017 significantly lowered operating expenses per ton sold compared to 2016. Results presented for 2016 have been recast to reflect a reclassification of depreciation and depletion capitalized into coal inventory as an adjustment to depreciation, depletion and amortization rather than operating expenses.\nTable 208: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(per ton sold)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTons sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n37,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n36,680\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nN/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nN/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTons produced\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n37,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n35,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nN/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nN/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCoal sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,711,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,861,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n45.24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n50.76\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating expenses and outside coal purchases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,095,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,126,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n28.95\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n30.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCoal sales. Coal sales decreased $150.7 million or 8.1% to $1.71 billion for 2017 from $1.86 billion for 2016. The decrease was attributable to lower average coal sales prices, which reduced coal sales by $208.7 million, partially offset by the benefit of increased tons sold, which contributed $58.0 million in additional coal sales. Average coal sales prices decreased $5.52 per ton sold in 2017 to $45.24 compared to $50.76 per ton sold in 2016, primarily due to the expiration of higher-priced legacy contracts, partially offset by higher price realizations at the Mettiki mine from its participation in the metallurgical coal markets in 2017 and improved prices at the MC Mining mine. Sales and production volumes rose to 37.8 million tons sold and 37.6 million tons produced in 2017 compared to 36.7 million\ntons sold and 35.2 million tons produced in 2016, primarily due to strong performances at the Hamilton, Gibson South, Mettiki, MC Mining and Tunnel Ridge mines.\nOperating expenses and outside coal purchases. Operating expenses and outside coal purchases decreased 2.8% to $1.10 billion for 2017 from $1.13 billion for 2016 primarily as a result of the previously discussed favorable production cost mix. On a per ton basis, operating expenses and outside coal purchases decreased 5.7% to $28.95 per ton sold from $30.71 per ton sold in 2016, due primarily to increased sales and production volumes and the previously discussed initiatives to shift production to lower-cost operations. The most significant operating expense variances by category are discussed below:\nTable 209: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLabor and benefit expenses per ton produced, excluding workers' compensation, decreased 13.2% to $9.24 per ton in 2017 from $10.65 per ton in 2016. This decrease of $1.41 per ton was primarily attributable to lower labor and benefit costs per ton due to fewer employees resulting in part from the increased mix of lower-cost production as well as lower health care benefit expenses; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 210: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nProduction taxes and royalty expenses decreased $0.49 per produced ton sold in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily as a result of lower excise taxes per ton resulting from a favorable state production mix, increased export sales and lower average coal sales prices.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating expenses and outside coal purchases per ton decreases discussed above were partially offset by the following increases:\nTable 211: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMaterial and supplies expenses per ton produced increased 1.9% to $9.76 per ton in 2017 from $9.58 per ton in 2016. The increase of $0.18 per ton produced resulted primarily from increases of $0.27 per ton for contract labor used in the mining process and $0.12 per ton for roof support, partially offset by the increased mix of lower-cost production and a related decrease of $0.10 per ton for power and fuel used in the mining process; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMaintenance expenses per ton produced increased 7.7% to $3.34 per ton in 2017 from $3.10 per ton in 2016. The increase of $0.24 per ton produced was primarily due to increased maintenance expenses at several mines in both reportable segments due in part to the use of surplus equipment from the ARLP Partnership's idled mines.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther sales and operating revenues. Other sales and operating revenues were principally comprised of Mt. Vernon transloading revenues, Matrix Design sales and other outside services. Other sales and operating revenues increased to $43.0 million in 2017 from $39.1 million in 2016. The increase of $3.9 million was primarily due to increased mining technology product sales by Matrix Design and increased transloading revenues from Mt. Vernon, partially offset in comparison to 2016 by proceeds of coal supply contract buy-outs received in 2016.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses for 2017 decreased to $63.3 million compared to $75.1 million in 2016. The decrease of $11.8 million was primarily due to lower incentive compensation expenses.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense decreased to $269.0 million for 2017 compared to $336.5 million for 2016 primarily as a result of the depletion of reserves at the Elk Creek mine in the first quarter of 2016, closure of the Pattiki mine in the fourth quarter of 2016, volume reductions at the Dotiki and Warrior mines, the use of surplus equipment from idled mines and ongoing capital reduction initiatives at all of the ARLP Partnerships' operations.\nInterest expense. Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, increased to $39.4 million in 2017 from $30.7 million in 2016 primarily due to interest incurred under the ARLP Senior Notes issued in April 2017, offset in part by reduced borrowings under the ARLP revolving credit facility and the payment of the ARLP Term Loan and ARLP Series B Senior Notes. Interest payable under the ARLP Partnership's Senior Notes, revolving credit facility, Term Loan and Series B Senior Notes is discussed below under \"-Debt Obligations.\"\nEquity investment income. Equity investment income increased to $13.9 million in 2017 from $3.5 million in 2016 due to increased income from the ARLP Partnership's investments in the AllDale Partnerships.\nCost investment income. Distributions of additional preferred interests received from the ARLP Partnership's new Kodiak investment contributed $6.4 million of cost investment income to 2017.\nDebt extinguishment loss. The ARLP Partnership recognized a debt extinguishment loss of $8.1 million in 2017 to reflect a make-whole payment incurred to repay the ARLP Partnership's Series B Senior Notes in May 2017.\nTransportation revenues and expenses. Transportation revenues and expenses were $41.7 million and $30.1 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase of $11.6 million was primarily attributable to increased tonnage for which the ARLP Partnership arranges third-party transportation at certain mines and an increase in average third-party transportation rates in 2017. The cost of third-party transportation services are passed through to the ARLP Partnership's customers.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests. The net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was $116.3 million and $150.6 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is due to an increased percentage allocation of the ARLP Partnership's net income to AHGP due to increased cash distributions to AHGP as a result of the Exchange Transaction in addition to a decrease in the consolidated net income of the ARLP Partnership due to the changes in revenues and expenses described above.\nSegment Information. Our 2017 Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 12.4% to $682.2 million from 2016 Segment Adjusted EBITDA of $778.8 million. Segment Adjusted EBITDA, tons sold, coal sales, other sales and operating revenues and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense by segment are as follows:\nTable 213: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

The decrease of $160.9 million was primarily attributable to lower coal sales, which decreased 17.5% to $1.08 billion in 2017 from $1.31 billion in 2016, partially offset by decreased expenses resulting from a favorable production mix. The coal sales decrease of $228.0 million primarily reflects lower average coal sales prices of $39.90 per ton in\n2017 compared to $48.54 per ton in 2016, primarily resulting from the expiration of higher-priced legacy contracts. Lower sales prices were partially offset by increased tons sold, which increased slightly to 27.0 million tons in 2017 from 26.9 million tons in 2016. Higher sales volumes resulted from strong performances at the Gibson South and Hamilton mines, offset in part by the previously mentioned depletion of reserves at the Elk Creek mine in the 2016 first quarter, the closure of the Pattiki mine in the 2016 fourth quarter and reduced sales at the Dotiki mine. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense decreased 9.6% to $688.5 million in 2017 from $761.6 million in 2016 and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton decreased $2.83 per ton sold to $25.47 compared to $28.30 per ton sold in 2016, primarily due to a significant increase in low-cost longwall production from the Hamilton mine, increased production at the Gibson South operation and a related reduced mix of sales volumes from higher cost mines, as well as reduced selling expenses, lower health care benefit expenses and certain cost decreases described above under \"-Operating expenses and outside coal purchases.\"\nAppalachia - Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 22.3% to $234.1 million for 2017 from $191.5 million in 2016. The increase of $42.6 million was primarily attributable to increased coal sales, which rose 15.2% to $616.3 million in 2017 compared to $534.8 million in 2016, partially offset by higher Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense. The increase of $81.5 million in coal sales resulted from higher sales volumes across the region, which increased 10.8% to 10.8 million tons sold in 2017 compared to 9.7 million tons sold in 2016, and higher average coal sales prices of $57.16 per ton in 2017 compared to $54.94 per ton in 2016. Higher price realizations in 2017 were a result of sales from the ARLP Partnership's Mettiki mine into the metallurgic coal export market and improved prices at the MC Mining mine. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense increased 11.3% to $385.8 million in 2017 from $346.7 million in 2016 due to increased sales volumes. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton increased slightly to $35.78 per ton compared to $35.62 per ton sold in 2016, primarily due to an increased sales mix of higher-cost Mettiki production in 2017 and reduced recoveries from the Tunnel Ridge mine.\nOther and Corporate - Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased by $19.5 million to $65.4 million in 2017 compared to $45.9 million in 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to higher equity investment income from the AllDale Partnerships, distributions of additional preferred interests received from Kodiak and increased mining technology product sales by Matrix Design. In 2017, Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense decreased to $83.5 million for 2017 compared to $89.6 million for 2016 primarily as a result of decreased coal brokerage activity.\nElimination - Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense eliminations decreased in 2017 to $65.6 million from $72.3 million in 2016 and coal sales eliminations decreased to $58.4 million from $65.4 million in 2016, reflecting decreased intercompany coal sales brokerage activity.\n2016 Compared with 2015\nWe reported net income of $336.6 million for 2016 compared to $304.2 million for 2015, an increase of $32.4 million. Comparative results between the years reflect in part the negative net impact in 2015 of $77.6 million of certain large non-cash items (\"Non-Cash Items\") described below and $48.5 million of equity investment loss related to White Oak also in 2015. Net income in 2016 was negatively impacted by reduced revenues compared to 2015 resulting from planned reductions in coal sales and production volumes, lower coal sales prices, lower other sales and operating revenues due to the absence of coal royalty and surface facilities revenues from White Oak in 2016, offset in part by reduced operating expenses in 2016. Lower operating expenses during 2016 primarily reflect decreased sales volumes and a favorable production cost mix resulting from the initiative to shift production to lower-cost per ton operations. Lower volumes in 2016 resulted from idling the Onton and Gibson North mines in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the planned depletion of reserves at the Elk Creek mine in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by additional volumes from the Tunnel Ridge and Gibson South operations and the Hamilton mine acquired in the White Oak Acquisition. The Non-Cash Items in 2015 included asset impairments of $100.1 million offset in part by a net gain of $22.5 million related to final business combination accounting for the White Oak Acquisition.

Coal sales decreased $296.2 million or 13.7% to $1.86 billion for 2016 from $2.16 billion for 2015. The decrease was attributable to a volume variance of $191.2 million resulting from reduced tons sold as discussed above and a price variance of $105.0 million due to lower average coal sales prices. Average coal sales prices decreased $2.86 per ton sold in 2016 to $50.76 compared to $53.62 per ton sold in 2015, primarily due to lower-priced legacy contracts at the Hamilton mine inherited in the White Oak Acquisition and lower average prices at certain mines, particularly at the Gibson South, Dotiki, Tunnel Ridge and MC Mining operations, as a result of challenging market conditions.\nOperating expenses and outside coal purchases. Operating expenses and outside coal purchases decreased 18.8% to $1.13 billion for 2016 from $1.39 billion for 2015 primarily as a result of the previously discussed reductions to coal production volumes and a favorable production cost mix. On a per ton basis, operating expenses and outside coal purchases decreased 10.9% to $30.71 per ton sold from $34.46 per ton sold in 2015, due primarily to the lower-cost production mix and higher productivity from the Tunnel Ridge and Gibson South mines. Operating expenses were impacted by various other factors, the most significant of which are discussed below:\nTable 216: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLabor and benefit expenses per ton produced, excluding workers' compensation, decreased 7.8% to $10.65 per ton in 2016 from $11.55 per ton in 2015. This decrease of $0.90 per ton was primarily attributable to the increased mix of lower-cost production discussed above and reduced overtime in response to market conditions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 217: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMaterial and supplies expenses per ton produced decreased 14.8% to $9.58 per ton in 2016 from $11.25 per ton in 2015. The decrease of $1.67 per ton produced resulted primarily from the increased mix of lower-cost production discussed above and related decreases of $0.77 per ton for roof support, $0.47 per ton for contract labor used in the mining process and $0.24 per ton for certain ventilation expenses partially offset by increases of $0.22 per ton for equipment rentals primarily due to equipment leases assumed in the White Oak Acquisition and $0.15 per ton for environmental and reclamation expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 218: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMaintenance expenses per ton produced decreased 21.1% to $3.10 per ton in 2016 from $3.93 per ton in 2015.

Other sales and operating revenues were principally comprised of Mt. Vernon transloading revenues, Matrix Design sales, other outside services and in 2015, surface facility services and\ncoal royalty revenues received from White Oak prior to the White Oak Acquisition in July 2015. Other sales and operating revenues decreased to $39.1 million in 2016 from $81.7 million in 2015. The decrease of $42.6 million was primarily due to the absence of coal royalty and surface facilities revenues from White Oak in 2016.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses for 2016 increased to $75.1 million compared to $69.1 million in 2015. The increase of $6.0 million was primarily due to higher incentive compensation expenses.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (\"DD&A\") expense for 2016 increased to $336.5 million compared to $324.0 million in 2015. The increase of $12.5 million was primarily due to increases in DD&A associated with the Pattiki mine, which ceased production in December 2016 and the acquisition of the Hamilton mine in July 2015, partially offset by the previously discussed volume reductions at the Onton, Gibson North, and Elk Creek mines. .\nAsset impairment. In 2015, the ARLP Partnership recorded $100.1 million of impairment charges comprised of a $66.9 million impairment related to the idling of the Onton mine, a $19.5 million impairment at the MC Mining complex, primarily due to lower coal sales prices, and a $13.7 million impairment due to the surrender in 2015 of leases of undeveloped coal reserves and related property. No asset impairments were recorded in 2016.\nInterest expense. Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, decreased slightly to $30.7 million in 2016 from $31.2 million in 2015 primarily due to the repayment of the ARLP Series A senior notes in June 2015 offset in part by additional interest incurred under capital lease obligations. Interest payable under the ARLP senior notes, ARLP term loan, ARLP revolving credit facility and capital lease financings is discussed below under \"-Debt Obligations.\"\nEquity investment income (loss). Equity investment income (loss) for 2016 includes Cavalier Minerals' equity method investments in AllDale Minerals. In addition to AllDale Minerals, 2015 also includes the ARLP Partnership's equity method investment in White Oak. For 2016, the ARLP Partnership recognized equity investment income of $3.5 million compared to equity investment loss of $49.0 million for 2015. As discussed above, as a result of the White Oak Acquisition in July 2015, the ARLP Partnership no longer accounts for the Hamilton mine financial results as an equity method investment in its consolidated financials, but now consolidates Hamilton in its financial results. Thus, the change in equity investment income (loss) was primarily due to the elimination of equity losses related to White Oak as well as an increase in equity income from AllDale Minerals.\nAcquisition gain, net. In 2015, the ARLP Partnership recognized a $22.5 million non-cash net gain related to the final business combination accounting for the White Oak Acquisition. For more information on the White Oak Acquisition, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 3. Acquisitions.\"\nTransportation revenues and expenses. Transportation revenues and expenses were $30.1 million and $33.6 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease of $3.5 million was primarily attributable to a decrease in average transportation rates in 2016, partially offset by increased tonnage for which the ARLP Partnership arranges transportation at certain mines. The cost of transportation services are passed through to the ARLP Partnership's customers.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests. The net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was $150.6 million and $92.8 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interest is due to an increase in the consolidated net income of the ARLP Partnership due to the changes in revenues and expenses described above and a greater proportion of the ARLP Partnership's net income being attributed to its limited partner interests rather than our general partner interest reflecting a decrease in ARLP's managing general partner's priority distribution to us resulting from the ARLP Partnership's lower unit distribution rate of $1.75 in 2016 as compared to $2.69 in 2015.\nSegment Information. Our 2016 Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 3.2% to $778.8 million from 2015 Segment Adjusted EBITDA of $804.5 million.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA in 2016 was negatively impacted by reduced revenues compared to 2015 resulting from planned reductions in coal sales and production volumes, lower coal sales prices, lower other sales and operating revenues due to the absence of coal royalty and surface facilities revenues from White\nOak in 2016, offset in part by reduced operating expenses in 2016. Comparative results between the years also reflect the negative impact in 2015 of $48.5 million of equity investment loss related to White Oak prior to the White Oak Acquisition in July 2015. Coal sales decreased 16.9% to $1.31 billion compared to $1.57 billion in 2015. The coal sales decrease of $264.8 million primarily reflects the previously discussed reduction of coal sales and production volumes at the Onton, Gibson North and Elk Creek mines, partially offset by additional volumes from the Gibson South operation and the Hamilton mine acquired in the White Oak Acquisition. Also impacting 2016 were lower average coal sales prices which decreased 4.8% to $48.54 per ton sold compared to $51.01 per ton sold in 2015 as a result of challenging market conditions and lower-priced legacy contracts at the Hamilton mine inherited in the White Oak Acquisition. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense decreased 20.8% to $761.6 million in 2016 from $961.6 million in 2015 due to reduced production and sales volumes as discussed above. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton decreased $2.92 per ton sold to $28.30 in 2016 from $31.22 per ton sold in 2015, primarily as a result of a favorable production cost mix in 2016 due to reducing production from higher-cost per ton operations and improved recoveries at the Gibson South, River View and Warrior mines, as well as certain cost decreases described above under \"-Operating expenses and outside coal purchases.\"\nAppalachia - Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 2.7% to $191.5 million in 2016 from $186.5 million in 2015. The increase of $5.0 million was primarily attributable to increased tons sold and reduced operating expenses partially offset by lower average coal sales prices of $54.94 per ton sold during 2016 compared to $60.76 per ton sold in 2015. Coal sales decreased 6.7% to $534.8 million in 2016 compared to $573.5 million in 2015. The decrease of $38.7 million was primarily due to lower average coal sales prices at the MC Mining and Tunnel Ridge mines. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense decreased 12.9% to $346.7 million in 2016 from $398.1 million in 2015 and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton decreased $6.55 per ton sold to $35.62 compared to $42.17 per ton sold in 2015, primarily due to a favorable production cost mix resulting from an additional 1.0 million tons being produced from Tunnel Ridge in 2016 compared to 2015 and a reduction in volumes from the higher cost Appalachia mines. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton also benefited from fewer longwall move days and lower roof support expenses, lower selling expenses across the region, and certain other cost decreases described above under \"-Operating expenses and outside coal purchases.\"\nOther and Corporate - In 2016, Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $20.1 million compared to 2015 primarily as a result of increased margins on both safety equipment sales by Matrix Design and coal brokerage sales, as well as an increase in equity income from AllDale Minerals and a reduction in workers' compensation and pneumoconiosis accruals related to Pontiki which sold most of its assets in May 2014. In 2016, coal sales decreased $47.3 million and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense decreased $64.1 million compared to 2015. These decreases primarily resulted from reduced intercompany coal brokerage activity.\nElimination - Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense eliminations decreased in 2016 to $72.3 million from $127.2 million in 2015 and coal sales eliminations decreased to $65.4 million from $120.0 million, respectively, primarily reflecting reduced intercompany coal brokerage activity.\nReconciliation of non-GAAP \"Segment Adjusted EBITDA\" to GAAP \"net income\" and reconciliation of non-GAAP \"Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense\" to GAAP \"Operating Expenses\"\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) is defined as net income (prior to the allocation of noncontrolling interest) before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, asset impairment, acquisition gain, net, debt extinguishment loss and general and administrative expenses. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is a key component of consolidated EBITDA, which is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others. We believe that the presentation of EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our performance and results of operations because EBITDA, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, (i) provides additional information about our core operating performance and ability to generate and distribute cash flow, (ii) provides investors with the financial analytical framework upon which we base financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions and (iii) presents a measurement that investors, rating agencies and debt holders have indicated is useful in assessing us and our results of operations.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA is also used as a supplemental financial measure by our management for reasons similar to those stated in the previous explanation of EBITDA. In addition, the exclusion of corporate general and\nadministrative expenses, which are discussed above under \"-Analysis of Historical Results of Operations,\" from consolidated Segment Adjusted EBITDA allows management to focus solely on the evaluation of segment operating profitability as it relates to our revenues and operating expenses, which are primarily controlled by our segments. Results presented for Segment Adjusted EBITDA for 2016 and 2015 have been recast to reflect a reclassification of depreciation and depletion capitalized into coal inventory as adjustments to depreciation, depletion and amortization rather than operating expenses.\nThe following is a reconciliation of consolidated Segment Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most comparable GAAP financial measure:\nTable 223: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nConsolidated Segment Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n682,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n778,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n804,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeneral and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(63,331)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(75,087)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(69,076)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(268,981)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(336,509)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(323,983)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAsset impairment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(100,130)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(39,283)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(30,655)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(29,693)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAcquisition gain, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n22,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDebt extinguishment loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(8,148)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome tax (expense) benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(211)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(14)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(21)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n302,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n336,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n304,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA Expense (a non-GAAP financial measure) includes operating expenses, coal purchases and other income.

For more information on acquisitions, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 3. Acquisitions.\"\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nOur only cash generating assets are limited and general partnership interests in the ARLP Partnership, from which we receive quarterly distributions. We rely on distributions from the ARLP Partnership to fund our cash requirements.\nThe ARLP Partnership has historically satisfied its working capital requirements and funded its capital expenditures, investments and debt service obligations with cash generated from operations, cash provided by the issuance of debt or equity, borrowings under credit and securitization facilities and sale-leaseback transactions. The ARLP Partnership believes that existing cash balances, future cash flows from operations and investments, borrowings under credit facilities and cash provided from the issuance of debt or equity will be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements, capital expenditures and additional investments, debt payments, commitments and distribution payments. Nevertheless, the ARLP Partnership's ability to satisfy its working capital requirements, to fund planned capital expenditures and investments, to service its debt obligations or to pay distributions will depend upon its future operating performance and access to and cost of financing sources, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions generally and in the coal industry specifically, as well as other financial and business factors, some of which are beyond its control. Based on the ARLP Partnership's recent operating results, current cash position, current unitholder distributions, anticipated future cash flows and sources of financing that it expects to have available, the ARLP Partnership does not anticipate any constraints to its liquidity at this time. However, to the extent operating cash flow or access to and cost of financing sources are materially different than expected, future liquidity may be adversely affected. Please see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\"\nThe ARLP Partnership owns equity interests in the AllDale Partnerships for the purchase of oil and gas mineral interests in various geographic locations within producing basins in the continental U.S. and plan to make similar additional equity investments in the future. As of December 31, 2017, the ARLP Partnership had provided funding of $163.4 million to AllDale Partnerships. On July 19, 2017, the ARLP Partnership purchased $100 million of Series A-1 Preferred Interests from Kodiak, a privately-held company providing large-scale, high-utilization gas compression assets to customers operating primarily in the Permian Basin. This structured investment provides the ARLP Partnership with a quarterly cash or payment-in-kind return. In 2018, the ARLP Partnership expects investments of approximately $30.0 million for existing commitments related to the AllDale Partnerships and Kodiak investments. For more information on transactions with the AllDale Partnership, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 10. Variable Interest Entities\" and \"Note 12. Investments.\"\nOn September 22, 2011, the ARLP Partnership entered into a series of transactions with White Oak to support development of the White Oak longwall mining operation (now known as the Hamilton mine) including the purchase of preferred equity interests. On July 31, 2015 (\"White Oak Acquisition Date\"), the ARLP Partnership paid $50.0 million to acquire the remaining equity interest in White Oak and assumed control of the mine. Prior to the White Oak Acquisition Date, the ARLP Partnership had funded $422.6 million to White Oak under various agreements inclusive of the preferred equity interest purchases. In conjunction with the acquisition of White Oak, the ARLP Partnership assumed $93.5 million of debt which was extinguished in the fourth quarter of 2015 and replaced with a $100 million equipment sale-leaseback arrangement. For more information on this sale-leaseback arrangement, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies.\" In 2015, the ARLP Partnership paid $20.5 million to Patriot to acquire various assets, including certain mining equipment and reserves. The ARLP Partnership also paid $5.5 million in 2015 to acquire the remaining equity interest in MAC. For more information on these acquisitions, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 3. Acquisitions.\"\nCash Flows\nCash provided by operating activities was $554.1 million for 2017 compared to $700.7 million for 2016. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in net income adjusted for non-cash items, a large decrease in coal inventories in 2016 compared to a nominal change in 2017 and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets in 2017 compared to a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets in 2016. These decreases were offset in part by a favorable working capital change in accounts payable in 2017 compared to 2016.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $244.8 million for 2017 compared to $191.8 million for 2016. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to the funding of the ARLP Partnership's new cost investment in Kodiak in 2017 and increased capital expenditures for mine infrastructure and equipment at various mines in 2017 compared to 2016. These increases were partially offset by decreased purchases of equity investments and the lack of customer contract buy-outs both in 2017 compared to 2016.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $345.2 million for 2017 compared to $503.1 million for 2016. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to proceeds received from the issuance of the ARLP Senior Notes, as defined below, and decreased payments under the ARLP Term Loan, as defined below. These decreases in cash used were partially offset by repayment of the ARLP Series B Senior Notes, as defined below, increased overall net payments on the securitization and revolving credit facilities, payment of debt issuance and extinguishment costs and no proceeds received from sales-leaseback transactions in 2017.\nThe ARLP Partnership has various commitments primarily related to long-term debt, including capital leases, operating lease commitments related to buildings and equipment, obligations for estimated future asset retirement obligations costs, workers' compensation and pneumoconiosis, capital projects and pension funding. The ARLP Partnership expects to fund these commitments with existing cash balances, future cash flows from operations and investments as well as cash provided from borrowings of debt or issuance of equity.\nThe following table provides details regarding the ARLP Partnership's contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 225: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContractual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthan 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1-3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3-5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMore than\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nObligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nyear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n502,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n72,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n30,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n400,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFuture interest obligations(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n224,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n31,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n62,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n60,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n69,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCapital leases(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n92,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n32,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n57,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPurchase obligations for capital projects\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n64,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n64,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReclamation obligations(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n244,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n238,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWorkers' compensation and pneumoconiosis benefit(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n249,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n206,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,394,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n224,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n147,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n108,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n915,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 226: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nInterest on variable-rate, long-term debt was calculated using rates effective at December 31, 2017 for the remaining term of outstanding borrowings.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 227: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncludes amounts classified as interest and maintenance cost.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 228: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFuture commitments for reclamation obligations, workers' compensation and pneumoconiosis are shown at undiscounted amounts.

These arrangements include coal reserve leases, indemnifications, transportation obligations and financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, such as bank letters of credit and surety bonds. Liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, and we do not expect these off-balance sheet arrangements to have any material adverse effects on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe ARLP Partnership uses a combination of surety bonds and letters of credit to secure its financial obligations for reclamation, workers' compensation and other obligations as follows as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 229: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWorkers'\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nReclamation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCompensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nObligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nObligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSurety bonds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n172.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n84.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n11.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n268.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLetters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures increased to $145.1 million in 2017 compared to $91.1 million in 2016. See our discussion of \"Cash Flows\" above concerning the increase in capital expenditures.\nThe ARLP Partnership currently projects average estimated annual maintenance capital expenditures over the next five years of approximately $4.72 per ton produced. The ARLP Partnership's anticipated total capital expenditures, including maintenance capital expenditures, for 2018 are estimated in a range of $220.0 to $240.0 million. Management anticipates funding 2018 capital requirements with the ARLP Partnership's December 31, 2017 cash and cash equivalents of $6.8 million, cash flows from operations and investments, borrowings under revolving credit and securitization facilities and cash provided from the issuance of debt or equity. The ARLP Partnership will continue to have significant capital requirements over the long-term, which may require it to incur debt or seek additional equity capital. The availability and cost of additional capital to the ARLP Partnership will depend upon prevailing market conditions, the market price of its common units and several other factors over which the ARLP Partnership has limited control, as well as its financial condition and results of operations.\nInsurance\nEffective October 1, 2017, the ARLP Partnership renewed its annual property and casualty insurance program. The ARLP Partnership's property insurance was procured from its wholly owned captive insurance company, Wildcat Insurance. Wildcat Insurance charged certain of the ARLP Partnership's subsidiaries for the premiums on this program and in return purchased reinsurance for the program in the standard market. The maximum limit in the commercial property program is $100.0 million per occurrence, excluding a $1.5 million deductible for property damage, a 75, 90 or 120 day waiting period for underground business interruption depending on the mining complex and an additional $10.0 million overall aggregate deductible. We can make no assurances that the ARLP Partnership will not experience significant insurance claims in the future that could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to purchase property insurance in the future.\nDebt Obligations\nARLP Credit Facility. On January 27, 2017, the Intermediate Partnership entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"ARLP Credit Agreement\") with various financial institutions for a revolving credit facility and term loan (the \"ARLP Credit Facility\"). The ARLP Credit Facility replaced the $250 million term loan (\"ARLP Replaced Term Loan\") and $700 million revolving credit facility (\"ARLP Replaced Revolving Credit Facility\") extended to the Intermediate Partnership on May 23, 2012 (the \"ARLP Replaced Credit Agreement\") by various banks and other lenders that would have expired on May 23, 2017.\nThe ARLP Credit Agreement provided for a $776.5 million revolving credit facility, reducing to $494.75 million on May 23, 2017, including a sublimit of $125 million for the issuance of letters of credit and a sublimit of $15.0 million for swingline borrowings (the \"ARLP Revolving Credit Facility\"), and for a term loan with a remaining principal balance of $50.0 million (the \"ARLP Term Loan\"). The outstanding revolver balance and term loan balance under the ARLP Replaced Credit Agreement were considered advanced under the ARLP Credit Facility on January 27, 2017. On April 3, 2017, the ARLP Partnership entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement (the \"ARLP Amendment\") to (a) extend the termination date of the ARLP Revolving Credit Facility as to $461.25 million of the $494.75 million of commitments to May 23, 2021, (b) eliminate the Cavalier Condition and the Senior Notes Condition (both as defined in the Credit Agreement) and (c) effectuate certain other changes. The ARLP Partnership\nincurred debt issuance costs in 2017 of $9.2 million in connection with the ARLP Credit Agreement. These debt issuance costs are deferred and amortized as a component of interest expense over the term of the ARLP Credit Facility.\nThe ARLP Credit Agreement is guaranteed by all of the material direct and indirect subsidiaries of our Intermediate Partnership, and is secured by substantially all of the Intermediate Partnership's assets. The ARLP Term Loan principal balance of $50.0 million was paid in full in May 2017.\nBorrowings under the ARLP Credit Facility bear interest, at the option of the Intermediate Partnership, at either (i) the Base Rate at the greater of three benchmarks, or (ii) a Eurodollar Rate, plus applicable margins for (i) or (ii), as applicable, that fluctuate depending upon the ratio of Consolidated Debt to Consolidated Cash Flow (each as defined in the ARLP Credit Agreement). The interest rate, with applicable margin, under the ARLP Credit Facility was 4.49% as of December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2017, the ARLP Partnership had $8.1 million of letters of credit outstanding with $456.7 million available for borrowing under the ARLP Revolving Credit Facility. The ARLP Partnership currently incurs an annual commitment fee of 0.35% on the undrawn portion of the ARLP Revolving Credit Facility. The ARLP Partnership utilizes the ARLP Revolving Credit Facility, as appropriate, for working capital requirements, capital expenditures and investments, scheduled debt payments and distribution payments.\nThe ARLP Credit Agreement contains various restrictions affecting the Intermediate Partnership and its subsidiaries including, among other things, incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens, sale of assets, investments, mergers and consolidations and transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to various exceptions, and the payment of cash distributions by the Intermediate Partnership if such payment would result in a certain fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the ARLP Credit Agreement). The ARLP Amendment lowered this fixed charge ratio from less than 1.25 to 1.0 to 1.15 to 1.0 for each rolling four-quarter period and further limited the Intermediate Partnership's ability to incur certain unsecured debt. See \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 10 - Variable Interest Entities\" for further discussion of restrictions on the cash available for distribution. The ARLP Amendment raised the debt to cash flow ratio from 2.25 to 1.0 to 2.50 to 1.0 and also removed the requirement for the Intermediate Partnership to remain in control of a certain amount of mineable coal reserves relative to its annual production. The ARLP Credit Agreement requires the Intermediate Partnership maintain (a) a debt to cash flow ratio of not more than 2.5 to 1.0 and (b) a cash flow to interest expense ratio of not less than 3.0 to 1.0, in each case, during the four most recently ended fiscal quarters. The debt to cash flow ratio and cash flow to interest expense ratio were 0.91 to 1.0 and 16.1 to 1.0, respectively, for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The ARLP Partnership was compliant with the covenants of the ARLP Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2017.\nARLP Series B Senior Notes. On January 27, 2017, the Intermediate Partnership also amended the ARLP 2008 Note Purchase Agreement dated June 26, 2008, for $145.0 million of ARLP Series B Senior Notes which bore interest at 6.72% and were due to mature on June 26, 2018 with interest payable semi-annually (the \"ARLP Series B Senior Notes\"). The amendment provided for certain modifications to the terms and provisions of the ARLP Note Purchase Agreement, including granting liens on substantially all of the Intermediate Partnership's assets to secure its obligations under the ARLP Note Purchase Agreement on an equal basis with the obligations under the ARLP Credit Agreement. The amendment also modified certain covenants to align them with the applicable covenants in the ARLP Credit Agreement. As discussed below, the ARLP Partnership repaid the ARLP Series B Senior Notes in May 2017.\nARLP Senior Notes. On April 24, 2017, the Intermediate Partnership and Alliance Finance (as co-issuer), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Intermediate Partnership, issued an aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million of senior unsecured notes due 2025 (\"ARLP Senior Notes\") in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers. The ARLP Senior Notes have a term of eight years, maturing on May 1, 2025 (the \" ARLP Term\") and accrue interest at an annual rate of 7.5%. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on each May 1 and November 1, commencing on November 1, 2017. The indenture governing the ARLP Senior Notes contains customary terms, events of default and covenants relating to, among other things, the incurrence of debt, the payment of distributions or similar restricted payments, undertaking transactions with affiliates and limitations on asset sales. At any time prior to May 1, 2020, the issuers of the ARLP Senior Notes may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the ARLP Senior Notes with the net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 107.5% of the principal amount redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. The issuers of the ARLP Senior Notes may also redeem all or a part of the notes at any time on or after May 1, 2020, at redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the ARLP Senior Notes. At any time prior to May 1, 2020, the issuers of the ARLP Senior Notes\nmay redeem the ARLP Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the ARLP Senior Notes plus a \"make-whole\" premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. The net proceeds from issuance of the ARLP Senior Notes and cash on hand were used to repay the ARLP Revolving Credit Facility, ARLP Term Loan and ARLP Series B Senior Notes (including a make-whole payment of $8.1 million). The ARLP Partnership incurred discount and debt issuance costs of $7.3 million in connection with issuance of the ARLP Senior Notes. These costs are deferred and are currently being amortized as a component of interest expense over the ARLP Term.\nARLP Accounts Receivable Securitization. On December 5, 2014, certain direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of the Intermediate Partnership entered into a $100.0 million accounts receivable securitization facility (\"ARLP Securitization Facility\"). Under the ARLP Securitization Facility, certain subsidiaries sell trade receivables on an ongoing basis to the Intermediate Partnership, which then sells the trade receivables to AROP Funding, a wholly owned bankruptcy-remote special purpose subsidiary of the Intermediate Partnership, which in turn borrows on a revolving basis up to $100.0 million secured by the trade receivables. After the sale, Alliance Coal, as servicer of the assets, collects the receivables on behalf of AROP Funding. The ARLP Securitization Facility bears interest based on a Eurodollar Rate. In November 2017, the ARLP Partnership extended the term of the ARLP Securitization Facility to January 2018. It was renewed in January 2018 and no matures in January 2019. At December 31, 2017, the ARLP Partnership had $72.4 million outstanding under the ARLP Securitization Facility.\nCavalier Credit Agreement. On October 6, 2015, Cavalier Minerals (see \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and \"Note 10 - Variable Interest Entities\") entered into a credit agreement (the \"Cavalier Credit Agreement\") with Mineral Lending, LLC (\"Mineral Lending\") for a $100.0 million line of credit (the \"Cavalier Credit Facility\"). Mineral Lending is an entity owned by (a) ARH II, (b) an entity owned by an officer of ARH who is also a director of ARH II (\"ARH Officer\") and (c) foundations established by the President and Chief Executive Officer of MGP and Kathleen S. Craft. There is no commitment fee under the facility. Borrowings under the Cavalier Credit Facility bear interest at a one month LIBOR rate plus 6.0% with interest payable quarterly. Repayment of the principal balance begins following the first fiscal quarter after the earlier of the date on which the aggregate amount borrowed exceeds $90.0 million or December 31, 2017, in quarterly payments of an amount equal to the greater of $1.3 million initially, escalated to $2.5 million after two years, or fifty percent of Cavalier Minerals' excess cash flow. The Cavalier Credit Facility matures September 30, 2024, at which time all amounts then outstanding are required to be repaid. To secure payment of the facility, Cavalier Minerals pledged all of its partnership interests, owned or later acquired, in AllDale Minerals. Cavalier Minerals may prepay the Cavalier Credit Facility at any time in whole or in part subject to terms and conditions described in the Cavalier Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2017, Cavalier Minerals had not drawn on the Cavalier Credit Facility. Alliance Minerals has the right to require Cavalier Minerals to draw the full amount available under the Cavalier Credit Facility and distribute the proceeds to the members of Cavalier Minerals, including Alliance Minerals.\nOther. The ARLP Partnership also has an agreement with a bank to provide additional letters of credit in an amount of $5.0 million to maintain surety bonds to secure certain asset retirement obligations and its obligations for workers' compensation benefits. At December 31, 2017, the ARLP Partnership had $5.0 million in letters of credit outstanding under this agreement.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We discuss these estimates and judgments with the audit committee of AGP's Board of Directors (\"Audit Committee\") periodically. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We have provided a description of all significant accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. The following critical accounting policies are materially impacted by judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\nBusiness Combinations and Goodwill\nThe ARLP Partnership accounts for business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. See \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 3. Acquisitions\" for more information on acquisitions. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Given the time it takes to obtain pertinent information to finalize the acquired company's balance sheet, it may be several quarters before the ARLP Partnership is able to finalize those initial fair value estimates. Accordingly, it is not uncommon for the initial estimates to be subsequently revised. The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.\nIn the 2015 acquisitions of White Oak and MAC the ARLP Partnership was required to value the previously held equity interests just prior to acquisition and record a gain or loss if fair value was determined to be different from the carrying value. The ARLP Partnership re-measured its equity investment immediately prior to the White Oak acquisition using a discounted cash flow model which resulted in a loss of $52.3 million. The assumptions used in the determination of the fair value include projected financial information, forward coal price curves and a risk adjusted discount rate. When valuing the previously held equity investment in MAC, a market approach was used to determine that the carrying value of the investment was equal to the fair value resulting in no gain or loss being recorded.\nAn additional part of the White Oak acquisition was valuing the pre-existing relationships that the ARLP Partnership had with White Oak. If pre-existing relationships are settled as part of a business combination the acquirer must evaluate the terms of the relationships compared to current market terms and record a gain or loss to the extent that the relationships are considered above or below market. The ARLP Partnership developed a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of each of these agreements at market rates and compared the valuations to similar models using the contractual rates of the agreements to determine its gains or losses. The assumptions used in these valuation models include processing rates, royalty rates, transportation rates, marketing rates, forward coal price curves, current interest rates, projected financial information and risk-adjusted discount rates. After completing its analysis, the ARLP Partnership recorded a $74.8 million gain as a result of net above-market terms associated with the pre-existing relationships.\nThe only indefinite-lived intangible that the ARLP Partnership has is goodwill. At December 31, 2017, the ARLP Partnership had $136.4 million in goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized, but subject to annual reviews on November 30th for impairment at a reporting unit level. The reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed or operated. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment. The ARLP Partnership has assessed the reporting unit definitions and determined that at December 31, 2017, the Hamilton reporting unit and the MAC reporting unit are the appropriate reporting units for testing goodwill impairment related to the White Oak and MAC acquisitions.\nThe ARLP Partnership computes the fair value of the reporting units primarily using the income approach (discounted cash flow analysis). The computations require management to make significant estimates. Critical estimates are used as part of these evaluations include, among other things, the discount rate applied to future earnings reflecting a weighted average cost of capital rate, and projected coal price assumptions. The ARLP Partnership's estimate of the coal forward sales price curve and future sales volumes are critical assumptions used in its discounted cash flow analysis. There were no impairments of goodwill during 2017 or 2016. In future periods, it is reasonably possible that a variety of circumstances could result in an impairment of its goodwill.\nA discounted cash flow analysis requires the ARLP Partnership to make various judgmental assumptions about sales, operating margins, capital expenditures, working capital and coal sales prices. Assumptions about sales, operating margins, capital expenditures and coal sales prices are based on the ARLP Partnership's budgets, business plans, economic projections and anticipated future cash flows. In determining the fair value of its reporting units, the ARLP Partnership was required to make significant judgments and estimates regarding the impact of anticipated economic factors on its business. The forecast assumptions used in the period ended December 31, 2017 make certain assumptions about future pricing, volumes and expected maintenance capital expenditures. Assumptions are also made for a \"normalized\" perpetual growth rate for periods beyond the long range financial forecast period.\nThe ARLP Partnership's estimates of fair value are sensitive to changes in all of these variables, certain of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside its control. As a result, actual performance in the near- and longer-term could be different from these expectations and assumptions. This could be caused by events such as strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions and the impact of economic factors, such as over production in coal and low prices of natural gas. In addition, some of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value of the reporting units are outside the control of management, including interest rates, cost of capital and the ARLP Partnership's credit ratings. While the ARLP Partnership believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting units and other intangible assets, it is possible a material change could occur.\nCoal Reserve Values\nAll of the reserves presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitute proven and probable reserves. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of reserves, including many factors beyond the ARLP Partnership's control. Estimates of coal reserves necessarily depend upon a number of variables and assumptions, any one of which may vary considerably from actual results. These factors and assumptions relate to:\nTable 230: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ngeological and mining conditions, which may not be fully identified by available exploration data and/or differ from the ARLP Partnership's experiences in areas where it currently mines;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 231: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe percentage of coal in the ground ultimately recoverable;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 232: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nhistorical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 233: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe assumed effects of regulation and taxes by governmental agencies; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 234: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nassumptions concerning future coal prices, operating costs, capital expenditures, severance and excise taxes and development and reclamation costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor these reasons, estimates of the recoverable quantities of coal attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows expected from these properties as prepared by different engineers, or by the same engineers at different times, may vary substantially. Actual production, revenue and expenditures with respect to the ARLP Partnership's reserves will likely vary from estimates, and these variations may be material. Certain account classifications within our financial statements such as depreciation, depletion, and amortization, impairment charges and certain liability calculations such as asset retirement obligations may depend upon estimates of coal reserve quantities and values. Accordingly, when actual coal reserve quantities and values vary significantly from estimates, certain accounting estimates and amounts within our consolidated financial statements may be materially impacted. Coal reserve values are reviewed annually, at a minimum, for consideration in our consolidated financial statements.\nWorkers' Compensation and Pneumoconiosis (Black Lung) Benefits\nThe ARLP Partnership provides income replacement and medical treatment for work-related traumatic injury claims as required by applicable state laws. The ARLP Partnership generally provides for these claims through self-insurance programs. Workers' compensation laws also compensate survivors of workers who suffer employment related deaths. The ARLP Partnership's liability for traumatic injury claims is the estimated present value of current workers' compensation benefits, based on its actuary estimates. The ARLP Partnership's actuarial calculations are based on a blend of actuarial projection methods and numerous assumptions including claim development patterns, mortality, medical costs and interest rates. See \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 17. Accrued Workers' Compensation and Pneumoconiosis Benefits\" for additional discussion. The ARLP Partnership had accrued liabilities for workers' compensation of $54.4 million and $48.1 million for these costs at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. A one-percentage-point reduction in the discount rate would have increased operating expense by approximately $3.6 million at December 31, 2017.\nCoal mining companies are subject to CMHSA, as amended, and various state statutes for the payment of medical and disability benefits to eligible recipients related to coal worker's pneumoconiosis, or black lung. The ARLP Partnership provides for these claims through self-insurance programs. The ARLP Partnership's pneumoconiosis benefits liability is calculated using the service cost method based on the actuarial present value of the estimated pneumoconiosis benefits obligation. The ARLP Partnership's actuarial calculations are based on numerous\nassumptions including disability incidence, medical costs, mortality, death benefits, dependents and discount rates. The ARLP Partnership had accrued liabilities of $74.9 million and $65.0 million for the pneumoconiosis benefits at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. A one-percentage-point reduction in the discount rate would have increased the expense recognized for the year ended December 31, 2017 by approximately $2.8 million. Under the service cost method used to estimate the pneumoconiosis benefits liability, actuarial gains or losses attributable to changes in actuarial assumptions, such as the discount rate, are amortized over the remaining service period of active miners.\nThe discount rate for workers' compensation and pneumoconiosis is derived by applying the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve to the projected liability payout. Other assumptions, such as claim development patterns, mortality, disability incidence and medical costs, are based upon standard actuarial tables adjusted for the ARLP Partnership's actual historical experiences whenever possible. The ARLP Partnership reviews all actuarial assumptions periodically for reasonableness and consistency and update such factors when underlying assumptions, such as discount rates, change or when sustained changes in its historical experiences indicate a shift in its trend assumptions are warranted.\nDefined Benefit Plan\nEligible employees at certain of the ARLP Partnership's mining operations participate in the Alliance Coal, LLC and Affiliates Pension Plan for Coal Employees (the \"Pension Plan\") that it sponsors. The Pension Plan is closed to new participants and effective January 31, 2017 participants within the Pension Plan are no longer receiving benefit accruals for service. All participants can participate in enhanced benefits provisions under the profit sharing and savings plan. The benefit formula for the Pension Plan is a fixed dollar unit based on years of service. The funded status of the pension benefit plan is recognized separately in the consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability. The funded status is the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the plan's benefit obligation. Unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and unrecognized prior service costs and credits are deferred and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until amortized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. Unrecognized actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets are amortized over the participants' average remaining future years of service. The calculation of the ARLP Partnership's net periodic benefit cost (pension expense) and benefit obligation (pension liability) associated with its Pension Plan requires the use of a number of assumptions including expected return on assets, discount rates, mortality assumptions, employee turnover rates and retirement dates. Changes in these assumptions can result in materially different pension expense and pension liability amounts. In addition, actual experiences can differ materially from the assumptions. Significant assumptions used in calculating pension expense and pension liability are shown in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 13. Employee Benefit Plans\" and as follows:\nTable 235: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThe ARLP Partnership's expected long-term rate of return assumption is based on broad equity and bond indices, the investment goals and objectives, the target investment allocation and on the average annual total return for each asset class.

The ARLP Partnership has historically used the average monthly yield for December of an A-rated utility bond index as the primary benchmark for establishing the discount rate.

Long-lived assets and certain intangibles are not reviewed for impairment unless an impairment indicator is noted. Several examples of impairment indicators include:\nTable 240: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nA significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 241: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nA significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used or in its physical condition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 242: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nA significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long-lived asset, including an adverse action of assessment by a regulator;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 243: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAn accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long-lived asset;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 244: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nA current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset; or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 245: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nA current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. The term more likely that not refers to a level of likelihood that is more than 50 percent.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe above factors are not all inclusive, and management must continually evaluate whether other factors are present that would indicate a long-lived asset may be impaired. If there is an indication that carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, the asset is monitored by management where changes to significant assumptions are reviewed. Individual assets are grouped for impairment review purposes based on the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets, generally on a by-mine basis. The amount of impairment is measured by the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset. The fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on various factors, including the present values of expected future cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate, the marketability of coal properties and the estimated fair value of assets that could be sold or used at other operations. The ARLP Partnership recorded an asset impairment of $100.1 million in 2015 (see \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 4. Long-Lived Asset Impairments\"). No impairment charges were recorded in 2017 or 2016.\nEquity Method Investments\nThe ARLP Partnership evaluates equity method investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in management's judgment, that the carrying value of such investments may have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in value. The ARLP Partnership continues to monitor its equity method investments for any indications that the carrying value may have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in value. When evidence of a loss in value has occurred, the ARLP Partnership compares its estimate of the fair value of the investment to the carrying value of the investment to determine whether an impairment has occurred.\nThe ARLP Partnership generally estimates the fair value of its investments using an income approach where significant judgments and assumptions include expected future cash flows and the appropriate discount rate. A discounted cash flow analysis under the income approach requires the ARLP Partnership to make various judgmental assumptions about the investee, such as the investee's sales, operating margins, capital expenditures and expected distributions. Assumptions about sales, operating margins, capital expenditures and expected distributions are based on the investee's business plans, economic projections, and anticipated future cash flows.\nIf the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value and the ARLP Partnership considers the decline in value to be other-than-temporary, the excess of the carrying value over the fair value is recognized in the consolidated financial statements as an impairment charge. Events or changes in circumstances that may be indicative of an other-than-temporary decline in value may include:\nTable 246: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEvidence of the lack of ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 247: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThe inability to sustain an earnings capacity to justify the carrying amount;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 248: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThe current fair value of the investment is less than the carrying amount; or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 249: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOther investors cease to provide support thus reducing their financial commitment to the investee.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2017, the ARLP Partnership determined that no impairment indicators exist for any of its equity method investments.\nMine Development Costs\nMine development costs are capitalized until production, other than production incidental to the mine development process, commences and are amortized on a units of production method based on the estimated proven and probable reserves. Mine development costs represent costs incurred in establishing access to mineral reserves and include costs associated with sinking or driving shafts and underground drifts, permanent excavations, roads and tunnels. The end of the development phase and the beginning of the production phase takes place when construction of the mine for economic extraction is substantially complete. The ARLP Partnership's estimate of when construction of the mine for economic extraction is substantially complete is based upon a number of factors, such as expectations regarding the economic recoverability of reserves, the type of mine under development, and completion of certain mine requirements, such as ventilation. Coal extracted during the development phase is incidental to the mine's production capacity and is not considered to shift the mine into the production phase. At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, there were no capitalized development costs associated with mines in the development phase. All past capitalized development costs are associated with mines that shifted to the production phase and thus, these costs are being amortized. The ARLP Partnership believes that the carrying value of the past development costs will be recovered. At December 31, 2015, capitalized mine development costs representing the carrying value of development costs attributable to properties where the ARLP Partnership had not reached the production stage of mining operations totaled $5.9 million.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nSMCRA and similar state statutes require that mined property be restored in accordance with specified standards and an approved reclamation plan. A liability is recorded for the estimated cost of future mine asset retirement and closing procedures on a present value basis when incurred or acquired and a corresponding amount is capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Those costs relate to permanently sealing portals at underground mines and to reclaiming the final pits and support surface acreage for both the ARLP Partnership's underground mines and past surface mines. Examples of these types of costs, common to both types of mining, include, but are not limited to, removing or covering refuse piles and settling ponds, water treatment obligations, and dismantling preparation plants, other facilities and roadway infrastructure. Accrued liabilities of $130.6 million and $125.7 million for these costs are recorded at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. See \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 16. Asset Retirement Obligations\" for additional information. The liability for asset retirement and closing procedures is sensitive to changes in cost estimates and estimated mine lives. As changes in estimates occur (such as mine plan revisions, changes in estimated costs or changes in timing of the performance of reclamation activities), the revisions to the obligation and asset are recognized at the appropriate credit-adjusted, risk-free interest rate.\nAccounting for asset retirement obligations also requires depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost and accretion of the asset retirement obligation over time. Depreciation is generally determined on a units-of-production basis and accretion is generally recognized over the life of the producing assets.\nOn at least an annual basis, the ARLP Partnership reviews its entire asset retirement obligation liability and make necessary adjustments for permit changes approved by state authorities, changes in the timing of reclamation activities, and revisions to cost estimates and productivity assumptions, to reflect current experience. Adjustments to the liability associated with these assumptions resulted in an increase of $2.2 million and a decrease of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The adjustments to the liability for the year ended December 31, 2017 were primarily attributable to the net impact of overall general changes in inflation and discount rates, current estimates of the costs and scope of remaining reclamation work, reclamation work completed and fluctuations in projected mine life estimates, as well as by increased expansion and disturbances of refuse sites primarily at the Hamilton and River View mines.\nWhile the precise amount of these future costs cannot be determined with certainty, the ARLP Partnership has estimated the costs and timing of future asset retirement obligations escalated for inflation, then discounted and recorded at the present value of those estimates. Discounting resulted in reducing the accrual for asset retirement obligations by $114.0 million and $110.7 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016. The ARLP Partnership estimated that the aggregate undiscounted cost of final mine closure is approximately $244.6 million at December 31, 2017. If the ARLP Partnership's assumptions differ from actual experiences, or if changes in the regulatory environment occur, its actual cash expenditures and costs that it incurs could be materially different than currently estimated.\nContingencies\nWe are not engaged in any material litigation. The ARLP Partnership is currently involved in certain legal proceedings. The ARLP Partnership's estimates of the probable costs and probability of resolution of these claims are based upon a number of assumptions, which it has developed in consultation with legal counsel involved in the defense of these matters and based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Based on known facts and circumstances, the ARLP Partnership believes the ultimate outcome of these outstanding lawsuits, claims and regulatory proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, if the results of these matters were different from management's current opinion and in amounts greater than the ARLP Partnership's accruals, then they could have a material adverse effect.\nRelated-Party Transactions\nSee \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 18. Related-Party Transactions\" for a discussion of the Partnership's related-party transactions.\nAccruals of Other Liabilities\nThe ARLP Partnership had accruals for other liabilities, including current obligations, totaling $287.7 million and $264.2 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These accruals were chiefly comprised of workers' compensation benefits, pneumoconiosis benefits, and costs associated with asset retirement obligations. These obligations are self-insured except for certain excess insurance coverage for workers' compensation. The accruals of these items were based on estimates of future expenditures based on current legislation, related regulations and other developments. Thus, from time to time, the ARLP Partnership's results of operations may be significantly affected by changes to these liabilities. Please see \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 16. Asset Retirement Obligations\" and \"Note 17. Accrued Workers' Compensation and Pneumoconiosis Benefits.\"\nInflation\nAny future inflationary or deflationary pressures could adversely affect the results of the ARLP Partnership's operations. For example, at times the ARLP Partnership's results have been significantly impacted by price increases affecting many of the components of its operating expenses such as fuel, steel, maintenance expense and labor.

    "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGeneral\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data where you can find more detailed information in \"Note 1. Organization and Presentation\" and \"Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" regarding the basis of presentation supporting the following financial information.\nExecutive Overview\nThe AHGP Partnership\nOur cash flows currently consist of distributions from ARLP on our ARLP partnership interests. We reflect our ownership interest in the ARLP Partnership on a consolidated basis, which means that our financial results are combined with the ARLP Partnership's financial results and the results of our other subsidiaries. The earnings of the ARLP Partnership allocated to its limited partners' interests not owned by us and, prior to the Exchange Transaction, the ARLP Partnership earnings allocated to SGP's general partner interest in the ARLP Partnership and the Intermediate Partnership are reflected as a noncontrolling interest in our consolidated income statement and balance sheet. In addition to the ARLP Partnership, our results of operations include the results of operations of MGP II and MGP, our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries.\nThe AHGP Partnership's results of operations principally reflect the results of operations of the ARLP Partnership adjusted for noncontrolling partners' interest in the ARLP Partnership's net income. Accordingly, the discussion of our financial position and results of operations in this \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" reflects the operating activities and results of operations of the ARLP Partnership.\nOur primary business objective is to increase our cash distributions to our unitholders by actively assisting ARLP in executing its business strategy. ARLP's business strategy is to create sustainable, capital-efficient growth in available cash to maximize its distribution to its unitholders by:\n \u00b7 expanding its operations by adding and developing mines and coal reserves in existing, adjacent or neighboring properties; \n \u00b7 extending the lives of its current mining operations through acquisition and development of coal reserves using its existing infrastructure; \n \u00b7 continuing to make productivity improvements to remain a low-cost producer in each region in which it operates; \n \u00b7 strengthening its position with existing and future customers by offering a broad range of coal qualities, transportation alternatives and customized services; \n \u00b7 developing strategic relationships to take advantage of opportunities within the coal industry and MLP sector; and \n \u00b7 continuing to make accretive investments in oil and gas related activities, such as oil and gas mineral interests and gas compression services in various geographic locations within producing basins in the continental U.S. \nThe ARLP Partnership\nThe ARLP Partnership is a diversified producer and marketer of coal primarily to major U.S. utilities and industrial users and was the first such producer and marketer in the nation to be a publicly traded master limited partnership. The ARLP Partnership is currently the second-largest coal producer in the eastern U. S. In 2017, the ARLP Partnership produced and sold 37.6 million and 37.8 million tons of coal, respectively. The coal it sold in 2017 was approximately 25.4% low-sulfur coal, 39.9% medium-sulfur coal and 34.7% high-sulfur coal. Based on market expectations, the ARLP Partnership classifies low-sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of less than 1.5%, medium-sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of 1.5% to 3%, and high-sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of greater than 3%. The BTU content of the ARLP Partnership's coal ranges from 11,400 to 13,200.\nThe ARLP Partnership operates eight underground mining complexes in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, and West Virginia, as well as a coal-loading terminal on the Ohio River at Mt. Vernon, Indiana. In addition, the ARLP Partnership owns equity interests in various oil and gas mineral interests and gas compression services in various geographic locations within producing basins in the continental U.S. At December 31, 2017, the ARLP Partnership had approximately 1.67 billion tons of proven and probable coal reserves in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. We believe the ARLP Partnership controls adequate reserves to implement its currently contemplated mining plans. Please see \"Item 1. Business-Mining Operations\" for further discussion of the ARLP Partnership's mines.\nOn July 19, 2017, Alliance Minerals purchased $100 million of Series A-1 Preferred Interests from Kodiak, a privately-held company providing large-scale, high-utilization gas compression assets to customers operating primarily in the Permian Basin. On July 31, 2015, Hamilton acquired the remaining equity interests of White Oak, from White Oak Finance Inc. and other parties. Prior to the acquisition the ARLP Partnership leased coal reserves to White Oak and owned and operated certain surface facilities at White Oak's mining complex. For more information on the White Oak Acquisition, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 3. Acquisitions.\"\nIn 2017, approximately 80.0% of the ARLP Partnership's sales tonnage was purchased by U.S. electric utilities, with the balance sold to third-party resellers and industrial consumers. Although many utility customers recently have appeared to favor a shorter-term contracting strategy, in 2017, approximately 71.7% of the ARLP Partnership's sales tonnage was sold under long-term contracts. The ARLP Partnership's long-term contracts contribute to its stability and profitability by providing greater predictability of sales volumes and sales prices. In 2017, approximately 85.9% of the medium- and high-sulfur coal was sold to utility plants with installed pollution control devices. These devices, also known as scrubbers, eliminate substantially all emissions of sulfur dioxide.\nAs discussed in more detail in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors,\" the ARLP Partnership's results of operations could be impacted by prices for items that are used in coal production such as steel, electricity and other supplies, unforeseen geologic conditions or mining and processing equipment failures and unexpected maintenance problems, and by the availability or reliability of transportation for coal shipments. Moreover, the regulatory environment in which we operate has grown increasingly stringent as a result of legislation and initiatives pursued during the years prior to the current Trump administration. Additionally, the ARLP Partnership's results of operations could be impacted by its ability to obtain and renew permits necessary for its operations, secure or acquire coal reserves, or find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts. As outlined in \"Item 1. Business-Regulation and Laws,\" a variety of measures taken by regulatory agencies in the U.S. and abroad in response to the perceived threat from climate change attributed to GHG emissions could substantially increase compliance costs for the ARLP Partnership and its customers and reduce demand for coal, which could materially and adversely impact its results of operations. For additional information regarding some of the risks and uncertainties that affect the ARLP Partnership's business and the industry in which it operates, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAs discussed above, on February 22, 2018, our Board of Directors and the board of directors of ARLP's general partner approved the Simplification Agreement, pursuant to which we would become a wholly owned subsidiary of ARLP. For more information regarding the Simplification Agreement, please see 'Item 1. Business - Simplification Transactions.'\nThe ARLP Partnership's principal expenses related to the production of coal are labor and benefits, equipment, materials and supplies, maintenance, royalties and excise taxes. The ARLP Partnership employs a totally union-free workforce. Many of the benefits of the ARLP Partnership's union-free workforce are related to higher productivity and are not necessarily reflected in its direct costs. In addition, transportation costs may be substantial and are often the determining factor in a coal consumer's contracting decision.\nThe ARLP Partnership's mining operations are located near many of the major eastern utility generating plants and on major coal hauling railroads in the eastern U.S. The River View and Tunnel Ridge mines and Mt. Vernon transloading facility are located on the Ohio River and the idled Onton mine is located on the Green River in western Kentucky.\nWe have two reportable segments: Illinois Basin and Appalachia and an \"all other\" category referred to as Other and Corporate. Our reportable segments correspond to major coal producing regions in the eastern U.S. Factors similarly affecting financial performance of our operating segments within each of these two reportable segments generally include coal quality, geology, coal marketing opportunities, mining and transportation methods and regulatory issues.\n \u00b7 Illinois Basin reportable segment is comprised of multiple operating segments, including currently operating mining complexes (a) Webster County Coal's Dotiki mining complex, (b) Gibson County Coal's mining complex, which includes the Gibson North and Gibson South mines, (c) Warrior's mining complex, (d) River View's mining complex and (e) the Hamilton mining complex. The Gibson North mine has been idled since the fourth quarter of 2015 in response to market conditions but is expected to resume production in 2018. \nThe Illinois Basin reportable segment also includes White County Coal's Pattiki mining complex, Hopkins County Coal's mining complex, which includes the Elk Creek mine, the Pleasant View surface mineable reserves and the Fies underground project, Sebree's mining complex, which includes the Onton mine, Steamport and certain reserves, CR Services, LLC, CR Machine Shop, LLC, certain properties and equipment of Alliance Resource Properties, ARP Sebree, LLC, ARP Sebree South, LLC, and UC Coal, LLC and its subsidiaries, UC Mining, LLC, and UC Processing, LLC. The Pattiki mine ceased production in December 2016. The Elk Creek mine depleted its reserves in March 2016 and ceased production on April 1, 2016. The ARLP Partnership's Onton mine has been idled since the fourth quarter of 2015 in response to market conditions. UC Coal, LLC equipment assets acquired in 2015 continue to be deployed as needed at various Illinois Basin operating mines.\n \u00b7 Appalachia reportable segment is comprised of multiple operating segments, including the Mettiki mining complex, the Tunnel Ridge mining complex and the MC Mining mining complex. The Mettiki mining complex includes Mettiki (WV)'s Mountain View mine and Mettiki (MD)'s preparation plant. \n \u00b7 Other and Corporate includes marketing and administrative activities, ASI and its subsidiaries included in the Matrix Group, ASI's ownership of aircraft, the Alliance Partnership's Mt. Vernon dock activities; Alliance Coal's coal brokerage activity, MAC's manufacturing and sales (primarily to the ARLP Partnership's mines) of rock dust, certain of Alliance Resource Properties' land and mineral interest activities, Pontiki Coal, LLC's (\"Pontiki\") legacy workers' compensation and pneumoconiosis liabilities, Wildcat Insurance, which assists the ARLP Partnership with its insurance requirements, Alliance Minerals, and its affiliate, Cavalier Minerals, both of which hold equity investments in various AllDale Partnerships, Alliance Mineral's investment in Kodiak, AROP Funding, LLC (\"AROP Funding\"), and our new subsidiary formed March 30, 2017, Alliance Resource Finance Corporation (\"Alliance Finance\"). Please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 7. Long-Term Debt\", \"-Note 10. Variable Interest Entities\" and \"-Note 12. Investments\" for more information on AROP Funding, Alliance Finance, Alliance Minerals, Cavalier Minerals, the AllDale Partnerships and Kodiak. \nHow the ARLP Partnership Evaluates its Performance\nThe ARLP Partnership's management uses a variety of financial and operational measurements to analyze its performance. Primary measurements include the following: (1) raw and saleable tons produced per unit shift; (2) coal sales price per ton; (3) Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton; (4) EBITDA; and (5) Segment Adjusted EBITDA.\nRaw and Saleable Tons Produced per Unit Shift. The ARLP Partnership reviews raw and saleable tons produced per unit shift as part of its operational analysis to measure the productivity of its operating segments, which is significantly influenced by mining conditions and the efficiency of its preparation plants. A discussion of mining conditions and preparation plant costs are found below under \"-Analysis of Historical Results of Operations\" and therefore provides implicit analysis of raw and saleable tons produced per unit shift.\nCoal Sales Price per Ton. The ARLP Partnership defines coal sales price per ton as total coal sales divided by tons sold. The ARLP Partnership reviews coal sales price per ton to evaluate marketing efforts and for market demand and trend analysis.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per Ton. The ARLP Partnership defines Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton (a non-GAAP financial measure) as the sum of operating expenses, coal purchases and other income divided by total tons sold. The ARLP Partnership reviews Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton for cost trends.\nEBITDA. The ARLP Partnership defines EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) as net income (prior to the allocation of noncontrolling interest) before net interest expense, income taxes and depreciation, depletion and amortization. EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by the ARLP Partnership's management and by external users of its financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others. The ARLP Partnership believes that the presentation of EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding its performance and results of operations because EBITDA, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, (i) provides additional information about our core operating performance and ability to generate and distribute cash flow, (ii) provides investors with the financial analytical framework upon which the ARLP Partnership bases financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions and (iii) presents a measurement that investors, rating agencies and debt holders have indicated is useful in assessing that ARLP Partnership and its results of operations.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA. The ARLP Partnership defines Segment Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) as net income (prior to the allocation of noncontrolling interest) before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, asset impairment, acquisition gain, net, debt extinguishment loss and general and administrative expenses. Management therefore is able to focus solely on the evaluation of segment operating profitability as it relates to our revenues and operating expenses, which are primarily controlled by our segments.\nAnalysis of Historical Results of Operations\n2017 Compared with 2016\nWe reported net income of $302.3 million for 2017 compared to $336.6 million for 2016. The decrease of $34.3 million was due to lower coal sales price realizations offset in part by increased sales volumes, decreased operating expenses, reduced depreciation, depletion and amortization and increased income from the oil and gas investments. Total revenues decreased to $1.80 billion in 2017 compared to $1.93 billion in 2016 as the anticipated reduction in coal sales prices more than offset increased sales volumes and other sales and operating revenues. Even though sales and production volumes increased for 2017, operating expenses were lower compared to 2016, reflecting initiatives to shift production to lower-cost operations. The favorable production cost mix and lower selling expenses in 2017 significantly lowered operating expenses per ton sold compared to 2016. Results presented for 2016 have been recast to reflect a reclassification of depreciation and depletion capitalized into coal inventory as an adjustment to depreciation, depletion and amortization rather than operating expenses.\n\nCoal sales. Coal sales decreased $150.7 million or 8.1% to $1.71 billion for 2017 from $1.86 billion for 2016. The decrease was attributable to lower average coal sales prices, which reduced coal sales by $208.7 million, partially offset by the benefit of increased tons sold, which contributed $58.0 million in additional coal sales. Average coal sales prices decreased $5.52 per ton sold in 2017 to $45.24 compared to $50.76 per ton sold in 2016, primarily due to the expiration of higher-priced legacy contracts, partially offset by higher price realizations at the Mettiki mine from its participation in the metallurgical coal markets in 2017 and improved prices at the MC Mining mine. Sales and production volumes rose to 37.8 million tons sold and 37.6 million tons produced in 2017 compared to 36.7 million\ntons sold and 35.2 million tons produced in 2016, primarily due to strong performances at the Hamilton, Gibson South, Mettiki, MC Mining and Tunnel Ridge mines.\nOperating expenses and outside coal purchases. Operating expenses and outside coal purchases decreased 2.8% to $1.10 billion for 2017 from $1.13 billion for 2016 primarily as a result of the previously discussed favorable production cost mix. On a per ton basis, operating expenses and outside coal purchases decreased 5.7% to $28.95 per ton sold from $30.71 per ton sold in 2016, due primarily to increased sales and production volumes and the previously discussed initiatives to shift production to lower-cost operations. The most significant operating expense variances by category are discussed below:\n \u00b7 Labor and benefit expenses per ton produced, excluding workers' compensation, decreased 13.2% to $9.24 per ton in 2017 from $10.65 per ton in 2016. This decrease of $1.41 per ton was primarily attributable to lower labor and benefit costs per ton due to fewer employees resulting in part from the increased mix of lower-cost production as well as lower health care benefit expenses; and \n \u00b7 Production taxes and royalty expenses decreased $0.49 per produced ton sold in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily as a result of lower excise taxes per ton resulting from a favorable state production mix, increased export sales and lower average coal sales prices. \nOperating expenses and outside coal purchases per ton decreases discussed above were partially offset by the following increases:\n \u00b7 Material and supplies expenses per ton produced increased 1.9% to $9.76 per ton in 2017 from $9.58 per ton in 2016. The increase of $0.18 per ton produced resulted primarily from increases of $0.27 per ton for contract labor used in the mining process and $0.12 per ton for roof support, partially offset by the increased mix of lower-cost production and a related decrease of $0.10 per ton for power and fuel used in the mining process; and \n \u00b7 Maintenance expenses per ton produced increased 7.7% to $3.34 per ton in 2017 from $3.10 per ton in 2016. The increase of $0.24 per ton produced was primarily due to increased maintenance expenses at several mines in both reportable segments due in part to the use of surplus equipment from the ARLP Partnership's idled mines. \nOther sales and operating revenues. Other sales and operating revenues were principally comprised of Mt. Vernon transloading revenues, Matrix Design sales and other outside services. Other sales and operating revenues increased to $43.0 million in 2017 from $39.1 million in 2016. The increase of $3.9 million was primarily due to increased mining technology product sales by Matrix Design and increased transloading revenues from Mt. Vernon, partially offset in comparison to 2016 by proceeds of coal supply contract buy-outs received in 2016.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses for 2017 decreased to $63.3 million compared to $75.1 million in 2016. The decrease of $11.8 million was primarily due to lower incentive compensation expenses.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense decreased to $269.0 million for 2017 compared to $336.5 million for 2016 primarily as a result of the depletion of reserves at the Elk Creek mine in the first quarter of 2016, closure of the Pattiki mine in the fourth quarter of 2016, volume reductions at the Dotiki and Warrior mines, the use of surplus equipment from idled mines and ongoing capital reduction initiatives at all of the ARLP Partnerships' operations.\nInterest expense. Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, increased to $39.4 million in 2017 from $30.7 million in 2016 primarily due to interest incurred under the ARLP Senior Notes issued in April 2017, offset in part by reduced borrowings under the ARLP revolving credit facility and the payment of the ARLP Term Loan and ARLP Series B Senior Notes. Interest payable under the ARLP Partnership's Senior Notes, revolving credit facility, Term Loan and Series B Senior Notes is discussed below under \"-Debt Obligations.\"\nEquity investment income. Equity investment income increased to $13.9 million in 2017 from $3.5 million in 2016 due to increased income from the ARLP Partnership's investments in the AllDale Partnerships.\nCost investment income. Distributions of additional preferred interests received from the ARLP Partnership's new Kodiak investment contributed $6.4 million of cost investment income to 2017.\nDebt extinguishment loss. The ARLP Partnership recognized a debt extinguishment loss of $8.1 million in 2017 to reflect a make-whole payment incurred to repay the ARLP Partnership's Series B Senior Notes in May 2017.\nTransportation revenues and expenses. Transportation revenues and expenses were $41.7 million and $30.1 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase of $11.6 million was primarily attributable to increased tonnage for which the ARLP Partnership arranges third-party transportation at certain mines and an increase in average third-party transportation rates in 2017. The cost of third-party transportation services are passed through to the ARLP Partnership's customers.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests. The net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was $116.3 million and $150.6 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is due to an increased percentage allocation of the ARLP Partnership's net income to AHGP due to increased cash distributions to AHGP as a result of the Exchange Transaction in addition to a decrease in the consolidated net income of the ARLP Partnership due to the changes in revenues and expenses described above.\nSegment Information. Our 2017 Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 12.4% to $682.2 million from 2016 Segment Adjusted EBITDA of $778.8 million. Segment Adjusted EBITDA, tons sold, coal sales, other sales and operating revenues and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense by segment are as follows:\n\n (1) For a definition of Segment Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense and related reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures, please see below under \"-Reconciliation of non-GAAP \"Segment Adjusted EBITDA\" to GAAP \"net income\" and reconciliation of non-GAAP \"Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense\" to GAAP \"Operating Expenses.\" Results presented for Segment Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense for 2016 have been recast to reflect a reclassification of depreciation and depletion capitalized into coal inventory as adjustments to depreciation, depletion and amortization rather than operating expenses. \nIllinois Basin - Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 29.1% to $391.4 million in 2017 from $552.3 million in 2016. The decrease of $160.9 million was primarily attributable to lower coal sales, which decreased 17.5% to $1.08 billion in 2017 from $1.31 billion in 2016, partially offset by decreased expenses resulting from a favorable production mix. The coal sales decrease of $228.0 million primarily reflects lower average coal sales prices of $39.90 per ton in\n2017 compared to $48.54 per ton in 2016, primarily resulting from the expiration of higher-priced legacy contracts. Lower sales prices were partially offset by increased tons sold, which increased slightly to 27.0 million tons in 2017 from 26.9 million tons in 2016. Higher sales volumes resulted from strong performances at the Gibson South and Hamilton mines, offset in part by the previously mentioned depletion of reserves at the Elk Creek mine in the 2016 first quarter, the closure of the Pattiki mine in the 2016 fourth quarter and reduced sales at the Dotiki mine. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense decreased 9.6% to $688.5 million in 2017 from $761.6 million in 2016 and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton decreased $2.83 per ton sold to $25.47 compared to $28.30 per ton sold in 2016, primarily due to a significant increase in low-cost longwall production from the Hamilton mine, increased production at the Gibson South operation and a related reduced mix of sales volumes from higher cost mines, as well as reduced selling expenses, lower health care benefit expenses and certain cost decreases described above under \"-Operating expenses and outside coal purchases.\"\nAppalachia - Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 22.3% to $234.1 million for 2017 from $191.5 million in 2016. The increase of $42.6 million was primarily attributable to increased coal sales, which rose 15.2% to $616.3 million in 2017 compared to $534.8 million in 2016, partially offset by higher Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense. The increase of $81.5 million in coal sales resulted from higher sales volumes across the region, which increased 10.8% to 10.8 million tons sold in 2017 compared to 9.7 million tons sold in 2016, and higher average coal sales prices of $57.16 per ton in 2017 compared to $54.94 per ton in 2016. Higher price realizations in 2017 were a result of sales from the ARLP Partnership's Mettiki mine into the metallurgic coal export market and improved prices at the MC Mining mine. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense increased 11.3% to $385.8 million in 2017 from $346.7 million in 2016 due to increased sales volumes. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton increased slightly to $35.78 per ton compared to $35.62 per ton sold in 2016, primarily due to an increased sales mix of higher-cost Mettiki production in 2017 and reduced recoveries from the Tunnel Ridge mine.\nOther and Corporate - Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased by $19.5 million to $65.4 million in 2017 compared to $45.9 million in 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to higher equity investment income from the AllDale Partnerships, distributions of additional preferred interests received from Kodiak and increased mining technology product sales by Matrix Design. In 2017, Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense decreased to $83.5 million for 2017 compared to $89.6 million for 2016 primarily as a result of decreased coal brokerage activity.\nElimination - Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense eliminations decreased in 2017 to $65.6 million from $72.3 million in 2016 and coal sales eliminations decreased to $58.4 million from $65.4 million in 2016, reflecting decreased intercompany coal sales brokerage activity.\n2016 Compared with 2015\nWe reported net income of $336.6 million for 2016 compared to $304.2 million for 2015, an increase of $32.4 million. Comparative results between the years reflect in part the negative net impact in 2015 of $77.6 million of certain large non-cash items (\"Non-Cash Items\") described below and $48.5 million of equity investment loss related to White Oak also in 2015. Net income in 2016 was negatively impacted by reduced revenues compared to 2015 resulting from planned reductions in coal sales and production volumes, lower coal sales prices, lower other sales and operating revenues due to the absence of coal royalty and surface facilities revenues from White Oak in 2016, offset in part by reduced operating expenses in 2016. Lower operating expenses during 2016 primarily reflect decreased sales volumes and a favorable production cost mix resulting from the initiative to shift production to lower-cost per ton operations. Lower volumes in 2016 resulted from idling the Onton and Gibson North mines in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the planned depletion of reserves at the Elk Creek mine in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by additional volumes from the Tunnel Ridge and Gibson South operations and the Hamilton mine acquired in the White Oak Acquisition. The Non-Cash Items in 2015 included asset impairments of $100.1 million offset in part by a net gain of $22.5 million related to final business combination accounting for the White Oak Acquisition. For more information on the White Oak Acquisition, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 3. Acquisitions.\" For more information on the 2015 non-cash asset impairments, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 4. Long-Lived Asset Impairments.\" Results presented for 2016 and 2015\nhave been recast to reflect a reclassification of depreciation and depletion capitalized into coal inventory as an adjustment to depreciation, depletion and amortization rather than operating expenses.\n\nCoal sales. Coal sales decreased $296.2 million or 13.7% to $1.86 billion for 2016 from $2.16 billion for 2015. The decrease was attributable to a volume variance of $191.2 million resulting from reduced tons sold as discussed above and a price variance of $105.0 million due to lower average coal sales prices. Average coal sales prices decreased $2.86 per ton sold in 2016 to $50.76 compared to $53.62 per ton sold in 2015, primarily due to lower-priced legacy contracts at the Hamilton mine inherited in the White Oak Acquisition and lower average prices at certain mines, particularly at the Gibson South, Dotiki, Tunnel Ridge and MC Mining operations, as a result of challenging market conditions.\nOperating expenses and outside coal purchases. Operating expenses and outside coal purchases decreased 18.8% to $1.13 billion for 2016 from $1.39 billion for 2015 primarily as a result of the previously discussed reductions to coal production volumes and a favorable production cost mix. On a per ton basis, operating expenses and outside coal purchases decreased 10.9% to $30.71 per ton sold from $34.46 per ton sold in 2015, due primarily to the lower-cost production mix and higher productivity from the Tunnel Ridge and Gibson South mines. Operating expenses were impacted by various other factors, the most significant of which are discussed below:\n \u00b7 Labor and benefit expenses per ton produced, excluding workers' compensation, decreased 7.8% to $10.65 per ton in 2016 from $11.55 per ton in 2015. This decrease of $0.90 per ton was primarily attributable to the increased mix of lower-cost production discussed above and reduced overtime in response to market conditions; \n \u00b7 Material and supplies expenses per ton produced decreased 14.8% to $9.58 per ton in 2016 from $11.25 per ton in 2015. The decrease of $1.67 per ton produced resulted primarily from the increased mix of lower-cost production discussed above and related decreases of $0.77 per ton for roof support, $0.47 per ton for contract labor used in the mining process and $0.24 per ton for certain ventilation expenses partially offset by increases of $0.22 per ton for equipment rentals primarily due to equipment leases assumed in the White Oak Acquisition and $0.15 per ton for environmental and reclamation expenses; \n \u00b7 Maintenance expenses per ton produced decreased 21.1% to $3.10 per ton in 2016 from $3.93 per ton in 2015. The decrease of $0.83 per ton produced was primarily due to production variances at certain mines discussed above; and \n \u00b7 Production taxes and royalties expenses incurred as a percentage of coal sales prices and volumes decreased $0.39 per produced ton sold in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily as a result of lower excise taxes per ton resulting from a favorable state production mix and lower average coal sales prices discussed above; \nOperating expenses and outside coal purchases per ton decreases discussed above were partially offset by the following increase:\n \u00b7 Operating expenses were increased by a 1.4 million ton inventory reduction and related inventory cost adjustments in 2016 as compared to a 1.0 million ton inventory increase and related inventory cost adjustments in 2015. \nOther sales and operating revenues. Other sales and operating revenues were principally comprised of Mt. Vernon transloading revenues, Matrix Design sales, other outside services and in 2015, surface facility services and\ncoal royalty revenues received from White Oak prior to the White Oak Acquisition in July 2015. Other sales and operating revenues decreased to $39.1 million in 2016 from $81.7 million in 2015. The decrease of $42.6 million was primarily due to the absence of coal royalty and surface facilities revenues from White Oak in 2016.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses for 2016 increased to $75.1 million compared to $69.1 million in 2015. The increase of $6.0 million was primarily due to higher incentive compensation expenses.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (\"DD&A\") expense for 2016 increased to $336.5 million compared to $324.0 million in 2015. The increase of $12.5 million was primarily due to increases in DD&A associated with the Pattiki mine, which ceased production in December 2016 and the acquisition of the Hamilton mine in July 2015, partially offset by the previously discussed volume reductions at the Onton, Gibson North, and Elk Creek mines. .\nAsset impairment. In 2015, the ARLP Partnership recorded $100.1 million of impairment charges comprised of a $66.9 million impairment related to the idling of the Onton mine, a $19.5 million impairment at the MC Mining complex, primarily due to lower coal sales prices, and a $13.7 million impairment due to the surrender in 2015 of leases of undeveloped coal reserves and related property. No asset impairments were recorded in 2016.\nInterest expense. Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, decreased slightly to $30.7 million in 2016 from $31.2 million in 2015 primarily due to the repayment of the ARLP Series A senior notes in June 2015 offset in part by additional interest incurred under capital lease obligations. Interest payable under the ARLP senior notes, ARLP term loan, ARLP revolving credit facility and capital lease financings is discussed below under \"-Debt Obligations.\"\nEquity investment income (loss). Equity investment income (loss) for 2016 includes Cavalier Minerals' equity method investments in AllDale Minerals. In addition to AllDale Minerals, 2015 also includes the ARLP Partnership's equity method investment in White Oak. For 2016, the ARLP Partnership recognized equity investment income of $3.5 million compared to equity investment loss of $49.0 million for 2015. As discussed above, as a result of the White Oak Acquisition in July 2015, the ARLP Partnership no longer accounts for the Hamilton mine financial results as an equity method investment in its consolidated financials, but now consolidates Hamilton in its financial results. Thus, the change in equity investment income (loss) was primarily due to the elimination of equity losses related to White Oak as well as an increase in equity income from AllDale Minerals.\nAcquisition gain, net. In 2015, the ARLP Partnership recognized a $22.5 million non-cash net gain related to the final business combination accounting for the White Oak Acquisition. For more information on the White Oak Acquisition, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 3. Acquisitions.\"\nTransportation revenues and expenses. Transportation revenues and expenses were $30.1 million and $33.6 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease of $3.5 million was primarily attributable to a decrease in average transportation rates in 2016, partially offset by increased tonnage for which the ARLP Partnership arranges transportation at certain mines. The cost of transportation services are passed through to the ARLP Partnership's customers.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests. The net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was $150.6 million and $92.8 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interest is due to an increase in the consolidated net income of the ARLP Partnership due to the changes in revenues and expenses described above and a greater proportion of the ARLP Partnership's net income being attributed to its limited partner interests rather than our general partner interest reflecting a decrease in ARLP's managing general partner's priority distribution to us resulting from the ARLP Partnership's lower unit distribution rate of $1.75 in 2016 as compared to $2.69 in 2015.\nSegment Information. Our 2016 Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 3.2% to $778.8 million from 2015 Segment Adjusted EBITDA of $804.5 million. Segment Adjusted EBITDA, tons sold, coal sales, other sales and operating revenues and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense by segment are as follows:\n\n (1) For a definition of Segment Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense and related reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures, please see below under \"-Reconciliation of non-GAAP \"Segment Adjusted EBITDA\" to GAAP \"net income\" and reconciliation of non-GAAP \"Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense\" to GAAP \"Operating Expenses.\" Results presented for Segment Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense for 2016 and 2015 have been recast to reflect a reclassification of depreciation and depletion capitalized into coal inventory as adjustments to depreciation, depletion and amortization rather than operating expenses. \nIllinois Basin - Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 8.7% to $552.3 million in 2016 from $604.8 million in 2015, a decrease of $52.5 million. Segment Adjusted EBITDA in 2016 was negatively impacted by reduced revenues compared to 2015 resulting from planned reductions in coal sales and production volumes, lower coal sales prices, lower other sales and operating revenues due to the absence of coal royalty and surface facilities revenues from White\nOak in 2016, offset in part by reduced operating expenses in 2016. Comparative results between the years also reflect the negative impact in 2015 of $48.5 million of equity investment loss related to White Oak prior to the White Oak Acquisition in July 2015. Coal sales decreased 16.9% to $1.31 billion compared to $1.57 billion in 2015. The coal sales decrease of $264.8 million primarily reflects the previously discussed reduction of coal sales and production volumes at the Onton, Gibson North and Elk Creek mines, partially offset by additional volumes from the Gibson South operation and the Hamilton mine acquired in the White Oak Acquisition. Also impacting 2016 were lower average coal sales prices which decreased 4.8% to $48.54 per ton sold compared to $51.01 per ton sold in 2015 as a result of challenging market conditions and lower-priced legacy contracts at the Hamilton mine inherited in the White Oak Acquisition. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense decreased 20.8% to $761.6 million in 2016 from $961.6 million in 2015 due to reduced production and sales volumes as discussed above. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton decreased $2.92 per ton sold to $28.30 in 2016 from $31.22 per ton sold in 2015, primarily as a result of a favorable production cost mix in 2016 due to reducing production from higher-cost per ton operations and improved recoveries at the Gibson South, River View and Warrior mines, as well as certain cost decreases described above under \"-Operating expenses and outside coal purchases.\"\nAppalachia - Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 2.7% to $191.5 million in 2016 from $186.5 million in 2015. The increase of $5.0 million was primarily attributable to increased tons sold and reduced operating expenses partially offset by lower average coal sales prices of $54.94 per ton sold during 2016 compared to $60.76 per ton sold in 2015. Coal sales decreased 6.7% to $534.8 million in 2016 compared to $573.5 million in 2015. The decrease of $38.7 million was primarily due to lower average coal sales prices at the MC Mining and Tunnel Ridge mines. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense decreased 12.9% to $346.7 million in 2016 from $398.1 million in 2015 and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton decreased $6.55 per ton sold to $35.62 compared to $42.17 per ton sold in 2015, primarily due to a favorable production cost mix resulting from an additional 1.0 million tons being produced from Tunnel Ridge in 2016 compared to 2015 and a reduction in volumes from the higher cost Appalachia mines. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton also benefited from fewer longwall move days and lower roof support expenses, lower selling expenses across the region, and certain other cost decreases described above under \"-Operating expenses and outside coal purchases.\"\nOther and Corporate - In 2016, Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $20.1 million compared to 2015 primarily as a result of increased margins on both safety equipment sales by Matrix Design and coal brokerage sales, as well as an increase in equity income from AllDale Minerals and a reduction in workers' compensation and pneumoconiosis accruals related to Pontiki which sold most of its assets in May 2014. In 2016, coal sales decreased $47.3 million and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense decreased $64.1 million compared to 2015. These decreases primarily resulted from reduced intercompany coal brokerage activity.\nElimination - Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense eliminations decreased in 2016 to $72.3 million from $127.2 million in 2015 and coal sales eliminations decreased to $65.4 million from $120.0 million, respectively, primarily reflecting reduced intercompany coal brokerage activity.\nReconciliation of non-GAAP \"Segment Adjusted EBITDA\" to GAAP \"net income\" and reconciliation of non-GAAP \"Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense\" to GAAP \"Operating Expenses\"\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) is defined as net income (prior to the allocation of noncontrolling interest) before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, asset impairment, acquisition gain, net, debt extinguishment loss and general and administrative expenses. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is a key component of consolidated EBITDA, which is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others. We believe that the presentation of EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our performance and results of operations because EBITDA, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, (i) provides additional information about our core operating performance and ability to generate and distribute cash flow, (ii) provides investors with the financial analytical framework upon which we base financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions and (iii) presents a measurement that investors, rating agencies and debt holders have indicated is useful in assessing us and our results of operations.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA is also used as a supplemental financial measure by our management for reasons similar to those stated in the previous explanation of EBITDA. In addition, the exclusion of corporate general and\nadministrative expenses, which are discussed above under \"-Analysis of Historical Results of Operations,\" from consolidated Segment Adjusted EBITDA allows management to focus solely on the evaluation of segment operating profitability as it relates to our revenues and operating expenses, which are primarily controlled by our segments. Results presented for Segment Adjusted EBITDA for 2016 and 2015 have been recast to reflect a reclassification of depreciation and depletion capitalized into coal inventory as adjustments to depreciation, depletion and amortization rather than operating expenses.\nThe following is a reconciliation of consolidated Segment Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most comparable GAAP financial measure:\n\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA Expense (a non-GAAP financial measure) includes operating expenses, coal purchases and other income. Transportation expenses are excluded as these expenses are passed through to the ARLP Partnership's customers and, consequently, it does not realize any gain or loss on transportation revenues. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense is used as a supplemental financial measure by the ARLP Partnership's management to assess the operating performance of the segments. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense is a key component of Segment Adjusted EBITDA in addition to coal sales and other sales and operating revenues. The exclusion of corporate general and administrative expenses from Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense allows management to focus solely on the evaluation of segment operating performance as it primarily relates to operating expenses. Results presented for Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense for 2016 and 2015 have been recast to reflect a reclassification of depreciation and depletion capitalized into coal inventory as adjustments to depreciation, depletion and amortization rather than operating expenses\nThe following is a reconciliation of consolidated Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense to operating expense, the most comparable GAAP financial measure:\n\nOngoing Acquisition Activities\nConsistent with its business strategy, from time to time the ARLP Partnership engages in discussions with potential sellers regarding possible acquisitions of certain assets and/or companies of the sellers. For more information on acquisitions, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 3. Acquisitions.\"\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nOur only cash generating assets are limited and general partnership interests in the ARLP Partnership, from which we receive quarterly distributions. We rely on distributions from the ARLP Partnership to fund our cash requirements.\nThe ARLP Partnership has historically satisfied its working capital requirements and funded its capital expenditures, investments and debt service obligations with cash generated from operations, cash provided by the issuance of debt or equity, borrowings under credit and securitization facilities and sale-leaseback transactions. The ARLP Partnership believes that existing cash balances, future cash flows from operations and investments, borrowings under credit facilities and cash provided from the issuance of debt or equity will be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements, capital expenditures and additional investments, debt payments, commitments and distribution payments. Nevertheless, the ARLP Partnership's ability to satisfy its working capital requirements, to fund planned capital expenditures and investments, to service its debt obligations or to pay distributions will depend upon its future operating performance and access to and cost of financing sources, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions generally and in the coal industry specifically, as well as other financial and business factors, some of which are beyond its control. Based on the ARLP Partnership's recent operating results, current cash position, current unitholder distributions, anticipated future cash flows and sources of financing that it expects to have available, the ARLP Partnership does not anticipate any constraints to its liquidity at this time. However, to the extent operating cash flow or access to and cost of financing sources are materially different than expected, future liquidity may be adversely affected. Please see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\"\nThe ARLP Partnership owns equity interests in the AllDale Partnerships for the purchase of oil and gas mineral interests in various geographic locations within producing basins in the continental U.S. and plan to make similar additional equity investments in the future. As of December 31, 2017, the ARLP Partnership had provided funding of $163.4 million to AllDale Partnerships. On July 19, 2017, the ARLP Partnership purchased $100 million of Series A-1 Preferred Interests from Kodiak, a privately-held company providing large-scale, high-utilization gas compression assets to customers operating primarily in the Permian Basin. This structured investment provides the ARLP Partnership with a quarterly cash or payment-in-kind return. In 2018, the ARLP Partnership expects investments of approximately $30.0 million for existing commitments related to the AllDale Partnerships and Kodiak investments. For more information on transactions with the AllDale Partnership, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 10. Variable Interest Entities\" and \"Note 12. Investments.\"\nOn September 22, 2011, the ARLP Partnership entered into a series of transactions with White Oak to support development of the White Oak longwall mining operation (now known as the Hamilton mine) including the purchase of preferred equity interests. On July 31, 2015 (\"White Oak Acquisition Date\"), the ARLP Partnership paid $50.0 million to acquire the remaining equity interest in White Oak and assumed control of the mine. Prior to the White Oak Acquisition Date, the ARLP Partnership had funded $422.6 million to White Oak under various agreements inclusive of the preferred equity interest purchases. In conjunction with the acquisition of White Oak, the ARLP Partnership assumed $93.5 million of debt which was extinguished in the fourth quarter of 2015 and replaced with a $100 million equipment sale-leaseback arrangement. For more information on this sale-leaseback arrangement, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies.\" In 2015, the ARLP Partnership paid $20.5 million to Patriot to acquire various assets, including certain mining equipment and reserves. The ARLP Partnership also paid $5.5 million in 2015 to acquire the remaining equity interest in MAC. For more information on these acquisitions, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 3. Acquisitions.\"\nCash Flows\nCash provided by operating activities was $554.1 million for 2017 compared to $700.7 million for 2016. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in net income adjusted for non-cash items, a large decrease in coal inventories in 2016 compared to a nominal change in 2017 and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets in 2017 compared to a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets in 2016. These decreases were offset in part by a favorable working capital change in accounts payable in 2017 compared to 2016.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $244.8 million for 2017 compared to $191.8 million for 2016. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to the funding of the ARLP Partnership's new cost investment in Kodiak in 2017 and increased capital expenditures for mine infrastructure and equipment at various mines in 2017 compared to 2016. These increases were partially offset by decreased purchases of equity investments and the lack of customer contract buy-outs both in 2017 compared to 2016.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $345.2 million for 2017 compared to $503.1 million for 2016. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to proceeds received from the issuance of the ARLP Senior Notes, as defined below, and decreased payments under the ARLP Term Loan, as defined below. These decreases in cash used were partially offset by repayment of the ARLP Series B Senior Notes, as defined below, increased overall net payments on the securitization and revolving credit facilities, payment of debt issuance and extinguishment costs and no proceeds received from sales-leaseback transactions in 2017.\nThe ARLP Partnership has various commitments primarily related to long-term debt, including capital leases, operating lease commitments related to buildings and equipment, obligations for estimated future asset retirement obligations costs, workers' compensation and pneumoconiosis, capital projects and pension funding. The ARLP Partnership expects to fund these commitments with existing cash balances, future cash flows from operations and investments as well as cash provided from borrowings of debt or issuance of equity.\nThe following table provides details regarding the ARLP Partnership's contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2017:\n\n (1) Interest on variable-rate, long-term debt was calculated using rates effective at December 31, 2017 for the remaining term of outstanding borrowings. \n (2) Includes amounts classified as interest and maintenance cost. \n (3) Future commitments for reclamation obligations, workers' compensation and pneumoconiosis are shown at undiscounted amounts. These obligations are primarily statutory, not contractual. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business, the ARLP Partnership is a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include coal reserve leases, indemnifications, transportation obligations and financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, such as bank letters of",
    "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGeneral\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data where you can find more detailed information in \"Note 1. Organization and Presentation\" and \"Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" regarding the basis of presentation supporting the following financial information.\nExecutive Overview\nThe AHGP Partnership\nOur cash flows currently consist of distributions from ARLP on our ARLP partnership interests. We reflect our ownership interest in the ARLP Partnership on a consolidated basis, which means that our financial results are combined with the ARLP Partnership's financial results and the results of our other subsidiaries. The earnings of the ARLP Partnership allocated to its limited partners' interests not owned by us and, prior to the Exchange Transaction, the ARLP Partnership earnings allocated to SGP's general partner interest in the ARLP Partnership and the Intermediate Partnership are reflected as a noncontrolling interest in our consolidated income statement and balance sheet. In addition to the ARLP Partnership, our results of operations include the results of operations of MGP II and MGP, our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries.\nThe AHGP Partnership's results of operations principally reflect the results of operations of the ARLP Partnership adjusted for noncontrolling partners' interest in the ARLP Partnership's net income. Accordingly, the discussion of our financial position and results of operations in this \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" reflects the operating activities and results of operations of the ARLP Partnership.\nOur primary business objective is to increase our cash distributions to our unitholders by actively assisting ARLP in executing its business strategy. ARLP's business strategy is to create sustainable, capital-efficient growth in available cash to maximize its distribution to its unitholders by:\n \u00b7 expanding its operations by adding and developing mines and coal reserves in existing, adjacent or neighboring properties; \n \u00b7 extending the lives of its current mining operations through acquisition and development of coal reserves using its existing infrastructure; \n \u00b7 continuing to make productivity improvements to remain a low-cost producer in each region in which it operates; \n \u00b7 strengthening its position with existing and future customers by offering a broad range of coal qualities, transportation alternatives and customized services; \n \u00b7 developing strategic relationships to take advantage of opportunities within the coal industry and MLP sector; and \n \u00b7 continuing to make accretive investments in oil and gas related activities, such as oil and gas mineral interests and gas compression services in various geographic locations within producing basins in the continental U.S. \nThe ARLP Partnership\nThe ARLP Partnership is a diversified producer and marketer of coal primarily to major U.S. utilities and industrial users and was the first such producer and marketer in the nation to be a publicly traded master limited partnership. The ARLP Partnership is currently the second-largest coal producer in the eastern U. S. In 2017, the ARLP Partnership produced and sold 37.6 million and 37.8 million tons of coal, respectively. The coal it sold in 2017 was approximately 25.4% low-sulfur coal, 39.9% medium-sulfur coal and 34.7% high-sulfur coal. Based on market expectations, the ARLP Partnership classifies low-sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of less than 1.5%, medium-sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of 1.5% to 3%, and high-sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of greater than 3%. The BTU content of the ARLP Partnership's coal ranges from 11,400 to 13,200.\nThe ARLP Partnership operates eight underground mining complexes in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, and West Virginia, as well as a coal-loading terminal on the Ohio River at Mt. Vernon, Indiana. In addition, the ARLP Partnership owns equity interests in various oil and gas mineral interests and gas compression services in various geographic locations within producing basins in the continental U.S. At December 31, 2017, the ARLP Partnership had approximately 1.67 billion tons of proven and probable coal reserves in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. We believe the ARLP Partnership controls adequate reserves to implement its currently contemplated mining plans. Please see \"Item 1. Business-Mining Operations\" for further discussion of the ARLP Partnership's mines.\nOn July 19, 2017, Alliance Minerals purchased $100 million of Series A-1 Preferred Interests from Kodiak, a privately-held company providing large-scale, high-utilization gas compression assets to customers operating primarily in the Permian Basin. On July 31, 2015, Hamilton acquired the remaining equity interests of White Oak, from White Oak Finance Inc. and other parties. Prior to the acquisition the ARLP Partnership leased coal reserves to White Oak and owned and operated certain surface facilities at White Oak's mining complex. For more information on the White Oak Acquisition, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 3. Acquisitions.\"\nIn 2017, approximately 80.0% of the ARLP Partnership's sales tonnage was purchased by U.S. electric utilities, with the balance sold to third-party resellers and industrial consumers. Although many utility customers recently have appeared to favor a shorter-term contracting strategy, in 2017, approximately 71.7% of the ARLP Partnership's sales tonnage was sold under long-term contracts. The ARLP Partnership's long-term contracts contribute to its stability and profitability by providing greater predictability of sales volumes and sales prices. In 2017, approximately 85.9% of the medium- and high-sulfur coal was sold to utility plants with installed pollution control devices. These devices, also known as scrubbers, eliminate substantially all emissions of sulfur dioxide.\nAs discussed in more detail in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors,\" the ARLP Partnership's results of operations could be impacted by prices for items that are used in coal production such as steel, electricity and other supplies, unforeseen geologic conditions or mining and processing equipment failures and unexpected maintenance problems, and by the availability or reliability of transportation for coal shipments. Moreover, the regulatory environment in which we operate has grown increasingly stringent as a result of legislation and initiatives pursued during the years prior to the current Trump administration. Additionally, the ARLP Partnership's results of operations could be impacted by its ability to obtain and renew permits necessary for its operations, secure or acquire coal reserves, or find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts. As outlined in \"Item 1. Business-Regulation and Laws,\" a variety of measures taken by regulatory agencies in the U.S. and abroad in response to the perceived threat from climate change attributed to GHG emissions could substantially increase compliance costs for the ARLP Partnership and its customers and reduce demand for coal, which could materially and adversely impact its results of operations. For additional information regarding some of the risks and uncertainties that affect the ARLP Partnership's business and the industry in which it operates, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAs discussed above, on February 22, 2018, our Board of Directors and the board of directors of ARLP's general partner approved the Simplification Agreement, pursuant to which we would become a wholly owned subsidiary of ARLP. For more information regarding the Simplification Agreement, please see 'Item 1. Business - Simplification Transactions.'\nThe ARLP Partnership's principal expenses related to the production of coal are labor and benefits, equipment, materials and supplies, maintenance, royalties and excise taxes. The ARLP Partnership employs a totally union-free workforce. Many of the benefits of the ARLP Partnership's union-free workforce are related to higher productivity and are not necessarily reflected in its direct costs. In addition, transportation costs may be substantial and are often the determining factor in a coal consumer's contracting decision.\nThe ARLP Partnership's mining operations are located near many of the major eastern utility generating plants and on major coal hauling railroads in the eastern U.S. The River View and Tunnel Ridge mines and Mt. Vernon transloading facility are located on the Ohio River and the idled Onton mine is located on the Green River in western Kentucky.\nWe have two reportable segments: Illinois Basin and Appalachia and an \"all other\" category referred to as Other and Corporate. Our reportable segments correspond to major coal producing regions in the eastern U.S. Factors similarly affecting financial performance of our operating segments within each of these two reportable segments generally include coal quality, geology, coal marketing opportunities, mining and transportation methods and regulatory issues.\n \u00b7 Illinois Basin reportable segment is comprised of multiple operating segments, including currently operating mining complexes (a) Webster County Coal's Dotiki mining complex, (b) Gibson County Coal's mining complex, which includes the Gibson North and Gibson South mines, (c) Warrior's mining complex, (d) River View's mining complex and (e) the Hamilton mining complex. The Gibson North mine has been idled since the fourth quarter of 2015 in response to market conditions but is expected to resume production in 2018. \nThe Illinois Basin reportable segment also includes White County Coal's Pattiki mining complex, Hopkins County Coal's mining complex, which includes the Elk Creek mine, the Pleasant View surface mineable reserves and the Fies underground project, Sebree's mining complex, which includes the Onton mine, Steamport and certain reserves, CR Services, LLC, CR Machine Shop, LLC, certain properties and equipment of Alliance Resource Properties, ARP Sebree, LLC, ARP Sebree South, LLC, and UC Coal, LLC and its subsidiaries, UC Mining, LLC, and UC Processing, LLC. The Pattiki mine ceased production in December 2016. The Elk Creek mine depleted its reserves in March 2016 and ceased production on April 1, 2016. The ARLP Partnership's Onton mine has been idled since the fourth quarter of 2015 in response to market conditions. UC Coal, LLC equipment assets acquired in 2015 continue to be deployed as needed at various Illinois Basin operating mines.\n \u00b7 Appalachia reportable segment is comprised of multiple operating segments, including the Mettiki mining complex, the Tunnel Ridge mining complex and the MC Mining mining complex. The Mettiki mining complex includes Mettiki (WV)'s Mountain View mine and Mettiki (MD)'s preparation plant. \n \u00b7 Other and Corporate includes marketing and administrative activities, ASI and its subsidiaries included in the Matrix Group, ASI's ownership of aircraft, the Alliance Partnership's Mt. Vernon dock activities; Alliance Coal's coal brokerage activity, MAC's manufacturing and sales (primarily to the ARLP Partnership's mines) of rock dust, certain of Alliance Resource Properties' land and mineral interest activities, Pontiki Coal, LLC's (\"Pontiki\") legacy workers' compensation and pneumoconiosis liabilities, Wildcat Insurance, which assists the ARLP Partnership with its insurance requirements, Alliance Minerals, and its affiliate, Cavalier Minerals, both of which hold equity investments in various AllDale Partnerships, Alliance Mineral's investment in Kodiak, AROP Funding, LLC (\"AROP Funding\"), and our new subsidiary formed March 30, 2017, Alliance Resource Finance Corporation (\"Alliance Finance\"). Please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 7. Long-Term Debt\", \"-Note 10. Variable Interest Entities\" and \"-Note 12. Investments\" for more information on AROP Funding, Alliance Finance, Alliance Minerals, Cavalier Minerals, the AllDale Partnerships and Kodiak. \nHow the ARLP Partnership Evaluates its Performance\nThe ARLP Partnership's management uses a variety of financial and operational measurements to analyze its performance. Primary measurements include the following: (1) raw and saleable tons produced per unit shift; (2) coal sales price per ton; (3) Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton; (4) EBITDA; and (5) Segment Adjusted EBITDA.\nRaw and Saleable Tons Produced per Unit Shift. The ARLP Partnership reviews raw and saleable tons produced per unit shift as part of its operational analysis to measure the productivity of its operating segments, which is significantly influenced by mining conditions and the efficiency of its preparation plants. A discussion of mining conditions and preparation plant costs are found below under \"-Analysis of Historical Results of Operations\" and therefore provides implicit analysis of raw and saleable tons produced per unit shift.\nCoal Sales Price per Ton. The ARLP Partnership defines coal sales price per ton as total coal sales divided by tons sold. The ARLP Partnership reviews coal sales price per ton to evaluate marketing efforts and for market demand and trend analysis.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per Ton. The ARLP Partnership defines Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton (a non-GAAP financial measure) as the sum of operating expenses, coal purchases and other income divided by total tons sold. The ARLP Partnership reviews Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton for cost trends.\nEBITDA. The ARLP Partnership defines EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) as net income (prior to the allocation of noncontrolling interest) before net interest expense, income taxes and depreciation, depletion and amortization. EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by the ARLP Partnership's management and by external users of its financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others. The ARLP Partnership believes that the presentation of EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding its performance and results of operations because EBITDA, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, (i) provides additional information about our core operating performance and ability to generate and distribute cash flow, (ii) provides investors with the financial analytical framework upon which the ARLP Partnership bases financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions and (iii) presents a measurement that investors, rating agencies and debt holders have indicated is useful in assessing that ARLP Partnership and its results of operations.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA. The ARLP Partnership defines Segment Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) as net income (prior to the allocation of noncontrolling interest) before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, asset impairment, acquisition gain, net, debt extinguishment loss and general and administrative expenses. Management therefore is able to focus solely on the evaluation of segment operating profitability as it relates to our revenues and operating expenses, which are primarily controlled by our segments.\nAnalysis of Historical Results of Operations\n2017 Compared with 2016\nWe reported net income of $302.3 million for 2017 compared to $336.6 million for 2016. The decrease of $34.3 million was due to lower coal sales price realizations offset in part by increased sales volumes, decreased operating expenses, reduced depreciation, depletion and amortization and increased income from the oil and gas investments. Total revenues decreased to $1.80 billion in 2017 compared to $1.93 billion in 2016 as the anticipated reduction in coal sales prices more than offset increased sales volumes and other sales and operating revenues. Even though sales and production volumes increased for 2017, operating expenses were lower compared to 2016, reflecting initiatives to shift production to lower-cost operations. The favorable production cost mix and lower selling expenses in 2017 significantly lowered operating expenses per ton sold compared to 2016. Results presented for 2016 have been recast to reflect a reclassification of depreciation and depletion capitalized into coal inventory as an adjustment to depreciation, depletion and amortization rather than operating expenses.\nTable 208: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(per ton sold)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTons sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n37,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n36,680\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nN/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nN/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTons produced\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n37,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n35,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nN/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nN/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCoal sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,711,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,861,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n45.24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n50.76\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating expenses and outside coal purchases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,095,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,126,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n28.95\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n30.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCoal sales. Coal sales decreased $150.7 million or 8.1% to $1.71 billion for 2017 from $1.86 billion for 2016. The decrease was attributable to lower average coal sales prices, which reduced coal sales by $208.7 million, partially offset by the benefit of increased tons sold, which contributed $58.0 million in additional coal sales. Average coal sales prices decreased $5.52 per ton sold in 2017 to $45.24 compared to $50.76 per ton sold in 2016, primarily due to the expiration of higher-priced legacy contracts, partially offset by higher price realizations at the Mettiki mine from its participation in the metallurgical coal markets in 2017 and improved prices at the MC Mining mine. Sales and production volumes rose to 37.8 million tons sold and 37.6 million tons produced in 2017 compared to 36.7 million\ntons sold and 35.2 million tons produced in 2016, primarily due to strong performances at the Hamilton, Gibson South, Mettiki, MC Mining and Tunnel Ridge mines.\nOperating expenses and outside coal purchases. Operating expenses and outside coal purchases decreased 2.8% to $1.10 billion for 2017 from $1.13 billion for 2016 primarily as a result of the previously discussed favorable production cost mix. On a per ton basis, operating expenses and outside coal purchases decreased 5.7% to $28.95 per ton sold from $30.71 per ton sold in 2016, due primarily to increased sales and production volumes and the previously discussed initiatives to shift production to lower-cost operations. The most significant operating expense variances by category are discussed below:\n \u00b7 Labor and benefit expenses per ton produced, excluding workers' compensation, decreased 13.2% to $9.24 per ton in 2017 from $10.65 per ton in 2016. This decrease of $1.41 per ton was primarily attributable to lower labor and benefit costs per ton due to fewer employees resulting in part from the increased mix of lower-cost production as well as lower health care benefit expenses; and \n \u00b7 Production taxes and royalty expenses decreased $0.49 per produced ton sold in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily as a result of lower excise taxes per ton resulting from a favorable state production mix, increased export sales and lower average coal sales prices. \nOperating expenses and outside coal purchases per ton decreases discussed above were partially offset by the following increases:\n \u00b7 Material and supplies expenses per ton produced increased 1.9% to $9.76 per ton in 2017 from $9.58 per ton in 2016. The increase of $0.18 per ton produced resulted primarily from increases of $0.27 per ton for contract labor used in the mining process and $0.12 per ton for roof support, partially offset by the increased mix of lower-cost production and a related decrease of $0.10 per ton for power and fuel used in the mining process; and \n \u00b7 Maintenance expenses per ton produced increased 7.7% to $3.34 per ton in 2017 from $3.10 per ton in 2016. The increase of $0.24 per ton produced was primarily due to increased maintenance expenses at several mines in both reportable segments due in part to the use of surplus equipment from the ARLP Partnership's idled mines. \nOther sales and operating revenues. Other sales and operating revenues were principally comprised of Mt. Vernon transloading revenues, Matrix Design sales and other outside services. Other sales and operating revenues increased to $43.0 million in 2017 from $39.1 million in 2016. The increase of $3.9 million was primarily due to increased mining technology product sales by Matrix Design and increased transloading revenues from Mt. Vernon, partially offset in comparison to 2016 by proceeds of coal supply contract buy-outs received in 2016.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses for 2017 decreased to $63.3 million compared to $75.1 million in 2016. The decrease of $11.8 million was primarily due to lower incentive compensation expenses.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense decreased to $269.0 million for 2017 compared to $336.5 million for 2016 primarily as a result of the depletion of reserves at the Elk Creek mine in the first quarter of 2016, closure of the Pattiki mine in the fourth quarter of 2016, volume reductions at the Dotiki and Warrior mines, the use of surplus equipment from idled mines and ongoing capital reduction initiatives at all of the ARLP Partnerships' operations.\nInterest expense. Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, increased to $39.4 million in 2017 from $30.7 million in 2016 primarily due to interest incurred under the ARLP Senior Notes issued in April 2017, offset in part by reduced borrowings under the ARLP revolving credit facility and the payment of the ARLP Term Loan and ARLP Series B Senior Notes. Interest payable under the ARLP Partnership's Senior Notes, revolving credit facility, Term Loan and Series B Senior Notes is discussed below under \"-Debt Obligations.\"\nEquity investment income. Equity investment income increased to $13.9 million in 2017 from $3.5 million in 2016 due to increased income from the ARLP Partnership's investments in the AllDale Partnerships.\nCost investment income. Distributions of additional preferred interests received from the ARLP Partnership's new Kodiak investment contributed $6.4 million of cost investment income to 2017.\nDebt extinguishment loss. The ARLP Partnership recognized a debt extinguishment loss of $8.1 million in 2017 to reflect a make-whole payment incurred to repay the ARLP Partnership's Series B Senior Notes in May 2017.\nTransportation revenues and expenses. Transportation revenues and expenses were $41.7 million and $30.1 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase of $11.6 million was primarily attributable to increased tonnage for which the ARLP Partnership arranges third-party transportation at certain mines and an increase in average third-party transportation rates in 2017. The cost of third-party transportation services are passed through to the ARLP Partnership's customers.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests. The net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was $116.3 million and $150.6 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is due to an increased percentage allocation of the ARLP Partnership's net income to AHGP due to increased cash distributions to AHGP as a result of the Exchange Transaction in addition to a decrease in the consolidated net income of the ARLP Partnership due to the changes in revenues and expenses described above.\nSegment Information. Our 2017 Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 12.4% to $682.2 million from 2016 Segment Adjusted EBITDA of $778.8 million. Segment Adjusted EBITDA, tons sold, coal sales, other sales and operating revenues and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense by segment are as follows:\nTable 213: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures, please see below under \"-Reconciliation of non-GAAP \"Segment Adjusted EBITDA\" to GAAP \"net income\" and reconciliation of non-GAAP \"Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense\" to GAAP \"Operating Expenses.\" Results presented for Segment Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense for 2016 have been recast to reflect a reclassification of depreciation and depletion capitalized into coal inventory as adjustments to depreciation, depletion and amortization rather than operating expenses. \nIllinois Basin - Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 29.1% to $391.4 million in 2017 from $552.3 million in 2016. The decrease of $160.9 million was primarily attributable to lower coal sales, which decreased 17.5% to $1.08 billion in 2017 from $1.31 billion in 2016, partially offset by decreased expenses resulting from a favorable production mix. The coal sales decrease of $228.0 million primarily reflects lower average coal sales prices of $39.90 per ton in\n2017 compared to $48.54 per ton in 2016, primarily resulting from the expiration of higher-priced legacy contracts. Lower sales prices were partially offset by increased tons sold, which increased slightly to 27.0 million tons in 2017 from 26.9 million tons in 2016. Higher sales volumes resulted from strong performances at the Gibson South and Hamilton mines, offset in part by the previously mentioned depletion of reserves at the Elk Creek mine in the 2016 first quarter, the closure of the Pattiki mine in the 2016 fourth quarter and reduced sales at the Dotiki mine. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense decreased 9.6% to $688.5 million in 2017 from $761.6 million in 2016 and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton decreased $2.83 per ton sold to $25.47 compared to $28.30 per ton sold in 2016, primarily due to a significant increase in low-cost longwall production from the Hamilton mine, increased production at the Gibson South operation and a related reduced mix of sales volumes from higher cost mines, as well as reduced selling expenses, lower health care benefit expenses and certain cost decreases described above under \"-Operating expenses and outside coal purchases.\"\nAppalachia - Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 22.3% to $234.1 million for 2017 from $191.5 million in 2016. The increase of $42.6 million was primarily attributable to increased coal sales, which rose 15.2% to $616.3 million in 2017 compared to $534.8 million in 2016, partially offset by higher Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense. The increase of $81.5 million in coal sales resulted from higher sales volumes across the region, which increased 10.8% to 10.8 million tons sold in 2017 compared to 9.7 million tons sold in 2016, and higher average coal sales prices of $57.16 per ton in 2017 compared to $54.94 per ton in 2016. Higher price realizations in 2017 were a result of sales from the ARLP Partnership's Mettiki mine into the metallurgic coal export market and improved prices at the MC Mining mine. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense increased 11.3% to $385.8 million in 2017 from $346.7 million in 2016 due to increased sales volumes. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton increased slightly to $35.78 per ton compared to $35.62 per ton sold in 2016, primarily due to an increased sales mix of higher-cost Mettiki production in 2017 and reduced recoveries from the Tunnel Ridge mine.\nOther and Corporate - Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased by $19.5 million to $65.4 million in 2017 compared to $45.9 million in 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to higher equity investment income from the AllDale Partnerships, distributions of additional preferred interests received from Kodiak and increased mining technology product sales by Matrix Design. In 2017, Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense decreased to $83.5 million for 2017 compared to $89.6 million for 2016 primarily as a result of decreased coal brokerage activity.\nElimination - Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense eliminations decreased in 2017 to $65.6 million from $72.3 million in 2016 and coal sales eliminations decreased to $58.4 million from $65.4 million in 2016, reflecting decreased intercompany coal sales brokerage activity.\n2016 Compared with 2015\nWe reported net income of $336.6 million for 2016 compared to $304.2 million for 2015, an increase of $32.4 million. Comparative results between the years reflect in part the negative net impact in 2015 of $77.6 million of certain large non-cash items (\"Non-Cash Items\") described below and $48.5 million of equity investment loss related to White Oak also in 2015. Net income in 2016 was negatively impacted by reduced revenues compared to 2015 resulting from planned reductions in coal sales and production volumes, lower coal sales prices, lower other sales and operating revenues due to the absence of coal royalty and surface facilities revenues from White Oak in 2016, offset in part by reduced operating expenses in 2016. Lower operating expenses during 2016 primarily reflect decreased sales volumes and a favorable production cost mix resulting from the initiative to shift production to lower-cost per ton operations. Lower volumes in 2016 resulted from idling the Onton and Gibson North mines in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the planned depletion of reserves at the Elk Creek mine in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by additional volumes from the Tunnel Ridge and Gibson South operations and the Hamilton mine acquired in the White Oak Acquisition. The Non-Cash Items in 2015 included asset impairments of $100.1 million offset in part by a net gain of $22.5 million related to final business combination accounting for the White Oak Acquisition.

Coal sales decreased $296.2 million or 13.7% to $1.86 billion for 2016 from $2.16 billion for 2015. The decrease was attributable to a volume variance of $191.2 million resulting from reduced tons sold as discussed above and a price variance of $105.0 million due to lower average coal sales prices. Average coal sales prices decreased $2.86 per ton sold in 2016 to $50.76 compared to $53.62 per ton sold in 2015, primarily due to lower-priced legacy contracts at the Hamilton mine inherited in the White Oak Acquisition and lower average prices at certain mines, particularly at the Gibson South, Dotiki, Tunnel Ridge and MC Mining operations, as a result of challenging market conditions.\nOperating expenses and outside coal purchases. Operating expenses and outside coal purchases decreased 18.8% to $1.13 billion for 2016 from $1.39 billion for 2015 primarily as a result of the previously discussed reductions to coal production volumes and a favorable production cost mix. On a per ton basis, operating expenses and outside coal purchases decreased 10.9% to $30.71 per ton sold from $34.46 per ton sold in 2015, due primarily to the lower-cost production mix and higher productivity from the Tunnel Ridge and Gibson South mines. Operating expenses were impacted by various other factors, the most significant of which are discussed below:\n \u00b7 Labor and benefit expenses per ton produced, excluding workers' compensation, decreased 7.8% to $10.65 per ton in 2016 from $11.55 per ton in 2015. This decrease of $0.90 per ton was primarily attributable to the increased mix of lower-cost production discussed above and reduced overtime in response to market conditions; \n \u00b7 Material and supplies expenses per ton produced decreased 14.8% to $9.58 per ton in 2016 from $11.25 per ton in 2015. The decrease of $1.67 per ton produced resulted primarily from the increased mix of lower-cost production discussed above and related decreases of $0.77 per ton for roof support, $0.47 per ton for contract labor used in the mining process and $0.24 per ton for certain ventilation expenses partially offset by increases of $0.22 per ton for equipment rentals primarily due to equipment leases assumed in the White Oak Acquisition and $0.15 per ton for environmental and reclamation expenses; \n \u00b7 Maintenance expenses per ton produced decreased 21.1% to $3.10 per ton in 2016 from $3.93 per ton in 2015. The decrease of $0.83 per ton produced was primarily due to production variances at certain mines discussed above; and \n \u00b7 Production taxes and royalties expenses incurred as a percentage of coal sales prices and volumes decreased $0.39 per produced ton sold in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily as a result of lower excise taxes per ton resulting from a favorable state production mix and lower average coal sales prices discussed above; \nOperating expenses and outside coal purchases per ton decreases discussed above were partially offset by the following increase:\n \u00b7 Operating expenses were increased by a 1.4 million ton inventory reduction and related inventory cost adjustments in 2016 as compared to a 1.0 million ton inventory increase and related inventory cost adjustments in 2015. \nOther sales and operating revenues. Other sales and operating revenues were principally comprised of Mt. Vernon transloading revenues, Matrix Design sales, other outside services and in 2015, surface facility services and\ncoal royalty revenues received from White Oak prior to the White Oak Acquisition in July 2015. Other sales and operating revenues decreased to $39.1 million in 2016 from $81.7 million in 2015. The decrease of $42.6 million was primarily due to the absence of coal royalty and surface facilities revenues from White Oak in 2016.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses for 2016 increased to $75.1 million compared to $69.1 million in 2015. The increase of $6.0 million was primarily due to higher incentive compensation expenses.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (\"DD&A\") expense for 2016 increased to $336.5 million compared to $324.0 million in 2015. The increase of $12.5 million was primarily due to increases in DD&A associated with the Pattiki mine, which ceased production in December 2016 and the acquisition of the Hamilton mine in July 2015, partially offset by the previously discussed volume reductions at the Onton, Gibson North, and Elk Creek mines. .\nAsset impairment. In 2015, the ARLP Partnership recorded $100.1 million of impairment charges comprised of a $66.9 million impairment related to the idling of the Onton mine, a $19.5 million impairment at the MC Mining complex, primarily due to lower coal sales prices, and a $13.7 million impairment due to the surrender in 2015 of leases of undeveloped coal reserves and related property. No asset impairments were recorded in 2016.\nInterest expense. Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, decreased slightly to $30.7 million in 2016 from $31.2 million in 2015 primarily due to the repayment of the ARLP Series A senior notes in June 2015 offset in part by additional interest incurred under capital lease obligations. Interest payable under the ARLP senior notes, ARLP term loan, ARLP revolving credit facility and capital lease financings is discussed below under \"-Debt Obligations.\"\nEquity investment income (loss). Equity investment income (loss) for 2016 includes Cavalier Minerals' equity method investments in AllDale Minerals. In addition to AllDale Minerals, 2015 also includes the ARLP Partnership's equity method investment in White Oak. For 2016, the ARLP Partnership recognized equity investment income of $3.5 million compared to equity investment loss of $49.0 million for 2015. As discussed above, as a result of the White Oak Acquisition in July 2015, the ARLP Partnership no longer accounts for the Hamilton mine financial results as an equity method investment in its consolidated financials, but now consolidates Hamilton in its financial results. Thus, the change in equity investment income (loss) was primarily due to the elimination of equity losses related to White Oak as well as an increase in equity income from AllDale Minerals.\nAcquisition gain, net. In 2015, the ARLP Partnership recognized a $22.5 million non-cash net gain related to the final business combination accounting for the White Oak Acquisition. For more information on the White Oak Acquisition, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 3. Acquisitions.\"\nTransportation revenues and expenses. Transportation revenues and expenses were $30.1 million and $33.6 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease of $3.5 million was primarily attributable to a decrease in average transportation rates in 2016, partially offset by increased tonnage for which the ARLP Partnership arranges transportation at certain mines. The cost of transportation services are passed through to the ARLP Partnership's customers.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests. The net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was $150.6 million and $92.8 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interest is due to an increase in the consolidated net income of the ARLP Partnership due to the changes in revenues and expenses described above and a greater proportion of the ARLP Partnership's net income being attributed to its limited partner interests rather than our general partner interest reflecting a decrease in ARLP's managing general partner's priority distribution to us resulting from the ARLP Partnership's lower unit distribution rate of $1.75 in 2016 as compared to $2.69 in 2015.\nSegment Information. Our 2016 Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 3.2% to $778.8 million from 2015 Segment Adjusted EBITDA of $804.5 million. Segment Adjusted EBITDA, tons sold, coal sales, other sales and operating revenues and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense by segment are as follows:\nTable 221: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures, please see below under \"-Reconciliation of non-GAAP \"Segment Adjusted EBITDA\" to GAAP \"net income\" and reconciliation of non-GAAP \"Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense\" to GAAP \"Operating Expenses.\" Results presented for Segment Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense for 2016 and 2015 have been recast to reflect a reclassification of depreciation and depletion capitalized into coal inventory as adjustments to depreciation, depletion and amortization rather than operating expenses. \nIllinois Basin - Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 8.7% to $552.3 million in 2016 from $604.8 million in 2015, a decrease of $52.5 million. Segment Adjusted EBITDA in 2016 was negatively impacted by reduced revenues compared to 2015 resulting from planned reductions in coal sales and production volumes, lower coal sales prices, lower other sales and operating revenues due to the absence of coal royalty and surface facilities revenues from White\nOak in 2016, offset in part by reduced operating expenses in 2016. Comparative results between the years also reflect the negative impact in 2015 of $48.5 million of equity investment loss related to White Oak prior to the White Oak Acquisition in July 2015. Coal sales decreased 16.9% to $1.31 billion compared to $1.57 billion in 2015. The coal sales decrease of $264.8 million primarily reflects the previously discussed reduction of coal sales and production volumes at the Onton, Gibson North and Elk Creek mines, partially offset by additional volumes from the Gibson South operation and the Hamilton mine acquired in the White Oak Acquisition. Also impacting 2016 were lower average coal sales prices which decreased 4.8% to $48.54 per ton sold compared to $51.01 per ton sold in 2015 as a result of challenging market conditions and lower-priced legacy contracts at the Hamilton mine inherited in the White Oak Acquisition. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense decreased 20.8% to $761.6 million in 2016 from $961.6 million in 2015 due to reduced production and sales volumes as discussed above. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton decreased $2.92 per ton sold to $28.30 in 2016 from $31.22 per ton sold in 2015, primarily as a result of a favorable production cost mix in 2016 due to reducing production from higher-cost per ton operations and improved recoveries at the Gibson South, River View and Warrior mines, as well as certain cost decreases described above under \"-Operating expenses and outside coal purchases.\"\nAppalachia - Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 2.7% to $191.5 million in 2016 from $186.5 million in 2015. The increase of $5.0 million was primarily attributable to increased tons sold and reduced operating expenses partially offset by lower average coal sales prices of $54.94 per ton sold during 2016 compared to $60.76 per ton sold in 2015. Coal sales decreased 6.7% to $534.8 million in 2016 compared to $573.5 million in 2015. The decrease of $38.7 million was primarily due to lower average coal sales prices at the MC Mining and Tunnel Ridge mines. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense decreased 12.9% to $346.7 million in 2016 from $398.1 million in 2015 and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton decreased $6.55 per ton sold to $35.62 compared to $42.17 per ton sold in 2015, primarily due to a favorable production cost mix resulting from an additional 1.0 million tons being produced from Tunnel Ridge in 2016 compared to 2015 and a reduction in volumes from the higher cost Appalachia mines. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton also benefited from fewer longwall move days and lower roof support expenses, lower selling expenses across the region, and certain other cost decreases described above under \"-Operating expenses and outside coal purchases.\"\nOther and Corporate - In 2016, Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $20.1 million compared to 2015 primarily as a result of increased margins on both safety equipment sales by Matrix Design and coal brokerage sales, as well as an increase in equity income from AllDale Minerals and a reduction in workers' compensation and pneumoconiosis accruals related to Pontiki which sold most of its assets in May 2014. In 2016, coal sales decreased $47.3 million and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense decreased $64.1 million compared to 2015. These decreases primarily resulted from reduced intercompany coal brokerage activity.\nElimination - Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense eliminations decreased in 2016 to $72.3 million from $127.2 million in 2015 and coal sales eliminations decreased to $65.4 million from $120.0 million, respectively, primarily reflecting reduced intercompany coal brokerage activity.\nReconciliation of non-GAAP \"Segment Adjusted EBITDA\" to GAAP \"net income\" and reconciliation of non-GAAP \"Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense\" to GAAP \"Operating Expenses\"\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) is defined as net income (prior to the allocation of noncontrolling interest) before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, asset impairment, acquisition gain, net, debt extinguishment loss and general and administrative expenses. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is a key component of consolidated EBITDA, which is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others. We believe that the presentation of EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our performance and results of operations because EBITDA, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, (i) provides additional information about our core operating performance and ability to generate and distribute cash flow, (ii) provides investors with the financial analytical framework upon which we base financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions and (iii) presents a measurement that investors, rating agencies and debt holders have indicated is useful in assessing us and our results of operations.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA is also used as a supplemental financial measure by our management for reasons similar to those stated in the previous explanation of EBITDA. In addition, the exclusion of corporate general and\nadministrative expenses, which are discussed above under \"-Analysis of Historical Results of Operations,\" from consolidated Segment Adjusted EBITDA allows management to focus solely on the evaluation of segment operating profitability as it relates to our revenues and operating expenses, which are primarily controlled by our segments. Results presented for Segment Adjusted EBITDA for 2016 and 2015 have been recast to reflect a reclassification of depreciation and depletion capitalized into coal inventory as adjustments to depreciation, depletion and amortization rather than operating expenses.\nThe following is a reconciliation of consolidated Segment Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most comparable GAAP financial measure:\nTable 223: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nConsolidated Segment Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n682,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n778,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n804,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeneral and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(63,331)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(75,087)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(69,076)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(268,981)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(336,509)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(323,983)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAsset impairment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(100,130)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(39,283)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(30,655)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(29,693)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAcquisition gain, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n22,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDebt extinguishment loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(8,148)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome tax (expense) benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(211)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(14)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(21)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n302,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n336,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n304,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA Expense (a non-GAAP financial measure) includes operating expenses, coal purchases and other income. Transportation expenses are excluded as these expenses are passed through to the ARLP Partnership's customers and, consequently, it does not realize any gain or loss on transportation revenues. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense is used as a supplemental financial measure by the ARLP Partnership's management to assess the operating performance of the segments. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense is a key component of Segment Adjusted EBITDA in addition to coal sales and other sales and operating revenues.

For more information on acquisitions, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 3. Acquisitions.\"\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nOur only cash generating assets are limited and general partnership interests in the ARLP Partnership, from which we receive quarterly distributions. We rely on distributions from the ARLP Partnership to fund our cash requirements.\nThe ARLP Partnership has historically satisfied its working capital requirements and funded its capital expenditures, investments and debt service obligations with cash generated from operations, cash provided by the issuance of debt or equity, borrowings under credit and securitization facilities and sale-leaseback transactions. The ARLP Partnership believes that existing cash balances, future cash flows from operations and investments, borrowings under credit facilities and cash provided from the issuance of debt or equity will be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements, capital expenditures and additional investments, debt payments, commitments and distribution payments. Nevertheless, the ARLP Partnership's ability to satisfy its working capital requirements, to fund planned capital expenditures and investments, to service its debt obligations or to pay distributions will depend upon its future operating performance and access to and cost of financing sources, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions generally and in the coal industry specifically, as well as other financial and business factors, some of which are beyond its control. Based on the ARLP Partnership's recent operating results, current cash position, current unitholder distributions, anticipated future cash flows and sources of financing that it expects to have available, the ARLP Partnership does not anticipate any constraints to its liquidity at this time. However, to the extent operating cash flow or access to and cost of financing sources are materially different than expected, future liquidity may be adversely affected. Please see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\"\nThe ARLP Partnership owns equity interests in the AllDale Partnerships for the purchase of oil and gas mineral interests in various geographic locations within producing basins in the continental U.S. and plan to make similar additional equity investments in the future. As of December 31, 2017, the ARLP Partnership had provided funding of $163.4 million to AllDale Partnerships. On July 19, 2017, the ARLP Partnership purchased $100 million of Series A-1 Preferred Interests from Kodiak, a privately-held company providing large-scale, high-utilization gas compression assets to customers operating primarily in the Permian Basin. This structured investment provides the ARLP Partnership with a quarterly cash or payment-in-kind return. In 2018, the ARLP Partnership expects investments of approximately $30.0 million for existing commitments related to the AllDale Partnerships and Kodiak investments. For more information on transactions with the AllDale Partnership, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 10. Variable Interest Entities\" and \"Note 12. Investments.\"\nOn September 22, 2011, the ARLP Partnership entered into a series of transactions with White Oak to support development of the White Oak longwall mining operation (now known as the Hamilton mine) including the purchase of preferred equity interests. On July 31, 2015 (\"White Oak Acquisition Date\"), the ARLP Partnership paid $50.0 million to acquire the remaining equity interest in White Oak and assumed control of the mine. Prior to the White Oak Acquisition Date, the ARLP Partnership had funded $422.6 million to White Oak under various agreements inclusive of the preferred equity interest purchases. In conjunction with the acquisition of White Oak, the ARLP Partnership assumed $93.5 million of debt which was extinguished in the fourth quarter of 2015 and replaced with a $100 million equipment sale-leaseback arrangement. For more information on this sale-leaseback arrangement, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies.\" In 2015, the ARLP Partnership paid $20.5 million to Patriot to acquire various assets, including certain mining equipment and reserves. The ARLP Partnership also paid $5.5 million in 2015 to acquire the remaining equity interest in MAC. For more information on these acquisitions, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 3. Acquisitions.\"\nCash Flows\nCash provided by operating activities was $554.1 million for 2017 compared to $700.7 million for 2016. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in net income adjusted for non-cash items, a large decrease in coal inventories in 2016 compared to a nominal change in 2017 and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets in 2017 compared to a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets in 2016. These decreases were offset in part by a favorable working capital change in accounts payable in 2017 compared to 2016.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $244.8 million for 2017 compared to $191.8 million for 2016. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to the funding of the ARLP Partnership's new cost investment in Kodiak in 2017 and increased capital expenditures for mine infrastructure and equipment at various mines in 2017 compared to 2016. These increases were partially offset by decreased purchases of equity investments and the lack of customer contract buy-outs both in 2017 compared to 2016.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $345.2 million for 2017 compared to $503.1 million for 2016. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to proceeds received from the issuance of the ARLP Senior Notes, as defined below, and decreased payments under the ARLP Term Loan, as defined below. These decreases in cash used were partially offset by repayment of the ARLP Series B Senior Notes, as defined below, increased overall net payments on the securitization and revolving credit facilities, payment of debt issuance and extinguishment costs and no proceeds received from sales-leaseback transactions in 2017.\nThe ARLP Partnership has various commitments primarily related to long-term debt, including capital leases, operating lease commitments related to buildings and equipment, obligations for estimated future asset retirement obligations costs, workers' compensation and pneumoconiosis, capital projects and pension funding. The ARLP Partnership expects to fund these commitments with existing cash balances, future cash flows from operations and investments as well as cash provided from borrowings of debt or issuance of equity.\nThe following table provides details regarding the ARLP Partnership's contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 225: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContractual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthan 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1-3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3-5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMore than\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nObligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nyear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n502,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n72,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n30,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n400,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFuture interest obligations(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n224,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n31,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n62,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n60,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n69,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCapital leases(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n92,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n32,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n57,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPurchase obligations for capital projects\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n64,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n64,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReclamation obligations(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n244,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n238,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWorkers' compensation and pneumoconiosis benefit(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n249,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n206,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,394,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n224,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n147,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n108,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n915,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Interest on variable-rate, long-term debt was calculated using rates effective at December 31, 2017 for the remaining term of outstanding borrowings. \n (2) Includes amounts classified as interest and maintenance cost. \n (3) Future commitments for reclamation obligations, workers' compensation and pneumoconiosis are shown at undiscounted amounts.
