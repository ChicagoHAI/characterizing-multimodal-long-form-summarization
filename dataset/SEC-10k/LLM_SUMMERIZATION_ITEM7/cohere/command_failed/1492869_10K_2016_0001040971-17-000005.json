MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nSL Green Realty Corp., which is referred to as SL Green or the Company, a Maryland corporation, and SL Green Operating Partnership, L.P., which is referred to as SLGOP or the Operating Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership, were formed in June 1997 for the purpose of combining the commercial real estate business of S.L. Green Properties, Inc. and its affiliated partnerships and entities. The Company is a self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, with in-house capabilities in commercial and residential property management, acquisitions and dispositions, financing, development and redevelopment, construction and leasing. Unless the context requires otherwise, all references to \"we,\" \"our\" and \"us\" means the Company and all entities owned or controlled by the Company, including the Operating Partnership.\nReckson Associates Realty Corp., or Reckson, and Reckson Operating Partnership, L.P. or ROP, are wholly-owned subsidiaries of the SL Green Realty Corp.\nThe following discussion related to our consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements appearing in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe New York City commercial real estate market remained strong in 2016, and we took advantage of this market in improving asking rents and strategically selling or forming joint venture properties at attractive market valuations.\nLeasing and Operating\nIn 2016, our same-store Manhattan office property occupancy based on leases signed was 97.1% compared to 97.2% in the prior year. We signed office leases in Manhattan encompassing approximately 3.2 million square feet, of which approximately 2.6 million square feet represented office leases that replaced previously occupied space. Our mark-to-market on these approximately 2.6 million square feet of signed Manhattan office leases that replaced previously occupied space was 27.6% for 2016.\nAccording to Cushman & Wakefield, new leasing activity in Manhattan in 2016 totaled approximately 26.3 million square feet. Of the total 2016 leasing activity in Manhattan, the Midtown submarket accounted for approximately 17.9 million square feet, or approximately 68.1%. Midtown's overall office vacancy increased from 8.5% at December 31, 2015 to 9.3% at December 31, 2016.\nOverall average asking rents in Manhattan increased in 2016 by 1.7% from $71.58 per square foot at December 31, 2015 to $72.82 per square foot at December 31, 2016. Midtown Manhattan average asking rents increased in 2016 by 2.3% from $76.65 per square foot at December 31, 2015 to $78.39 per square foot at December 31, 2016. The Midtown South average asking rent rose 1.7% year-over-year to $70.86 per square foot while downtown average asking rents decreased 0.5% year-over-year to $59.30 per square foot.\nAcquisition and Disposition Activity\nOverall Manhattan sales volume decreased by 31.5% in 2016 to $39.6 billion as compared to $57.8 billion in 2015. Consistent with our multi-faceted approach to property acquisitions, we selectively sourced the off-market purchase of a retail and residential mixed-use property that provides value enhancement opportunities for $28.5 million.\nWe also continued to take advantage of significant interest by both international and domestic institutions and individuals seeking ownership interests in Manhattan properties to sell assets, disposing of a significant volume of properties that were non-core or had more limited growth opportunities, raising efficiently priced capital that was used primarily for debt reduction. During the year, we sold all or part of our interest in 11 Madison Avenue, 388-390 Greenwich Street, 885 Third Avenue, 248-252 Bedford Avenue, 400 East 57th Street, 500 West Putnam and 7 International Drive for total gross valuations of $5.3 billion.\nDebt and Preferred Equity\nIn 2015 and 2016, in our debt and preferred equity portfolio we continued to focus on the origination of financings, typically in the form of mezzanine debt, for owners, acquirers or developers of New York City properties. This investment strategy provides us with the opportunity to fill a need for additional debt financing by providing higher leverage than are often available through traditional lending sources, while achieving attractive risk adjusted returns to us on the investments and receiving a significant amount of additional information on the New York City real estate market. The typical investments made by us during 2015 and 2016 were to reputable owners or acquirers which have sizable equity subordinate to our last dollar exposure. During 2016, our debt and preferred equity activities included purchases and originations, inclusive of advances under future funding obligations, discount and fee amortization, and paid-in-kind interest, net of premium amortization, of $1,015 million, and sales, redemption and participations of $1,045 million.\nFor descriptions of significant activities in 2016, refer to \"Part I, Item 1. Business - Highlights from 2016\".\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nInvestment in Commercial Real Estate Properties\nOn a periodic basis, we assess whether there are any indications that the value of our real estate properties may be other than temporarily impaired or that their carrying value may not be recoverable. A property's value is considered impaired if management's estimate of the aggregate future cash flows (undiscounted) to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the calculated fair value of the property.\nWe also evaluate our real estate properties for potential impairment when a real estate property has been classified as held for sale. Real estate assets held for sale are valued at the lower of either their carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. We do not believe that there were any indicators of impairment at any of our consolidated properties at December 31, 2016\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a $10.4 million charge in connection with the sale of one property, 500 West Putnam, which closed in the third quarter of 2016. This charge is included in depreciable real estate reserves in the consolidated statements of operations.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded a $19.2 million charge in connection with the sale of two of our properties, which closed in the fourth quarter of 2015. This charge is included in depreciable real estate reserves in the consolidated statements of operations.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, we entered into an agreement to sell 885 Third Avenue and recorded a $6.6 million charge which was included in gain on sale of real estate, net in the consolidated statement of operations. At December 31, 2015, 885 Third Avenue was not reclassified as held for sale as a result of not meeting the criteria in ASC 360-10, Property, Plant and Equipment - Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. In February 2016, we closed on the sale of this property but do not anticipate meeting the criteria for the full accrual method in ASC 360-20, Property, Plant and Equipment - Real Estate Sales and as a result the property will remain on our consolidated balance sheet until the criteria is met.\nWe incur a variety of costs in the development and leasing of our properties. After determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. The costs of land and building under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include, but are not limited to, pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. We consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year after major construction activity is completed. We cease capitalization on the portions substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy, and capitalize only those costs associated with the portions under construction.\nResults of operations of properties acquired are included in the consolidated statements of operations from the date of acquisition.\nWe recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed (including contingencies) and any noncontrolling interests in an acquired entity at their fair values on the acquisition date. We expense transaction costs related to the acquisition of certain assets as incurred, which are included in transaction related costs on our consolidated statements of operations.\nWhen we acquire our partner's equity interest in an existing unconsolidated joint venture and gain control over the investment, we record the consolidated investment at fair value. The difference between the book value of our equity investment on the purchase date and our share of the fair value of the investment's purchase price is recorded as a purchase price fair value adjustment in our consolidated statements of operations. In December 2015, we recognized a purchase price fair value adjustment of $40.1 million in connection with the consolidation of 600 Lexington Avenue. In May 2014, we recognized a purchase price fair value adjustment\nof $71.4 million in connection with the consolidation of 388-390 Greenwich Street. These acquisitions were previously accounted for as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures.\nWe allocate the purchase price of real estate to land and building (inclusive of tenant improvements) and, if determined to be material, intangibles, such as the value of above- and below-market leases and origination costs associated with the in-place leases. We depreciate the amount allocated to building (inclusive of tenant improvements) over their estimated useful lives, which generally range from three to 40 years. We amortize the amount allocated to the above- and below-market leases over the remaining term of the associated lease, which generally range from one to 14 years, and record it as either an increase (in the case of below-market leases) or a decrease (in the case of above-market leases) to rental income. We amortize the amount allocated to the values associated with in-place leases over the expected term of the associated lease, which generally ranges from one to 14 years. If a tenant vacates its space prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related intangible will be written off. The tenant improvements and origination costs are amortized as an expense over the remaining life of the lease (or charged against earnings if the lease is terminated prior to its contractual expiration date). We assess fair value of the leases based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property. To the extent acquired leases contain fixed rate renewal options that are below-market and determined to be material, we amortize such below-market lease value into rental income over the renewal period.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\nWe account for our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting in cases where we exercise significant influence over, but do not control, these entities and are not considered to be the primary beneficiary. We consolidate those joint ventures that we control or which are VIEs and where we are considered to be the primary beneficiary. In all these joint ventures, the rights of the joint venture partner are both protective as well as participating. Unless we are determined to be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, these participating rights preclude us from consolidating these VIE entities. These investments are recorded initially at cost, as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, and subsequently adjusted for equity in net income (loss) and cash contributions and distributions. Equity in net income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures is allocated based on our ownership or economic interest in each joint venture. When a capital event (as defined in each joint venture agreement) such as a refinancing occurs, if return thresholds are met, future equity income will be allocated at our increased economic interest. We recognize incentive income from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures as income to the extent it is earned and not subject to a clawback feature. Distributions we receive from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures in excess of our basis in the investment are recorded as offsets to our investment balance if we remain liable for future obligations of the joint venture or may otherwise be committed to provide future additional financial support. None of the joint venture debt is recourse to us. The Company has performance guarantees under master leases at two joint ventures. See Note 6, \"Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures.\"\nWe assess our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures for recoverability, and if it is determined that a loss in value of the investment is other than temporary, we write down the investment to its fair value. We evaluate our equity investments for impairment based on the joint ventures' projected discounted cash flows. We do not believe that the values of any of our equity investments were impaired at December 31, 2016.\nWe may originate loans for real estate acquisition, development and construction, where we expect to receive some of the residual profit from such projects. When the risk and rewards of these arrangements are essentially the same as an investor or joint venture partner, we account for these arrangements as real estate investments under the equity method of accounting for investments. Otherwise, we account for these arrangements consistent with our loan accounting for our debt and preferred equity investments.\nRevenue Recognition\nRental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases are included in deferred rents receivable on the consolidated balance sheets. We establish, on a current basis, an allowance for future potential tenant credit losses, which may occur against this account. The balance reflected on the consolidated balance sheets is net of such allowance.\nWe record a gain on sale of real estate when title is conveyed to the buyer, subject to the buyer's financial commitment being sufficient to provide economic substance to the sale and provided that we have no substantial economic involvement with the buyer.\nInterest income on debt and preferred equity investments is accrued based on the contractual terms of the instruments and when, in the opinion of management, it is deemed collectible. Some debt and preferred equity investments provide for accrual of interest at specified rates, which differ from current payment terms. Interest is recognized on such loans at the accrual rate subject to management's determination that accrued interest is ultimately collectible, based on the underlying collateral and operations of the borrower. If management cannot make this determination, interest income above the current pay rate is recognized only upon actual receipt.\nDeferred origination fees, original issue discounts and loan origination costs, if any, are recognized as an adjustment to the interest income over the terms of the related investments using the effective interest method. Fees received in connection with loan commitments are also deferred until the loan is funded and are then recognized over the term of the loan as an adjustment to yield.\nDebt and preferred equity investments are placed on a non-accrual status at the earlier of the date at which payments become 90 days past due or when, in the opinion of management, a full recovery of interest income becomes doubtful. Interest income recognition on any non-accrual debt or preferred equity investment is resumed when such non-accrual debt or preferred equity investment becomes contractually current and performance is demonstrated to be resumed. Interest is recorded as income on impaired loans only to the extent cash is received.\nWe may syndicate a portion of the loans that we originate or sell the loans individually. When a transaction meets the criteria for sale accounting, we derecognize the loan sold and recognize gain or loss based on the difference between the sales price and the carrying value of the loan sold. Any related unamortized deferred origination fees, original issue discounts, loan origination costs, discounts or premiums at the time of sale are recognized as an adjustment to the gain or loss on sale, which is included in investment income on the consolidated statement of operations. Any fees received at the time of sale or syndication are recognized as part of investment income.\nAsset management fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the asset management agreement.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our tenants to make required payments. If the financial condition of a specific tenant were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of its ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.\nReserve for Possible Credit Losses\nThe expense for possible credit losses in connection with debt and preferred equity investments is the charge to earnings to increase the allowance for possible credit losses to the level that we estimate to be adequate, based on Level 3 data, considering delinquencies, loss experience and collateral quality. Other factors considered include geographic trends, product diversification, the size of the portfolio and current economic conditions. Based upon these factors, we establish a provision for possible credit loss on each individual investment. When it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts contractually due, the investment is considered impaired.\nWhere impairment is indicated on an investment that is held to maturity, a valuation allowance is measured based upon the excess of the recorded investment amount over the net fair value of the collateral. Any deficiency between the carrying amount of an asset and the calculated value of the collateral is charged to expense. We continue to assess or adjust our estimates based on circumstances of a loan and the underlying collateral. If additional information reflects increased recovery of our investment, we will adjust our reserves accordingly. There were no loan reserves recorded during years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.\nDebt and preferred equity investments held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair market value using available market information obtained through consultation with dealers or other originators of such investments as well as discounted cash flow models based on Level 3 data pursuant to ASC 820-10. As circumstances change, management may conclude not to sell an investment designated as held for sale. In such situations, the investment will be reclassified at its net carrying value to debt and preferred equity investments held to maturity. For these reclassified investments, the difference between the current carrying value and the expected cash to be collected at maturity will be accreted into income over the remaining term of the investment.\nDerivative Instruments\nIn the normal course of business, we use a variety of commonly used derivative instruments, such as interest rate swaps, caps, collars and floors, to manage, or hedge, interest rate risk. Effectiveness is essential for those derivatives that we intend to qualify for hedge accounting. Some derivative instruments are associated with an anticipated transaction. In those cases, hedge effectiveness criteria also require that it be probable that the underlying transaction occurs. Instruments that meet these hedging criteria are formally designated as hedges at the inception of the derivative contract.\nTo determine the fair values of derivative instruments, we use a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date. For the majority of financial instruments including most derivatives, long-term investments and long-term debt, standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models, replacement cost, and termination cost are used to determine fair value. All methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2016 to the year ended December 31, 2015\nThe following comparison for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 2016, to the year ended December 31, 2015, or 2015, makes reference to the following: (i) the effect of the Same-Store Properties,\u201d which represents all operating properties owned by us at January 1, 2015 and still owned by us in the same manner at December 31, 2016 (Same-Store Properties totaled 55 of our 68 consolidated operating properties, representing 75.7% of our share of annualized cash rent), (ii) the effect of the Acquisition Properties,\u201d which represents all properties or interests in properties acquired in 2016 and 2015 and all non-Same-Store Properties, including properties that are under development, redevelopment or deconsolidated during the period, and (iii) Other,\u201d which represents corporate level items not allocable to specific properties, as well as the Service Corporation and eEmerge Inc.

properties acquired ($98.2 million), which included the acquisition of 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2015 together with the subsequent sale of a 40% interest in 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2016 ($59.2 million), the consolidation of 600 Lexington Avenue in the fourth quarter of 2015 ($19.3 million), and an increase in rents at our Same-Store Properties ($19.1 million). In addition, rental revenues increased as a result of the accelerated recognition\nof non-cash deferred income from 388-390 Greenwich Street as a result of Citigroup, Inc. (\"Citi\") exercising its option to purchase the property and entering into an agreement to accelerate the sale ($37.1 million). This increase was partially offset by the sale of 120 West 45th Street in the third quarter of 2015 ($18.3 million), the sale of 885 Third Avenue in the first quarter of 2016 ($11.9 million), as well as accounting write-offs ($17.4 million) and decreased cash revenue ($2.0 million) related to the space previously leased to Aeropostale at 1515 Broadway following the tenant's bankruptcy.\nEscalation and reimbursement revenue increased primarily as a result of higher real estate tax recoveries at the Same-Store Properties ($14.9 million) and Acquisition Properties ($7.6 million) attributable to an increase in the related tax expense. This was partially offset by decreased real estate tax recoveries due to the sale of 120 West 45th Street ($2.3 million), and 140 Grand Street ($1.3 million).\nOccupancy in our Same-Store Manhattan consolidated office operating portfolio, excluding leases signed but not yet commenced was 95.9% at December 31, 2016 as compared to 96.5% at December 31, 2015. Occupancy for our Same-Store Suburban consolidated office operating portfolio, excluding leases signed but not yet commenced, increased to 84.4% at December 31, 2016 as compared to 81.4% at December

Based on our estimates at December 31, 2016, the current market asking rents on these expected 2017 lease expirations at our consolidated Manhattan operating properties are 6.6% higher than the existing in-place fully escalated rents while the current market asking rents on all of our consolidated Manhattan operating properties are 10.2% higher than the existing in-place fully escalated rents on leases that are scheduled to expire in all future years. Based on our estimates at December 31, 2016, the current market asking rents on these expected 2016 lease expirations at our consolidated Suburban operating properties are 0.2% higher than the existing in-place fully escalated rents while the current market asking rents on all of our consolidated Suburban operating properties are 6.0% higher than the existing in-place fully escalated rents on leases that are scheduled to expire in all future years.\nInvestment Income\nInvestment income increased primarily as a result of additional income recognized from the recapitalization of a debt investment ($41.0 million). This increase was partially offset by a lower weighted average yield and balance for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the weighted average debt and preferred equity investment balance outstanding and weighted average yield were $1.5 billion and 9.7%, respectively, compared to $1.7 billion and 10.3%, respectively, for the same period in 2015. As of December 31, 2016, the debt and preferred equity investments had a fully extended weighted average term to maturity of 3.0 years.\nOther Income\nOther income increased primarily as a result of the lease termination fee earned in connection with the termination of the lease with Citigroup, Inc. at 388-390 Greenwich Avenue ($94.0 million), and promote income earned in connection with the sale of 33 Beekman ($10.8 million), which was partially offset by a lease termination fee received at 919 Third Avenue in 2015 ($11.3 million).\nProperty Operating Expenses\nProperty operating expenses increased primarily as a result of properties acquired ($25.9 million), which includes the acquisition 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2015 together with the subsequent sale of a 40% interest in 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2016 ($9.9 million), the consolidation of 600 Lexington Avenue ($8.6 million) in the fourth quarter if 2015, and higher operating expenses at the Same-Store Properties ($15.5 million) primarily driven by real estate taxes ($13.5 million). These increases were partially offset by a decrease in expenses stemming from our sold properties ($17.7 million), which included the sale of 120 West 45th St in the third quarter of 2015 ($9.8 million).\nMarketing, General and Administrative Expenses\nMarketing, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $99.8 million, or 4.7% of total combined revenues, including our share of joint venture revenues, and 53 basis points of total combined assets, including our share of joint venture assets compared to $94.9 million, or 5.0% of total revenues including our share of joint venture revenues, and 44 basis points of total combined assets including our share of joint venture assets for 2015.\nInterest Expense and Amortization of Deferred Financing Costs, Net of Interest Income\nInterest expense, net of interest income, decreased primarily as a result of the sale of 388-390 Greenwich Street in the second quarter of 2016 ($16.5 million), and the sale of 120 West 45th Street in the fourth quarter of 2015 ($7.7 million). These decreases were partially offset by the mortgage related to the acquisition of 11 Madison Avenue in the third quarter of 2015 ($20.8 million). The weighted average consolidated debt balance outstanding increased to $9.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $9.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. The weighted average interest rate was 3.87% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 3.78% for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization increased primarily as a result of the accelerated depreciation expense related to 388-390 Greenwich Street as a result of Citi exercising its option to purchase the property and entering into an agreement to accelerate the sale ($329.7 million). The increase is also driven by the acquisition of 100% interest of 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2015 together with the subsequent sale of a 40% interest in 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2016 ($52.5 million). These increases were partially offset by the accelerated depreciation in 2015 related to vacating the properties that comprise the One Vanderbilt development site ($146.6 million).\nEquity in Net Income in Unconsolidated Joint Venture/Real Estate\nEquity in net income from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased primarily as a result of the sale of a 40% interest in 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2016. The sale did not meet the criteria for sale accounting until December 2016 resulting in recognition of the other partner's share of depreciation ($8.4 million) in addition to our share of the operations of the property. The decrease was partially offset by an increase at 1552-1560 Broadway ($4.6 million) as a result of the settlement in February 2016 of arbitration regarding a tenant's rent at the property and revenue from a debt and preferred equity investment that was contributed to a joint venture in the first quarter of 2016 ($4.5 million), and from the increase at 650 Fifth Avenue as a result of the loan refinance in the third quarter of 2016 ($3.5 million).\nEquity in Net Gain on Sale of Interest in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016 we recognized a gain on the sale of 33 Beekman Street ($33.0 million), 7 Renaissance Square ($4.2 million), 1 Jericho ($3.3 million) and EOP Denver ($3.1 million), compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, in which we recognized a gain on sale associated with the sale of our joint venture interest at 315 West 36th Street ($16.3 million), partially offset by a loss on the sale of our joint venture interest at the Meadows ($1.6 million).\nPurchase Price Fair Value Adjustment\nThe purchase price fair value adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2015 was attributable to the acquisition of our joint venture partner's interest in 600 Lexington Avenue.\nGain on Sale of Real Estate\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a gain on sale associated with the sales of 388-390 Greenwich ($206.4 million), a 49% interest in 400 East 57th Street ($23.9 million), 248-252 Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn, New York ($15.3 million), and a 40% interest in 11 Madison Avenue ($3.6 million), partially offset by the loss on the sale of 7 International Drive, Westchester County, NY ($6.9 million). During the year ended December 31, 2015 we recognized a gain on sale associated with the sales of an 80% interest in 131-137 Spring Street ($101.1 million), 120 West 45th Street ($58.6 million), 570 & 574 Fifth Avenue ($24.6 million), partially offset by a loss on the sale of 885 Third Avenue ($6.6 million).\nDepreciable Real Estate Reserves\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized depreciable real estate reserves related to the sale of 500 West Putnam ($10.4 million), as compared to the same period in 2015 when we recognized depreciable real estate reserves related to the sale of two properties ($19.2 million).\nDiscontinued Operations\nDiscontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes the gain recognized on the sale of 180 Maiden Lane ($17.0 million) and the related results of operations. The Company adopted ASU 2014-08 effective January 1, 2015 which raised the threshold for disposals to qualify as discontinued operations to dispositions which represent a strategic shift in an entity's operations. The guidance was applied prospectively for new disposals. As a result, the results of operations for 388-390 Greenwich Street, which was classified as held for sale at March 31, 2016, 500 West Putnam Avenue, which was classified as held for sale at June 30, 2016 and 400 East 57th Street which was held for sale at September 30, 2016, are included in continuing operations for year ended December 31, 2016.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2014\nThe following comparison for the year ended December 31, 2015, or 2015, to the year ended December 31, 2014, or 2014, makes reference to the following: (i) the effect of the Same-Store Properties,\u201d which represents all operating properties owned by us at January 1, 2014 and still owned by us in the same manner at December 31, 2015 (Same-Store Properties totaled 54 of our 75 consolidated operating properties, representing 69.5% of our share of annualized cash rent), (ii) the effect of the Acquisition Properties,\u201d which represents all properties or interests in properties acquired in 2015 and 2014 and all non-Same-Store Properties, including properties that are under development, redevelopment or deconsolidated during the period, and (iii) Other,\u201d which represents corporate level items not allocable to specific properties, as well as the Service Corporation and eEmerge Inc.

properties acquired ($107.0 million), which included the consolidation of 388-390 Greenwich Street ($58.1 million), as discussed below, and the acquisition of 11 Madison Avenue ($33.9 million), an increase in occupancy at our Same-Store Properties ($33.8 million) and an increase in occupancy at two properties that were placed\ninto service ($9.2 million). This increase was partially offset by vacating the properties that comprise the One Vanderbilt development site ($16.6 million).\nIn May 2014, we acquired our joint venture partner's interest in 388-390 Greenwich Street thereby assuming full ownership of this triple net lease property. As a result of this acquisition, we consolidated the results of operations of this property beginning in May 2014. Prior to May 2014, we accounted for our investments in 388-390 Greenwich Street under the equity method of accounting. In January 2016, Citigroup, Inc. exercised its option to purchase 388-390 Greenwich Street for $2.0 billion, net of any unfunded tenant concessions. The closing occurred in June 2016.\nEscalation and reimbursement revenue increased primarily as a result of higher real estate tax recoveries ($10.8 million) at the Same-Store Properties attributable to an increase in the related real estate tax expense and properties recently acquired ($6.5 million), partially offset by vacating the properties that comprise the One Vanderbilt development site ($3.0 million).\nOccupancy in our Same-Store Manhattan consolidated office operating portfolio, excluding leases signed but not yet commenced, increased to 96.5% at December 31, 2015 as compared to 94.8% at December 31, 2014. Occupancy for our Same-Store Suburban consolidated office operating portfolio, excluding leases signed but not yet commenced, increased to 80.6% at December 31, 2015 as compared to 80.1% at December

Based on our estimates at December 31, 2015, the current market asking rents on these expected 2016 lease expirations at our consolidated Manhattan operating properties are 14.1% higher than the existing in-place fully escalated rents while the current market asking rents on all of our consolidated Manhattan operating properties are 16.3% higher than the existing in-place fully escalated rents on leases that are scheduled to expire in all future years. Based on our estimates at December 31, 2015, the current market asking rents on these expected 2016 lease expirations at our consolidated Suburban operating properties are 8.7% higher than the existing in-place fully escalated rents while the current market asking rents on all of our consolidated Suburban operating properties are 7.4% higher than the existing in-place fully escalated rents on leases that are scheduled to expire in all future years.\nInvestment Income\nInvestment income increased primarily as a result of higher average investment balances for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, the weighted average debt and preferred equity investment balance outstanding and weighted average yield were $1.7 billion and 10.3%, respectively, compared to $1.4 billion and 10.5%, respectively, for the same period in 2014. In addition, we recognized additional income as a result of the early repayment of certain mortgage and mezzanine positions ($2.5 million) and the sale of a junior mortgage position ($1.2 million). This increase was partially offset by additional income recognized in 2014 on a mezzanine investment for which the underlying property was sold in June 2014 ($10.1 million) and a financing receivable on which we began accruing interest following the completion of the development of the underlying property ($5.3 million). As of December 31, 2015, the debt and preferred equity investments had a weighted average term to maturity of 1.7 years as compared to a weighted average term to maturity of 2.0 years as of December 31, 2014.\nOther Income\nOther income increased primarily as a result of lease termination income earned at our same-store properties ($20.2 million), which included 919 Third Avenue ($12.5 million), a non-recurring fee related to the settlement of a previous investment ($6.5 million), a tax benefit related to our taxable REIT subsidiary ($5.3 million), a non-recurring fee received from a current tenant ($3.5 million), and a bankruptcy settlement received from a former tenant ($2.7 million). This increase was partially offset by promote income earned in 2014 in connection with the sale of our joint venture interest in 747 Madison Avenue and 180 Broadway in 2014 ($13.6 million), incentive income received from a joint venture investment in 2014 ($7.6 million), lower contributions from Service Corporation ($8.0 million) and a one-time fee earned in connection with the restructuring of one of our debt investments in 2014 ($5.7 million).\nProperty Operating Expenses\nProperty operating expenses increased primarily as a result of higher operating expenses at the Same-Store Properties ($28.3 million) and properties recently acquired ($14.4 million), partially offset by a decrease from vacating the properties that comprise the One Vanderbilt development site ($9.0 million). The increase in property operating expenses at the Same-Store Properties was primarily attributable to higher real estate taxes ($15.7 million), repairs and maintenance ($12.0 million) and professional fees ($2.2 million).\nMarketing, General and Administrative Expenses\nMarketing, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $94.9 million, or 5.0% of total combined revenues, including our share of joint venture revenues, and 44 basis points of total combined assets, including our share of joint venture assets compared to $92.5 million, or 5.3% of total revenues including our share of joint venture revenues, and 49 basis points of total assets including our share of joint venture assets for 2014.\nInterest Expense and Amortization of Deferred Financing Costs, Net of Interest Income\nInterest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, net of interest income, increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of our joint venture partner's interest in May 2014 and a new mortgage at 388-390 Greenwich Street ($16.4 million), increased borrowings on the 2012 credit facility ($10.9 million), and a mortgage related to the acquisition of 11 Madison Avenue ($12.8 million). These increases were partially offset by the repayment of the mortgages at 625 Madison Avenue ($8.4 million) and 125 Park Avenue ($4.3 million) during the fourth quarter of 2014 and 711 Third ($4.8 million) during the first quarter of 2015, the capitalization of interest relating to properties under development ($4.4 million), the redemption of a preferred equity investment which secured a loan ($3.1 million) during the fourth quarter of 2014, and the repayment of 5.875% senior notes issued by ROP in August 2014 ($2.8 million) at their maturity. The weighted average consolidated debt balance outstanding increased to $9.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $8.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014. The weighted average interest rate decreased to 3.78% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 4.24% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization increased primarily as a result of accelerated depreciation expense related to vacating the properties that comprise the One Vanderbilt development site ($138.1 million), the consolidation of 388-390 Greenwich Street in 2014 ($31.2 million), and the acquisition of 11 Madison in August 2015 ($11.1 million), partially offset by the write-off of certain tenant improvements and value for in-place leases associated with a former tenant in 2014 ($3.4 million).\nEquity in Net Income in Unconsolidated Joint Venture/Real Estate\nEquity in net income from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased primarily as a result of lower net income contributions from 388-390 Greenwich ($7.6 million) as a result of our acquisition of our joint venture partner's interest in May 2014, the refinancing and early prepayment of the debt encumbering 3 Columbus Circle in the first quarter of 2015 ($3.6 million), an increase in net loss recognized as a result of the acquisition of additional interests in 1745 Broadway in the fourth quarter of 2014 ($2.3 million), a decrease in the capitalization of costs for 280 Park Avenue ($1.9 million), and the disposition of 180 Broadway in\nSeptember 2014 ($1.6 million). This decrease was partially offset by higher contributions from debt and preferred equity investments that were originated during 2014 and have been accounted for as equity investments ($3.3 million), the net loss recognized in 2014 from the West Coast portfolio ($2.4 million), the refinancing and early prepayment in 2014 of the debt encumbering 100 Park Avenue ($2.0 million) and an increase in occupancy at 600 Lexington Avenue ($1.2 million).\nEquity in Net Gain on Sale of Interest in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized a gain on sale associated with the sale of our joint venture interest at 315 West 36th Street ($16.3 million), partially offset by a loss on the sale of our joint venture interest at the Meadows ($1.6 million). During the year ended December 31, 2014 we recognized gains on the sale of a portfolio of office properties primarily in Southern California, or the \"West Coast portfolio\" ($85.6 million), the sale of partnership interests in 21 West 34th Street ($20.9 million), the sale of the joint venture property at 180 Broadway ($16.5 million) and the sale of condominium units at 248 Bedford Avenue, Brooklyn ($1.5 million).\nPurchase Price Fair Value Adjustment\nThe purchase price fair value adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2015 was attributable to the acquisition of our joint venture partner's interest in 600 Lexington Avenue. The purchase price fair value adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2014 was attributable to the acquisition of our joint venture partner's interest in 388-390 Greenwich Street.\nGain on Sale of Real Estate\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized a gain on sale associated with the sales of 120 West 45th Street ($58.6 million), 570 & 574 Fifth Avenue ($24.6 million), an 80% interest in 131-137 Spring Street ($101.1 million), and a loss on the sale of 885 Third Avenue ($6.6 million).\nDepreciable Real Estate Reserves\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a $19.2 million charge in connection with the sale of 140-150 Grand Street.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily attributable to the refinancing of the mortgage at 420 Lexington Avenue ($24.5 million) and the early repayment of the mortgage at 625 Madison Avenue ($6.9 million).\nDiscontinued Operations\nDiscontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 included the gain recognized on the sale of 180 Maiden Lane ($17.0 million) and the related results of operations. Discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 included the gains recognized on the sale of 673 First Avenue ($117.6 million), 985-987 Third Avenue ($29.8 million), and 2 Herald Square ($18.8 million), and the results of operations of these properties and other properties that were held for sale or sold as of December 31, 2014.\nReconciliation of Same-Store Operating Income to Net Operating Income\nWe present Same-Store net operating income, or Same-Store NOI, because we believe that this measure provides investors with useful information regarding the operating performance of properties that are comparable for the years presented. We determine Same-Store net operating income by subtracting Same-Store property operating expenses and ground rent from Same-Store rental revenues and other income. Our method of calculation may be different from methods used by other REITs, and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. Same-Store NOI is not an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) and Same-Store performance should not be considered an alternative to GAAP net income performance.\nComparison

We expect to generate positive cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future. We may seek to divest of properties or interests in properties or access private and public debt and equity capital when the opportunity presents itself, although there is no guarantee that this capital will be made available to us at efficient levels or at all. Management believes that these sources of liquidity, if we are able to access them, along with potential refinancing opportunities for secured debt, will allow us to satisfy our debt obligations, as described above, upon maturity, if not before.\nWe also have investments in several real estate joint ventures with various partners who we consider to be financially stable and who have the ability to fund a capital call when needed. Most of our joint ventures are financed with non-recourse debt. We believe that property level cash flows along with unfunded committed indebtedness and proceeds from the refinancing of outstanding secured indebtedness will be sufficient to fund the capital needs of our joint venture properties.\nCash Flows\nThe following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on our consolidated statements of cash flows in \"Item 1. Financial Statements\" and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the years presented below.\nCash and cash equivalents were $279.4 million and $255.4 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing a increase of $24.0 million.

Our debt and preferred equity and joint venture investments also provide a steady stream of operating cash flow to us.\nCash is used in investing activities to fund acquisitions, development or redevelopment projects and recurring and nonrecurring capital expenditures. We selectively invest in new projects that enable us to take advantage of our development, leasing, financing and property management skills and invest in existing buildings that meet our investment criteria.

The 2010 Long-Term Compensation Plan is a long-term incentive compensation plan pursuant to which award recipients could earn, in the aggregate, from $15.0 million up to $75.0 million of LTIP Units in the Operating Partnership based on the Company's stock price appreciation over three years beginning on December 1, 2009; provided that, if maximum performance had been achieved, $25.0 million of awards could be earned at any time after the beginning of the second year and an additional $25.0 million of awards could be earned at any time after the beginning of the third year. In order to achieve maximum performance under the 2010 Long-Term Compensation Plan, the Company's aggregate stock price appreciation during the performance period had to equal or exceed 50%. The compensation committee determined that maximum performance had been achieved at or shortly after the beginning of each of the second and third years of the performance period and for the full performance period and, accordingly, 385,583 LTIP Units, 327,416 LTIP Units and 327,416 LTIP Units were earned under the 2010 Long-Term Compensation Plan in December 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. Substantially in accordance with the original terms of the program, 50% of these LTIP Units vested on December 17, 2012 (accelerated from the original January 1, 2013 vesting date), 25% of these LTIP Units vested on December 11, 2013 (accelerated from the original January 1, 2014 vesting date) and the remainder vested on January 1, 2015 based on continued employment. In accordance with the terms of the 2010 Long-Term Compensation Plan, distributions were not paid on any LTIP Units until they were earned, at which time we paid all distributions that would have been paid on the earned LTIP Units since the beginning of the performance period.\nThe cost of the 2010 Long-Term Compensation Plan ($31.7 million, subject to forfeitures) was amortized into earnings through the final vesting period of January 1, 2015. We recorded compensation expense of $2.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 related to the 2010 Long-Term Compensation Plan.\n2011 Outperformance Plan\nIn August 2011, the compensation committee of the Company's board of directors approved the general terms of the SL Green Realty Corp. 2011 Outperformance Plan, or the 2011 Outperformance Plan. Participants in the 2011 Outperformance Plan could earn, in the aggregate, up to $85.0 million of LTIP Units in the Operating Partnership based on our total return to stockholders for the three-year period beginning September 1, 2011. Under the 2011 Outperformance Plan, participants were entitled to share in a \"performance pool\" comprised of LTIP Units with a value equal to 10% of the amount by which our total return to stockholders during the three-year period exceeded a cumulative total return to stockholders of 25%, subject to the maximum of $85.0 million of LTIP Units; provided that if maximum performance was achieved, one-third of each award could be earned at any time after the beginning of the second year and an additional one-third of each award could be earned at any time after the beginning of the third year. LTIP Units earned under the 2011 Outperformance Plan are subject to continued vesting requirements, with 50% of any awards earned vested on August 31, 2014 and the remaining 50% vesting on August 31, 2015, subject to continued employment with us through such dates. Participants were not entitled to distributions with respect to LTIP Units granted under the 2011 Outperformance Plan unless and until they were earned. For LTIP Units that were earned, each participant was also entitled to the distributions that would have been paid had the number of earned LTIP Units been issued at the beginning of the performance period, with such distributions being paid in the form of additional LTIP Units. Thereafter, distributions are to be paid currently with respect to all earned LTIP Units, whether vested or unvested. In June 2014, the compensation committee determined that maximum performance had been achieved during the third year of the performance period and, accordingly, 560,908 LTIP Units, representing two-thirds of each award, were earned, subject to vesting, under the 2011 Outperformance Plan. In September 2014, the compensation committee determined that maximum performance had been achieved for the full three-year performance period and, accordingly, 280,454 LTIP units, representing the final third of each award, were earned, subject to vesting, under the 2011 Outperformance Plan.\nThe cost of the 2011 Outperformance Plan ($26.7 million, subject to forfeitures) was amortized into earnings through the final vesting period. We recorded no compensation expense during the year ended December 31, 2016, and recorded compensation expense of $4.5 million, and $8.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to the 2011 Outperformance Plan.\n2014 Outperformance Plan\nIn August 2014, the compensation committee of the Company's board of directors approved the general terms of the SL Green Realty Corp. 2014 Outperformance Plan, or the 2014 Outperformance Plan. Participants in the 2014 Outperformance Plan may earn, in the aggregate, up to 610,000 LTIP Units in our Operating Partnership based on our total return to stockholders for the three-year period beginning September 1, 2014. Under the 2014 Outperformance Plan, two-thirds of the LTIP Units may be earned based on the Company's absolute total return to stockholders and one-third of the LTIP Units may be earned based on relative total return to stockholders compared to the constituents of the MSCI REIT Index. Awards earned based on absolute total return to stockholders will be determined independently of awards earned based on relative total return to stockholders. In the event the Company's performance reaches either threshold before the end of the three-year performance period, a pro-rata portion of the maximum award may be earned. For each component, if the Company's performance reaches the maximum threshold beginning with the 19th month of the performance period, participants will earn one-third of the maximum award that may be earned for that component. If the Company's performance reaches the maximum threshold during the third year of the performance period for a component, participants will earn two-thirds (or an additional one-third) of the maximum award that may be earned for that component. LTIP Units earned under the 2014 Outperformance Plan will be subject to continued vesting requirements, with 50% of any awards earned vesting on August 31, 2017 and the remaining 50% vesting on August 31, 2018, subject to continued employment with us through such dates. Participants will not be entitled to distributions with respect to LTIP Units granted under the 2014 Outperformance Plan unless and until they are earned. If LTIP Units are earned, each participant will also be entitled to the distributions that would have been paid had the number of earned LTIP Units been issued at the beginning of the performance period, with such distributions being paid in the form of cash or additional LTIP Units. Thereafter, distributions will be paid currently with respect to all earned LTIP Units, whether vested or unvested.\nThe cost of the 2014 Outperformance Plan ($27.9 million, subject to forfeitures), based on the portion of the 2014 Outperformance Plan granted as of December 31, 2016, will be amortized into earnings through the final vesting period. We recorded compensation expense of $8.4 million, $5.9 million and $0.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, related to the 2014 Outperformance Plan.\nDeferred Compensation Plan for Directors\nUnder our Non-Employee Director's Deferral Program, which commenced July 2004, the Company's non-employee directors may elect to defer up to 100% of their annual retainer fee, chairman fees, meeting fees and annual stock grant. Unless otherwise elected by a participant, fees deferred under the program shall be credited in the form of phantom stock units. The program provides that a director's phantom stock units generally will be settled in an equal number of shares of common stock upon the earlier of (i) the January 1 coincident with or the next following such director's termination of service from the Board of Directors or (ii) a change in control by us, as defined by the program. Phantom stock units are credited to each non-employee director quarterly using the closing price of SL Green's common stock on the first business day of the respective quarter. Each participating non-employee director is also credited with dividend equivalents or phantom stock units based on the dividend rate for each quarter, which are either paid in cash currently or credited to the director's account as additional phantom stock units.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, 9,022 phantom stock units were earned and 9,279 shares of common stock were issued to our board of directors. We recorded compensation expense of $2.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 related to the Deferred Compensation Plan. As of December 31, 2016, there were 89,790 phantom stock units outstanding pursuant to our Non-Employee Director's Deferral Program.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn 2007, the Company's board of directors adopted the 2008 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, to encourage our employees to increase their efforts to make our business more successful by providing equity-based incentives to eligible employees. The ESPP is intended to qualify as an \"employee stock purchase plan\" under Section 423 of the Code, and has been adopted by the board to enable our eligible employees to purchase the Company's shares of common stock through payroll deductions. The ESPP became effective on January 1, 2008 with a maximum of 500,000 shares of the common stock available for issuance, subject to adjustment upon a merger, reorganization, stock split or other similar corporate change. The Company filed a registration statement on Form S-8 with the SEC with respect to the ESPP. The common stock is offered for purchase through a series of successive offering periods. Each offering period will be three months in duration and will begin on the first day of each calendar quarter, with the first offering period having commenced on January 1, 2008. The ESPP provides for eligible employees to purchase the common stock at a purchase price equal to 85% of the lesser of (1) the market value of the common stock on the first day of the offering period or (2) the market value of the common stock on the last day of the offering period. The ESPP was approved by our stockholders at our 2008 annual meeting of stockholders. As of December 31, 2016, 95,448 shares of SL Green's common stock had been issued under the ESPP.\nMarket Capitalization\nAt December 31, 2016, borrowings under our mortgages and other loans payable, 2012 credit facility, senior unsecured notes, trust preferred securities and our share of joint venture debt represented 43.3% of our combined market capitalization of $20.8 billion (based on a common stock price of $107.55 per share, the closing price of SL Green's common stock on the NYSE on December 31, 2016). Market capitalization includes our consolidated debt, common and preferred stock and the conversion of all units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, and our share of joint venture debt.\nIndebtedness\nThe table below summarizes our consolidated mortgages and other loans payable, 2012 credit facility, senior unsecured notes and trust preferred securities outstanding at December 31, 2016 and 2015, (amounts in thousands).\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt Summary:\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed rate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,094,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,190,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Variable rate-hedged\n</td> <td>1,357,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,041,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total fixed rate\n</td> <td>5,452,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,232,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total variable rate\n</td> <td>1,105,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,202,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,557,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,434,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt, preferred equity, and other investments subject to variable rate\n</td> <td>1,359,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,178,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net exposure to variable rate debt\n</td> <td>(254,159\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,023,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent of Total Debt:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed rate\n</td> <td>83.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Variable rate\n</td> <td>16.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective Interest Rate for the Year:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed rate\n</td> <td>4.35\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.63\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Variable rate\n</td> <td>2.10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.74\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective interest rate\n</td> <td>3.82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.78\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe variable rate debt shown above generally bears interest at an interest rate based on 30-day LIBOR (0.77% and 0.43% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively). Our consolidated debt at December 31, 2016 had a weighted average term to maturity of 4.28 years.\nCertain of our debt and equity investments and other investments, with a carrying value of $1.4 billion at December 31, 2016, are variable rate investments which mitigate our exposure to interest rate changes on our unhedged variable rate debt.\nMortgage Financing\nAs of December 31, 2016, our total mortgage debt (excluding our share of joint venture mortgage debt of $2.7 billion) consisted of $3.5 billion of fixed rate debt, including swapped variable rate debt, with an effective weighted average interest rate of 4.68% and $0.6 billion of variable rate debt with an effective weighted average interest rate of 2.83%.\nCorporate Indebtedness\n2012 Credit Facility\nIn August 2016, we entered into an amendment to the credit facility that was originally entered into by the Company in November 2012, referred to as the 2012 credit facility. As of December 31, 2016, the 2012 credit facility, as amended, consisted of a $1.6 billion revolving credit facility and a $1.2 billion term loan, with a maturity date of March 29, 2019 and June 30, 2019, respectively. The revolving credit facility has an as-of-right extension to March 29, 2020. We also have an option, subject to customary conditions, to increase the capacity under the revolving credit facility to $3.0 billion at any time prior to the maturity date for the revolving credit facility without the consent of existing lenders, by obtaining additional commitments from our existing lenders and other financial institutions.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the 2012 credit facility bore interest at a spread over LIBOR ranging from (i) 87.5 basis points to 155 basis points for loans under the revolving credit facility and (ii) 95 basis points to 190 basis points for loans under the term loan facility, in each case based on the credit rating assigned to the senior unsecured long term indebtedness of ROP.\nAt December 31, 2016, the applicable spread was 125 basis points for the revolving credit facility and 140 basis points for the term loan facility. At December 31, 2016, the effective interest rate was 1.78% for the revolving credit facility and 2.27% for the term loan facility. We are required to pay quarterly in arrears a 12.5 to 30 basis point facility fee on the total commitments under the revolving credit facility based on the credit rating assigned to the senior unsecured long term indebtedness of ROP. As of December 31, 2016, the facility fee was 25 basis points.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $56.5 million of outstanding letters of credit, 0 drawn under the revolving credit facility and $1.2 billion outstanding under the term loan facility, with total undrawn capacity of $1.5 billion under the 2012 credit facility. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the revolving credit facility had a carrying value of $(6.3) million, representing deferred financing costs presented within other liabilities, and $985.1 million, respectively, net of deferred financing costs. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the term loan facility had a carrying value of $1.2 billion and $929.5 million, respectively, net of deferred financing costs.\nThe Company, the Operating Partnership and ROP are all borrowers jointly and severally obligated under the 2012 credit facility. None of our other subsidiaries are obligors under the 2012 credit facility.\nThe 2012 credit facility includes certain restrictions and covenants (see Restrictive Covenants below).\nFederal Home Loan Bank of New York Facility\nThe Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Belmont Insurance Company, or Belmont, a New York licensed captive insurance company, is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, or FHLBNY. As a member, Belmont may borrow funds from the FHLBNY in the form of secured advances. As of December 31, 2016, we had $205.0 million in outstanding secured advances with a weighted average borrowing rate of 0.92%.\nOn January 12, 2016, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, or FHFA, adopted a final regulation on Federal Home Loan Bank, or FHLB, membership. The rule excludes captive insurance entities from FHLB membership on a going-forward basis and provides termination rules for current captive insurance members. Belmont's membership was terminated on February 20, 2017. All funds borrowed from the FHLBNY were repaid in January 2017.\nMaster Repurchase Agreement\nIn July, 2016 we entered into a restated Master Repurchase Agreement, or MRA, which provides us with the ability to sell certain debt investments with a simultaneous agreement to repurchase the same at a certain date or on demand. The MRA has a maximum facility capacity of $300.0 million and bears interest ranging from 225 and 400 basis points over 30-day LIBOR depending on the pledged collateral. Since December 6, 2015, we have been required to pay monthly in arrears a 25 basis point fee on the excess of $150.0 million over the average daily balance during the period if the average daily balance is less than $150.0 million. We seek to mitigate risks associated with our repurchase agreement by managing the credit quality of our assets, early repayments, interest rate volatility, liquidity, and market value. The margin call provisions under our repurchase facility permit valuation adjustments based on capital markets activity, and are not limited to collateral-specific credit marks. To monitor credit risk associated with our debt investments, our asset management team regularly reviews our investment portfolio and is in contact with our borrowers in order to monitor the collateral and enforce our rights as necessary. The risk associated with potential margin calls is further mitigated by our ability to recollateralize the facility with additional assets from our portfolio of debt investments, our ability to satisfy margin calls with cash or cash equivalents and our access to additional liquidity through the 2012 credit facility, as defined below.\nAt December 31, 2016 and 2015, the gross book value of the properties and debt and preferred equity investments collateralizing the mortgages and other loans payable, not including assets held for sale, was approximately $6.0 billion and $10.8 billion, respectively.\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nThe following table sets forth our senior unsecured notes and other related disclosures as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, by scheduled maturity date (dollars in thousands):\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Issuance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\nUnpaid\nPrincipal\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\nAccreted\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\nAccreted\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Coupon\nRate (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effective\nRate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Term\n(in Years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maturity Date\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>October 12, 2010 (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>345,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>334,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>321,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>August 5, 2011 (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>249,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>249,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 16, 2010 (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>November 15, 2012 (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 2022\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 17, 2015 (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 2025\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 26, 2007 (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2006 (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>255,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,145,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,133,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,386,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred financing costs, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,642\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,280\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,145,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,128,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,378,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________________________________________________________\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Interest on the senior unsecured notes is payable semi-annually with principal and unpaid interest due on the scheduled maturity dates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Issued by the Operating Partnership. Interest on these exchangeable notes is payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15. The notes had an initial exchange rate representing an exchange price that was set at a 30.0% premium to the last reported sale price of SL Green's common stock on October 6, 2010, or $85.81. The initial exchange rate is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. The current exchange rate is 12.6478 shares of SL Green's common stock per $1,000 principal amount of these notes. The notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Operating Partnership and are exchangeable upon the occurrence of specified events and during the period beginning on the twenty-second scheduled trading day prior to the maturity date and ending on the second business day prior to the maturity date, into cash or a combination of cash and shares of SL Green's common stock, if any, at our option. As a result of meeting specified events (as defined in the Indenture Agreement), these notes became exchangeable commencing January 1, 2016 and will remain exchangeable through March 31, 2016. The notes are guaranteed by ROP. On the issuance date, $78.3 million of the debt balance was recorded in equity. As of December 31, 2016, $10.9 million remained to be amortized into the debt balance.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Issued by the Company, the Operating Partnership and ROP, as co-obligors.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(4)\n</td> <td>Balance was repaid in September 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(5)\n</td> <td>Issued by ROP, balance was repaid in March 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Restrictive Covenants\nThe terms of the 2012 credit facility, as amended, and certain of our senior unsecured notes include certain restrictions and covenants which may limit, among other things, our ability to pay dividends, make certain types of investments, incur additional indebtedness, incur liens and enter into negative pledge agreements and dispose of assets, and which require compliance with financial ratios relating to the maximum ratio of total indebtedness to total asset value, a minimum ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges, a maximum ratio of secured indebtedness to total asset value and a maximum ratio of unsecured indebtedness to unencumbered asset value. The dividend restriction referred to above provides that, we will not during any time when a default is continuing, make distributions with respect to common stock or other equity interests, except to enable the Company to continue to qualify as a REIT for Federal income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we were in compliance with all such covenants.\nJunior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures\nIn June 2005, the Company and the Operating Partnership issued $100.0 million in unsecured trust preferred securities through a newly formed trust, SL Green Capital Trust I, or the Trust, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership. The securities mature in 2035 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.61% for the first P10Y years ending July 2015. Thereafter, the interest rate will float at 125 basis points over the three-month LIBOR. Interest payments may be deferred for a period of up to eight consecutive quarters if the Operating Partnership exercises its right to defer such payments. The Trust preferred securities are redeemable at the option of the Operating Partnership, in whole or in part, with no prepayment premium. We do not consolidate the Trust even though it is a variable interest entity as we are not the primary beneficiary. Because the Trust is not consolidated, we have recorded the debt on our consolidated balance sheets and the related payments are classified as interest expense.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our variable rate debt. Our exposure to interest rate fluctuations are managed through either the use of interest rate derivatives instruments and/or through our variable rate debt and preferred equity investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates along the entire interest rate curve for 2016 would\ndecrease our annual interest cost, net of interest income from variable rate debt and preferred equity investments, by $2.4 million and would increase our share of joint venture annual interest cost by $11.6 million. This risk is partially mitigated by our floating rate debt investments. At December 31, 2016, 78.0% of our $1.6 billion debt and preferred equity portfolio is indexed to LIBOR.\nWe recognize most derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges are adjusted to fair value through income. If a derivative is considered a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged asset, liability, or firm commitment through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings.\nOur long-term debt of $5.5 billion bears interest at fixed rates, and therefore the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in the market interest rates. Our variable rate debt and variable rate joint venture debt as of December 31, 2016 bore interest based on a spread of LIBOR plus 140 basis points to LIBOR plus 417 basis points.\nContractual Obligations\nThe combined aggregate principal maturities of mortgages and other loans payable, the 2012 credit facility, senior unsecured notes (net of discount), trust preferred securities, our share of joint venture debt, including as-of-right extension options and put options, estimated interest expense, and our obligations under our capital lease and ground leases, as of December 31, 2016 are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

preferred equity investments. These investments all have varying ownership structures. Substantially all of our joint venture arrangements are accounted for under the equity method of accounting as we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the operating and financial decisions of these joint venture arrangements. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are discussed in Note 5, \"Debt and Preferred Equity Investments\" and Note 6, \"Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe estimate that for the year ending December 31, 2017, we expect to incur $120.1 million of recurring capital expenditures and $266.7 million of development or redevelopment expenditures, net of loan reserves, (including tenant improvements and leasing commissions) on existing consolidated properties, and our share of capital expenditures at our joint venture properties, net of loan reserves, will be $307.8 million. Future property acquisitions may require substantial capital investments for refurbishment and leasing costs. We expect to fund these capital expenditures with operating cash flow, existing liquidity, or incremental borrowings. We expect our capital needs over the next twelve months and thereafter will be met through a combination of cash on hand, net cash provided by operations, potential asset sales, borrowings or additional equity or debt issuances.\nDividends/Distributions\nWe expect to pay dividends to our stockholders based on the distributions we receive from our Operating Partnership primarily from property revenues net of operating expenses or, if necessary, from working capital.\nTo maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must pay annual dividends to our stockholders of at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined before taking into consideration the dividends paid deduction and net capital gains. We intend to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends to our stockholders. Based on our current annual dividend rate of $3.10 per share, we would pay $325.3 million in dividends to SL Green's common stockholders on an annual basis. Before we pay any dividend, whether for Federal income tax purposes or otherwise, which would only be paid out of available cash to the extent permitted under the 2012 credit facility and senior unsecured notes, we must first meet both our operating requirements and scheduled debt service on our mortgages and loans payable.\nRelated Party Transactions\nCleaning/ Security/ Messenger and Restoration Services\nAlliance Building Services, or Alliance, and its affiliates are partially owned by Gary Green, a son of Stephen L. Green, the chairman of SL Green's board of directors, and provide services to certain properties owned by us. Alliance's affiliates include First Quality Maintenance, L.P., or First Quality, Classic Security LLC, Bright Star Couriers LLC and Onyx Restoration Works, and provide cleaning, extermination, security, messenger, and restoration services, respectively. In addition, First Quality has the non-exclusive opportunity to provide cleaning and related services to individual tenants at our properties on a basis separately negotiated with any tenant seeking such additional services. The Service Corporation has entered into an arrangement with Alliance whereby it will receive a profit participation above a certain threshold for services provided by Alliance to certain tenants at certain buildings above the base services specified in their lease agreements.\nIncome earned from profit participation, which is included in other income on the consolidated statements of operations, was $3.5 million, $3.8 million, and $3.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We also recorded expenses of $23.4 million, $21.3 million, and $21.5 million the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for these services (excluding services provided directly to tenants).\nManagement Fees\nS.L. Green Management Corp., a consolidated entity, receives property management fees from an entity in which Stephen L. Green owns an interest. We received management fees from this entity of $0.7 million, $0.5 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 respectively.\nOne Vanderbilt Co-Investment\nIn December 2016, we entered into agreements with entities owned and controlled by Messrs. Holliday and Mathias, pursuant to which they agreed to make a co-investment with us in our One Vanderbilt development project. Pursuant to these agreements, Messrs. Holliday and Mathias agreed to purchase interests in the One Vanderbilt development project that will entitle them to receive approximately 2.50%-3.00% of the profit generated from this project in excess of capital contributions. 50% of these interests were purchased on December 31, 2016 and the remaining 50% are to be purchased on December 31, 2017. The aggregate purchase price for these interests is $2.4 million, which equals the fair market value of these interests as of the date the co-investment agreements were entered into as determined by an independent third party appraisal that we obtained.\nMessrs. Holliday and Mathias cannot monetize their interests until after stabilization of the property (50% within three years after stabilization and 100% three years or more after stabilization). In addition, the agreement calls for us to repurchase these interests in the event of a sale of One Vanderbilt or a transactional change of control of the Company. We also have the right to repurchase these interests on the seven-year anniversary of the stabilization of the project or upon the occurrence of certain separation events prior to the stabilization of the project relating to each of Messrs. Holliday's and Mathias's continued service with us. The price paid upon monetization of the interests will equal the liquidation value of the interests at the time, with the value of One Vanderbilt being based on its sale price, if applicable, or fair market value as determined by an independent third party appraiser.\nInsurance\nWe maintain all-risk\u201d property and rental value coverage (including coverage regarding the perils of flood, earthquake and terrorism, excluding nuclear, biological, chemical, and radiological terrorism (\"NBCR\")), within three property insurance programs and liability insurance. Management believes the policy specifications and insured limits are appropriate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage, and industry practice. Separate property and liability coverage may be purchased on a stand-alone basis for certain assets, such as the development of One Vanderbilt.\nOn January 12, 2015, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization and Extension Act of 2007 (\"TRIPRA\") (formerly the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act) was reauthorized until December 31, 2020 pursuant to the Terrorism Insurance Program Reauthorization and Extension Act of 2015. The TRIPRA extends the federal Terrorism Insurance Program that requires insurance companies to offer terrorism coverage and provides for compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of certified terrorism, subject to the current program trigger of $120.0 million, which will increase by $20.0 million per annum, commencing December 31,\n2015 (Trigger). Coinsurance under TRIPRA is 16%, increasing 1% per annum, as of December 31, 2015 (Coinsurance). There are no assurances TRIPRA will be further extended.\nOur wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiary, Belmont Insurance Company, or Belmont, acts as a captive insurance company and as one of the elements of our overall insurance program. Belmont was formed in an effort, among other reasons, to stabilize to some extent the impact of insurance market fluctuations. Belmont is licensed by New York State as a direct insurer of Terrorism and NBCR Terrorism, and a reinsurer with respect to portions of our General Liability, Environmental Liability, Flood, Professional Liability, Employment Practices Liability and D&O coverage. Belmont purchases reinsurance for its Coinsurance and is backstopped by the Federal government for the balance of its terrorism limit for certified acts of terrorism above the Trigger. We purchase direct, third party terrorism insurance up to the Trigger for certified acts of terrorism. Belmont is backstopped by the Federal government for certified acts of NBCR terrorism above the Trigger and subject to its Coinsurance, however does not reinsure its NBCR Coinsurance requirement. There is no coverage for a NBCR terrorism act if covered industry losses are below the Trigger. As long as we own Belmont, we are responsible for its liquidity and capital resources, and the accounts of Belmont are part of our consolidated financial statements. If we experience a loss and Belmont is required to pay a claim under our insurance policies, we would ultimately record the loss to the extent of Belmont's required payment. Therefore, certain insurance coverage provided by Belmont should not be considered as the equivalent of third-party insurance, but rather as a modified form of self-insurance.\nOur debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties (which are generally non-recourse to us), mezzanine loans, ground leases, our 2012 credit facility, senior unsecured notes and other corporate obligations, contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we currently maintain sufficient insurance coverage to satisfy these obligations, there is no assurance that in the future we will be able to procure coverage at a reasonable cost. In such instances, there can be no assurance that the lenders or ground lessors under these instruments will not take the position that a total or partial exclusion from all-risk\u201d insurance coverage for losses due to, for example, terrorist acts is a breach of these debt and ground lease instruments allowing the lenders or ground lessors to declare an event of default and accelerate repayment of debt or recapture of ground lease positions. In addition, if lenders require greater coverage that we are unable to obtain at commercially reasonable rates, we may incur substantially higher insurance premiums or our ability to finance our properties and expand our portfolio may be adversely impacted.\nFurthermore, with respect to certain of our properties, including properties held by joint ventures, or subject to triple net leases, insurance coverage is obtained by a third-party and we do not control the coverage. While we may have agreements with such third parties to maintain adequate coverage and we monitor these policies, such coverage ultimately may not be maintained or adequately cover our risk of loss. We may have less protection than with respect to the properties where we obtain coverage directly. Although we consider our insurance coverage to be appropriate, in the event of a major catastrophe, we may not have sufficient coverage to replace certain properties.\nFunds from Operations\nFunds from Operations, or FFO, is a widely recognized measure of REIT performance. We compute FFO in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, which may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not compute FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, or that interpret the NAREIT definition differently than we do. The revised White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in April 2002, and as subsequently amended, defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of properties and real estate related impairment charges, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. We present FFO because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, particularly those that own and operate commercial office properties.\nWe also use FFO as one of several criteria to determine performance-based bonuses for members of our senior management. FFO is intended to exclude GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets, which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time. Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions. Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate, gains and losses from property dispositions and extraordinary items, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indication of our financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions.\nFFO for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to SL Green common stockholders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>234,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>269,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>503,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>821,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>560,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>371,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discontinued operations depreciation adjustments\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Joint venture depreciation and noncontrolling interest adjustments\n</td> <td>69,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>17,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of real estate and discontinued operations\n</td> <td>238,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>190,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in net gain on sale of interest in unconsolidated joint venture/real estate\n</td> <td>44,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>123,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase price fair value adjustment\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciable real estate reserves\n</td> <td>(10,387\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19,226\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation on non-rental real estate assets\n</td> <td>2,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds from Operations attributable to SL Green common stockholders and noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>869,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>661,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>583,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>634,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>526,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>490,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows used in investing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,122,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,265,911\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(796,835\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,733,240\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,713,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>381,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInflation\nSubstantially all of our office leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense escalations as well as operating expense recoveries based on increases in the Consumer Price Index or other measures such as porters' wage. In addition, many of the leases provide for fixed base rent increases. We believe that inflationary increases will be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and expense escalations described above.\nAccounting Standards Updates\nThe Accounting Standards Updates are discussed in Note 2, \"Significant Accounting Policies - Accounting Standards Updates\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nForward-Looking Information\nThis report includes certain statements that may be deemed to be \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions thereof. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this report that address activities, events or developments that we expect, believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future, including such matters as future capital expenditures, dividends and acquisitions (including the amount and nature thereof), development trends of the real estate industry and the Manhattan, Brooklyn, Westchester County, Connecticut, Long Island and New Jersey office markets, business strategies, expansion and growth of our operations and other similar matters, are forward-looking statements.

Unless the context requires otherwise, all references to \"we,\" \"our\" and \"us\" means the Company and all entities owned or controlled by the Company, including the Operating Partnership.\nReckson Associates Realty Corp., or Reckson, and Reckson Operating Partnership, L.P. or ROP, are wholly-owned subsidiaries of the SL Green Realty Corp.\nThe following discussion related to our consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements appearing in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe New York City commercial real estate market remained strong in 2016, and we took advantage of this market in improving asking rents and strategically selling or forming joint venture properties at attractive market valuations.\nLeasing and Operating\nIn 2016, our same-store Manhattan office property occupancy based on leases signed was 97.1% compared to 97.2% in the prior year. We signed office leases in Manhattan encompassing approximately 3.2 million square feet, of which approximately 2.6 million square feet represented office leases that replaced previously occupied space. Our mark-to-market on these approximately 2.6 million square feet of signed Manhattan office leases that replaced previously occupied space was 27.6% for 2016.\nAccording to Cushman & Wakefield, new leasing activity in Manhattan in 2016 totaled approximately 26.3 million square feet. Of the total 2016 leasing activity in Manhattan, the Midtown submarket accounted for approximately 17.9 million square feet, or approximately 68.1%. Midtown's overall office vacancy increased from 8.5% at December 31, 2015 to 9.3% at December 31, 2016.\nOverall average asking rents in Manhattan increased in 2016 by 1.7% from $71.58 per square foot at December 31, 2015 to $72.82 per square foot at December 31, 2016. Midtown Manhattan average asking rents increased in 2016 by 2.3% from $76.65 per square foot at December 31, 2015 to $78.39 per square foot at December 31, 2016. The Midtown South average asking rent rose 1.7% year-over-year to $70.86 per square foot while downtown average asking rents decreased 0.5% year-over-year to $59.30 per square foot.\nAcquisition and Disposition Activity\nOverall Manhattan sales volume decreased by 31.5% in 2016 to $39.6 billion as compared to $57.8 billion in 2015. Consistent with our multi-faceted approach to property acquisitions, we selectively sourced the off-market purchase of a retail and residential mixed-use property that provides value enhancement opportunities for $28.5 million.\nWe also continued to take advantage of significant interest by both international and domestic institutions and individuals seeking ownership interests in Manhattan properties to sell assets, disposing of a significant volume of properties that were non-core or had more limited growth opportunities, raising efficiently priced capital that was used primarily for debt reduction. During the year, we sold all or part of our interest in 11 Madison Avenue, 388-390 Greenwich Street, 885 Third Avenue, 248-252 Bedford Avenue, 400 East 57th Street, 500 West Putnam and 7 International Drive for total gross valuations of $5.3 billion.\nDebt and Preferred Equity\nIn 2015 and 2016, in our debt and preferred equity portfolio we continued to focus on the origination of financings, typically in the form of mezzanine debt, for owners, acquirers or developers of New York City properties. This investment strategy provides us with the opportunity to fill a need for additional debt financing by providing higher leverage than are often available through traditional lending sources, while achieving attractive risk adjusted returns to us on the investments and receiving a significant amount of additional information on the New York City real estate market. The typical investments made by us during 2015 and 2016 were to reputable owners or acquirers which have sizable equity subordinate to our last dollar exposure. During 2016, our debt and preferred equity activities included purchases and originations, inclusive of advances under future funding obligations, discount and fee amortization, and paid-in-kind interest, net of premium amortization, of $1,015 million, and sales, redemption and participations of $1,045 million.\nFor descriptions of significant activities in 2016, refer to \"Part I, Item 1. Business - Highlights from 2016\".\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nInvestment in Commercial Real Estate Properties\nOn a periodic basis, we assess whether there are any indications that the value of our real estate properties may be other than temporarily impaired or that their carrying value may not be recoverable. A property's value is considered impaired if management's estimate of the aggregate future cash flows (undiscounted) to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the calculated fair value of the property.\nWe also evaluate our real estate properties for potential impairment when a real estate property has been classified as held for sale. Real estate assets held for sale are valued at the lower of either their carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. We do not believe that there were any indicators of impairment at any of our consolidated properties at December 31, 2016\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a $10.4 million charge in connection with the sale of one property, 500 West Putnam, which closed in the third quarter of 2016. This charge is included in depreciable real estate reserves in the consolidated statements of operations.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded a $19.2 million charge in connection with the sale of two of our properties, which closed in the fourth quarter of 2015. This charge is included in depreciable real estate reserves in the consolidated statements of operations.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, we entered into an agreement to sell 885 Third Avenue and recorded a $6.6 million charge which was included in gain on sale of real estate, net in the consolidated statement of operations. At December 31, 2015, 885 Third Avenue was not reclassified as held for sale as a result of not meeting the criteria in ASC 360-10, Property, Plant and Equipment - Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. In February 2016, we closed on the sale of this property but do not anticipate meeting the criteria for the full accrual method in ASC 360-20, Property, Plant and Equipment - Real Estate Sales and as a result the property will remain on our consolidated balance sheet until the criteria is met.\nWe incur a variety of costs in the development and leasing of our properties. After determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. The costs of land and building under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include, but are not limited to, pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. We consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year after major construction activity is completed. We cease capitalization on the portions substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy, and capitalize only those costs associated with the portions under construction.\nResults of operations of properties acquired are included in the consolidated statements of operations from the date of acquisition.\nWe recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed (including contingencies) and any noncontrolling interests in an acquired entity at their fair values on the acquisition date. We expense transaction costs related to the acquisition of certain assets as incurred, which are included in transaction related costs on our consolidated statements of operations.\nWhen we acquire our partner's equity interest in an existing unconsolidated joint venture and gain control over the investment, we record the consolidated investment at fair value. The difference between the book value of our equity investment on the purchase date and our share of the fair value of the investment's purchase price is recorded as a purchase price fair value adjustment in our consolidated statements of operations. In December 2015, we recognized a purchase price fair value adjustment of $40.1 million in connection with the consolidation of 600 Lexington Avenue. In May 2014, we recognized a purchase price fair value adjustment\nof $71.4 million in connection with the consolidation of 388-390 Greenwich Street. These acquisitions were previously accounted for as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures.\nWe allocate the purchase price of real estate to land and building (inclusive of tenant improvements) and, if determined to be material, intangibles, such as the value of above- and below-market leases and origination costs associated with the in-place leases. We depreciate the amount allocated to building (inclusive of tenant improvements) over their estimated useful lives, which generally range from three to 40 years. We amortize the amount allocated to the above- and below-market leases over the remaining term of the associated lease, which generally range from one to 14 years, and record it as either an increase (in the case of below-market leases) or a decrease (in the case of above-market leases) to rental income. We amortize the amount allocated to the values associated with in-place leases over the expected term of the associated lease, which generally ranges from one to 14 years. If a tenant vacates its space prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related intangible will be written off. The tenant improvements and origination costs are amortized as an expense over the remaining life of the lease (or charged against earnings if the lease is terminated prior to its contractual expiration date). We assess fair value of the leases based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property. To the extent acquired leases contain fixed rate renewal options that are below-market and determined to be material, we amortize such below-market lease value into rental income over the renewal period.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\nWe account for our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting in cases where we exercise significant influence over, but do not control, these entities and are not considered to be the primary beneficiary. We consolidate those joint ventures that we control or which are VIEs and where we are considered to be the primary beneficiary. In all these joint ventures, the rights of the joint venture partner are both protective as well as participating. Unless we are determined to be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, these participating rights preclude us from consolidating these VIE entities. These investments are recorded initially at cost, as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, and subsequently adjusted for equity in net income (loss) and cash contributions and distributions. Equity in net income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures is allocated based on our ownership or economic interest in each joint venture. When a capital event (as defined in each joint venture agreement) such as a refinancing occurs, if return thresholds are met, future equity income will be allocated at our increased economic interest. We recognize incentive income from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures as income to the extent it is earned and not subject to a clawback feature. Distributions we receive from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures in excess of our basis in the investment are recorded as offsets to our investment balance if we remain liable for future obligations of the joint venture or may otherwise be committed to provide future additional financial support. None of the joint venture debt is recourse to us. The Company has performance guarantees under master leases at two joint ventures. See Note 6, \"Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures.\"\nWe assess our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures for recoverability, and if it is determined that a loss in value of the investment is other than temporary, we write down the investment to its fair value. We evaluate our equity investments for impairment based on the joint ventures' projected discounted cash flows. We do not believe that the values of any of our equity investments were impaired at December 31, 2016.\nWe may originate loans for real estate acquisition, development and construction, where we expect to receive some of the residual profit from such projects. When the risk and rewards of these arrangements are essentially the same as an investor or joint venture partner, we account for these arrangements as real estate investments under the equity method of accounting for investments. Otherwise, we account for these arrangements consistent with our loan accounting for our debt and preferred equity investments.\nRevenue Recognition\nRental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases are included in deferred rents receivable on the consolidated balance sheets. We establish, on a current basis, an allowance for future potential tenant credit losses, which may occur against this account. The balance reflected on the consolidated balance sheets is net of such allowance.\nWe record a gain on sale of real estate when title is conveyed to the buyer, subject to the buyer's financial commitment being sufficient to provide economic substance to the sale and provided that we have no substantial economic involvement with the buyer.\nInterest income on debt and preferred equity investments is accrued based on the contractual terms of the instruments and when, in the opinion of management, it is deemed collectible. Some debt and preferred equity investments provide for accrual of interest at specified rates, which differ from current payment terms. Interest is recognized on such loans at the accrual rate subject to management's determination that accrued interest is ultimately collectible, based on the underlying collateral and operations of the borrower. If management cannot make this determination, interest income above the current pay rate is recognized only upon actual receipt.\nDeferred origination fees, original issue discounts and loan origination costs, if any, are recognized as an adjustment to the interest income over the terms of the related investments using the effective interest method. Fees received in connection with loan commitments are also deferred until the loan is funded and are then recognized over the term of the loan as an adjustment to yield.\nDebt and preferred equity investments are placed on a non-accrual status at the earlier of the date at which payments become 90 days past due or when, in the opinion of management, a full recovery of interest income becomes doubtful. Interest income recognition on any non-accrual debt or preferred equity investment is resumed when such non-accrual debt or preferred equity investment becomes contractually current and performance is demonstrated to be resumed. Interest is recorded as income on impaired loans only to the extent cash is received.\nWe may syndicate a portion of the loans that we originate or sell the loans individually. When a transaction meets the criteria for sale accounting, we derecognize the loan sold and recognize gain or loss based on the difference between the sales price and the carrying value of the loan sold. Any related unamortized deferred origination fees, original issue discounts, loan origination costs, discounts or premiums at the time of sale are recognized as an adjustment to the gain or loss on sale, which is included in investment income on the consolidated statement of operations. Any fees received at the time of sale or syndication are recognized as part of investment income.\nAsset management fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the asset management agreement.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our tenants to make required payments. If the financial condition of a specific tenant were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of its ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.\nReserve for Possible Credit Losses\nThe expense for possible credit losses in connection with debt and preferred equity investments is the charge to earnings to increase the allowance for possible credit losses to the level that we estimate to be adequate, based on Level 3 data, considering delinquencies, loss experience and collateral quality. Other factors considered include geographic trends, product diversification, the size of the portfolio and current economic conditions. Based upon these factors, we establish a provision for possible credit loss on each individual investment. When it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts contractually due, the investment is considered impaired.\nWhere impairment is indicated on an investment that is held to maturity, a valuation allowance is measured based upon the excess of the recorded investment amount over the net fair value of the collateral. Any deficiency between the carrying amount of an asset and the calculated value of the collateral is charged to expense. We continue to assess or adjust our estimates based on circumstances of a loan and the underlying collateral. If additional information reflects increased recovery of our investment, we will adjust our reserves accordingly. There were no loan reserves recorded during years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.\nDebt and preferred equity investments held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair market value using available market information obtained through consultation with dealers or other originators of such investments as well as discounted cash flow models based on Level 3 data pursuant to ASC 820-10. As circumstances change, management may conclude not to sell an investment designated as held for sale. In such situations, the investment will be reclassified at its net carrying value to debt and preferred equity investments held to maturity. For these reclassified investments, the difference between the current carrying value and the expected cash to be collected at maturity will be accreted into income over the remaining term of the investment.\nDerivative Instruments\nIn the normal course of business, we use a variety of commonly used derivative instruments, such as interest rate swaps, caps, collars and floors, to manage, or hedge, interest rate risk. Effectiveness is essential for those derivatives that we intend to qualify for hedge accounting. Some derivative instruments are associated with an anticipated transaction. In those cases, hedge effectiveness criteria also require that it be probable that the underlying transaction occurs. Instruments that meet these hedging criteria are formally designated as hedges at the inception of the derivative contract.\nTo determine the fair values of derivative instruments, we use a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date. For the majority of financial instruments including most derivatives, long-term investments and long-term debt, standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models, replacement cost, and termination cost are used to determine fair value. All methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2016 to the year ended December 31, 2015\nThe following comparison for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 2016, to the year ended December 31, 2015, or 2015, makes reference to the following: (i) the effect of the Same-Store Properties,\u201d which represents all operating properties owned by us at January 1, 2015 and still owned by us in the same manner at December 31, 2016 (Same-Store Properties totaled 55 of our 68 consolidated operating properties, representing 75.7% of our share of annualized cash rent), (ii) the effect of the Acquisition Properties,\u201d which represents all properties or interests in properties acquired in 2016 and 2015 and all non-Same-Store Properties, including properties that are under development, redevelopment or deconsolidated during the period, and (iii) Other,\u201d which represents corporate level items not allocable to specific properties, as well as the Service Corporation and eEmerge Inc. Any assets sold or held for sale are excluded from the income from continuing operations and from the following discussion.\n\nRental, Escalation and Reimbursement Revenues\nRental revenues increased primarily as a result of the properties acquired ($98.2 million), which included the acquisition of 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2015 together with the subsequent sale of a 40% interest in 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2016 ($59.2 million), the consolidation of 600 Lexington Avenue in the fourth quarter of 2015 ($19.3 million), and an increase in rents at our Same-Store Properties ($19.1 million). In addition, rental revenues increased as a result of the accelerated recognition\nof non-cash deferred income from 388-390 Greenwich Street as a result of Citigroup, Inc. (\"Citi\") exercising its option to purchase the property and entering into an agreement to accelerate the sale ($37.1 million). This increase was partially offset by the sale of 120 West 45th Street in the third quarter of 2015 ($18.3 million), the sale of 885 Third Avenue in the first quarter of 2016 ($11.9 million), as well as accounting write-offs ($17.4 million) and decreased cash revenue ($2.0 million) related to the space previously leased to Aeropostale at 1515 Broadway following the tenant's bankruptcy.\nEscalation and reimbursement revenue increased primarily as a result of higher real estate tax recoveries at the Same-Store Properties ($14.9 million) and Acquisition Properties ($7.6 million) attributable to an increase in the related tax expense. This was partially offset by decreased real estate tax recoveries due to the sale of 120 West 45th Street ($2.3 million), and 140 Grand Street ($1.3 million).\nOccupancy in our Same-Store Manhattan consolidated office operating portfolio, excluding leases signed but not yet commenced was 95.9% at December 31, 2016 as compared to 96.5% at December 31, 2015. Occupancy for our Same-Store Suburban consolidated office operating portfolio, excluding leases signed but not yet commenced, increased to 84.4% at December 31, 2016 as compared to 81.4% at December 31, 2015.\nThe following table presents a summary of the commenced leasing activity for the year ended December 31, 2016 in our Manhattan and Suburban portfolio:\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\n (1) Annual initial base rent. \n (2) Escalated rent is calculated as total annual income less electric charges. \n (3) Includes expiring space, relocating tenants and move-outs where tenants vacated. Excludes lease expirations where tenants held over. \n (4) Average starting office rent excluding new tenants replacing vacancies was $63.17 per rentable square feet for 112,581 rentable square feet. Average starting office rent for office space (leased and early renewals, excluding new tenants replacing vacancies) was $70.94 per rentable square feet for 154,379 rentable square feet. \n (5) Average starting office rent excluding new tenants replacing vacancies was $37.65 per rentable square feet for 24,635 rentable square feet. Average starting office rent for office space (leased and early renewals, excluding new tenants replacing vacancies) was $35.86 per rentable square feet for 63,040 rentable square feet.  At December 31, 2016, 5.3% and 7.7% of the office space leased at our consolidated Manhattan and Suburban operating properties, respectively, is expected to expire during 2017. Based on our estimates at December 31, 2016, the current market asking rents on these expected 2017 lease expirations at our consolidated Manhattan operating properties are 6.6% higher than the existing in-place fully escalated rents while the current market asking rents on all of our consolidated Manhattan operating properties are 10.2% higher than the existing in-place fully escalated rents on leases that are scheduled to expire in all future years. Based on our estimates at December 31, 2016, the current market asking rents on these expected 2016 lease expirations at our consolidated Suburban operating properties are 0.2% higher than the existing in-place fully escalated rents while the current market asking rents on all of our consolidated Suburban operating properties are 6.0% higher than the existing in-place fully escalated rents on leases that are scheduled to expire in all future years.\nInvestment Income\nInvestment income increased primarily as a result of additional income recognized from the recapitalization of a debt investment ($41.0 million). This increase was partially offset by a lower weighted average yield and balance for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the weighted average debt and preferred equity investment balance outstanding and weighted average yield were $1.5 billion and 9.7%, respectively, compared to $1.7 billion and 10.3%, respectively, for the same period in 2015. As of December 31, 2016, the debt and preferred equity investments had a fully extended weighted average term to maturity of 3.0 years.\nOther Income\nOther income increased primarily as a result of the lease termination fee earned in connection with the termination of the lease with Citigroup, Inc. at 388-390 Greenwich Avenue ($94.0 million), and promote income earned in connection with the sale of 33 Beekman ($10.8 million), which was partially offset by a lease termination fee received at 919 Third Avenue in 2015 ($11.3 million).\nProperty Operating Expenses\nProperty operating expenses increased primarily as a result of properties acquired ($25.9 million), which includes the acquisition 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2015 together with the subsequent sale of a 40% interest in 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2016 ($9.9 million), the consolidation of 600 Lexington Avenue ($8.6 million) in the fourth quarter if 2015, and higher operating expenses at the Same-Store Properties ($15.5 million) primarily driven by real estate taxes ($13.5 million). These increases were partially offset by a decrease in expenses stemming from our sold properties ($17.7 million), which included the sale of 120 West 45th St in the third quarter of 2015 ($9.8 million).\nMarketing, General and Administrative Expenses\nMarketing, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $99.8 million, or 4.7% of total combined revenues, including our share of joint venture revenues, and 53 basis points of total combined assets, including our share of joint venture assets compared to $94.9 million, or 5.0% of total revenues including our share of joint venture revenues, and 44 basis points of total combined assets including our share of joint venture assets for 2015.\nInterest Expense and Amortization of Deferred Financing Costs, Net of Interest Income\nInterest expense, net of interest income, decreased primarily as a result of the sale of 388-390 Greenwich Street in the second quarter of 2016 ($16.5 million), and the sale of 120 West 45th Street in the fourth quarter of 2015 ($7.7 million). These decreases were partially offset by the mortgage related to the acquisition of 11 Madison Avenue in the third quarter of 2015 ($20.8 million). The weighted average consolidated debt balance outstanding increased to $9.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $9.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. The weighted average interest rate was 3.87% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 3.78% for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization increased primarily as a result of the accelerated depreciation expense related to 388-390 Greenwich Street as a result of Citi exercising its option to purchase the property and entering into an agreement to accelerate the sale ($329.7 million). The increase is also driven by the acquisition of 100% interest of 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2015 together with the subsequent sale of a 40% interest in 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2016 ($52.5 million). These increases were partially offset by the accelerated depreciation in 2015 related to vacating the properties that comprise the One Vanderbilt development site ($146.6 million).\nEquity in Net Income in Unconsolidated Joint Venture/Real Estate\nEquity in net income from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased primarily as a result of the sale of a 40% interest in 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2016. The sale did not meet the criteria for sale accounting until December 2016 resulting in recognition of the other partner's share of depreciation ($8.4 million) in addition to our share of the operations of the property. The decrease was partially offset by an increase at 1552-1560 Broadway ($4.6 million) as a result of the settlement in February 2016 of arbitration regarding a tenant's rent at the property and revenue from a debt and preferred equity investment that was contributed to a joint venture in the first quarter of 2016 ($4.5 million), and from the increase at 650 Fifth Avenue as a result of the loan refinance in the third quarter of 2016 ($3.5 million).\nEquity in Net Gain on Sale of Interest in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016 we recognized a gain on the sale of 33 Beekman Street ($33.0 million), 7 Renaissance Square ($4.2 million), 1 Jericho ($3.3 million) and EOP Denver ($3.1 million), compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, in which we recognized a gain on sale associated with the sale of our joint venture interest at 315 West 36th Street ($16.3 million), partially offset by a loss on the sale of our joint venture interest at the Meadows ($1.6 million).\nPurchase Price Fair Value Adjustment\nThe purchase price fair value adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2015 was attributable to the acquisition of our joint venture partner's interest in 600 Lexington Avenue.\nGain on Sale of Real Estate\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a gain on sale associated with the sales of 388-390 Greenwich ($206.4 million), a 49% interest in 400 East 57th Street ($23.9 million), 248-252 Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn, New York ($15.3 million), and a 40% interest in 11 Madison Avenue ($3.6 million), partially offset by the loss on the sale of 7 International Drive, Westchester County, NY ($6.9 million). During the year ended December 31, 2015 we recognized a gain on sale associated with the sales of an 80% interest in 131-137 Spring Street ($101.1 million), 120 West 45th Street ($58.6 million), 570 & 574 Fifth Avenue ($24.6 million), partially offset by a loss on the sale of 885 Third Avenue ($6.6 million).\nDepreciable Real Estate Reserves\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized depreciable real estate reserves related to the sale of 500 West Putnam ($10.4 million), as compared to the same period in 2015 when we recognized depreciable real estate reserves related to the sale of two properties ($19.2 million).\nDiscontinued Operations\nDiscontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes the gain recognized on the sale of 180 Maiden Lane ($17.0 million) and the related results of operations. The Company adopted ASU 2014-08 effective January 1, 2015 which raised the threshold for disposals to qualify as discontinued operations to dispositions which represent a strategic shift in an entity's operations. The guidance was applied prospectively for new disposals. As a result, the results of operations for 388-390 Greenwich Street, which was classified as held for sale at March 31, 2016, 500 West Putnam Avenue, which was classified as held for sale at June 30, 2016 and 400 East 57th Street which was held for sale at September 30, 2016, are included in continuing operations for year ended December 31, 2016.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2014\nThe following comparison for the year ended December 31, 2015, or 2015, to the year ended December 31, 2014, or 2014, makes reference to the following: (i) the effect of the Same-Store Properties,\u201d which represents all operating properties owned by us at January 1, 2014 and still owned by us in the same manner at December 31, 2015 (Same-Store Properties totaled 54 of our 75 consolidated operating properties, representing 69.5% of our share of annualized cash rent), (ii) the effect of the Acquisition Properties,\u201d which represents all properties or interests in properties acquired in 2015 and 2014 and all non-Same-Store Properties, including properties that are under development, redevelopment or deconsolidated during the period, and (iii) Other,\u201d which represents corporate level items not allocable to specific properties, as well as the Service Corporation and eEmerge Inc. Any assets sold or held for sale are excluded from the income from continuing operations and from the following discussion.\n\nRental, Escalation and Reimbursement Revenues\nRental revenues increased primarily as a result of the properties acquired ($107.0 million), which included the consolidation of 388-390 Greenwich Street ($58.1 million), as discussed below, and the acquisition of 11 Madison Avenue ($33.9 million), an increase in occupancy at our Same-Store Properties ($33.8 million) and an increase in occupancy at two properties that were placed\ninto service ($9.2 million). This increase was partially offset by vacating the properties that comprise the One Vanderbilt development site ($16.6 million).\nIn May 2014, we acquired our joint venture partner's interest in 388-390 Greenwich Street thereby assuming full ownership of this triple net lease property. As a result of this acquisition, we consolidated the results of operations of this property beginning in May 2014. Prior to May 2014, we accounted for our investments in 388-390 Greenwich Street under the equity method of accounting. In January 2016, Citigroup, Inc. exercised its option to purchase 388-390 Greenwich Street for $2.0 billion, net of any unfunded tenant concessions. The closing occurred in June 2016.\nEscalation and reimbursement revenue increased primarily as a result of higher real estate tax recoveries ($10.8 million) at the Same-Store Properties attributable to an increase in the related real estate tax expense and properties recently acquired ($6.5 million), partially offset by vacating the properties that comprise the One Vanderbilt development site ($3.0 million).\nOccupancy in our Same-Store Manhattan consolidated office operating portfolio, excluding leases signed but not yet commenced, increased to 96.5% at December 31, 2015 as compared to 94.8% at December 31, 2014. Occupancy for our Same-Store Suburban consolidated office operating portfolio, excluding leases signed but not yet commenced, increased to 80.6% at December 31, 2015 as compared to 80.1% at December 31, 2014.\nThe following table presents a summary of the commenced leasing activity for the year ended December 31, 2015 in our Manhattan and Suburban portfolio:\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nSL Green Realty Corp., which is referred to as SL Green or the Company, a Maryland corporation, and SL Green Operating Partnership, L.P., which is referred to as SLGOP or the Operating Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership, were formed in June 1997 for the purpose of combining the commercial real estate business of S.L. Green Properties, Inc. and its affiliated partnerships and entities. The Company is a self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, with in-house capabilities in commercial and residential property management, acquisitions and dispositions, financing, development and redevelopment, construction and leasing. Unless the context requires otherwise, all references to \"we,\" \"our\" and \"us\" means the Company and all entities owned or controlled by the Company, including the Operating Partnership.\nReckson Associates Realty Corp., or Reckson, and Reckson Operating Partnership, L.P. or ROP, are wholly-owned subsidiaries of the SL Green Realty Corp.\nThe following discussion related to our consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements appearing in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe New York City commercial real estate market remained strong in 2016, and we took advantage of this market in improving asking rents and strategically selling or forming joint venture properties at attractive market valuations.\nLeasing and Operating\nIn 2016, our same-store Manhattan office property occupancy based on leases signed was 97.1% compared to 97.2% in the prior year. We signed office leases in Manhattan encompassing approximately 3.2 million square feet, of which approximately 2.6 million square feet represented office leases that replaced previously occupied space. Our mark-to-market on these approximately 2.6 million square feet of signed Manhattan office leases that replaced previously occupied space was 27.6% for 2016.\nAccording to Cushman & Wakefield, new leasing activity in Manhattan in 2016 totaled approximately 26.3 million square feet. Of the total 2016 leasing activity in Manhattan, the Midtown submarket accounted for approximately 17.9 million square feet, or approximately 68.1%. Midtown's overall office vacancy increased from 8.5% at December 31, 2015 to 9.3% at December 31, 2016.\nOverall average asking rents in Manhattan increased in 2016 by 1.7% from $71.58 per square foot at December 31, 2015 to $72.82 per square foot at December 31, 2016. Midtown Manhattan average asking rents increased in 2016 by 2.3% from $76.65 per square foot at December 31, 2015 to $78.39 per square foot at December 31, 2016. The Midtown South average asking rent rose 1.7% year-over-year to $70.86 per square foot while downtown average asking rents decreased 0.5% year-over-year to $59.30 per square foot.\nAcquisition and Disposition Activity\nOverall Manhattan sales volume decreased by 31.5% in 2016 to $39.6 billion as compared to $57.8 billion in 2015. Consistent with our multi-faceted approach to property acquisitions, we selectively sourced the off-market purchase of a retail and residential mixed-use property that provides value enhancement opportunities for $28.5 million.\nWe also continued to take advantage of significant interest by both international and domestic institutions and individuals seeking ownership interests in Manhattan properties to sell assets, disposing of a significant volume of properties that were non-core or had more limited growth opportunities, raising efficiently priced capital that was used primarily for debt reduction. During the year, we sold all or part of our interest in 11 Madison Avenue, 388-390 Greenwich Street, 885 Third Avenue, 248-252 Bedford Avenue, 400 East 57th Street, 500 West Putnam and 7 International Drive for total gross valuations of $5.3 billion.\nDebt and Preferred Equity\nIn 2015 and 2016, in our debt and preferred equity portfolio we continued to focus on the origination of financings, typically in the form of mezzanine debt, for owners, acquirers or developers of New York City properties. This investment strategy provides us with the opportunity to fill a need for additional debt financing by providing higher leverage than are often available through traditional lending sources, while achieving attractive risk adjusted returns to us on the investments and receiving a significant amount of additional information on the New York City real estate market. The typical investments made by us during 2015 and 2016 were to reputable owners or acquirers which have sizable equity subordinate to our last dollar exposure. During 2016, our debt and preferred equity activities included purchases and originations, inclusive of advances under future funding obligations, discount and fee amortization, and paid-in-kind interest, net of premium amortization, of $1,015 million, and sales, redemption and participations of $1,045 million.\nFor descriptions of significant activities in 2016, refer to \"Part I, Item 1. Business - Highlights from 2016\".\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nInvestment in Commercial Real Estate Properties\nOn a periodic basis, we assess whether there are any indications that the value of our real estate properties may be other than temporarily impaired or that their carrying value may not be recoverable. A property's value is considered impaired if management's estimate of the aggregate future cash flows (undiscounted) to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the calculated fair value of the property.\nWe also evaluate our real estate properties for potential impairment when a real estate property has been classified as held for sale. Real estate assets held for sale are valued at the lower of either their carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. We do not believe that there were any indicators of impairment at any of our consolidated properties at December 31, 2016\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a $10.4 million charge in connection with the sale of one property, 500 West Putnam, which closed in the third quarter of 2016. This charge is included in depreciable real estate reserves in the consolidated statements of operations.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded a $19.2 million charge in connection with the sale of two of our properties, which closed in the fourth quarter of 2015. This charge is included in depreciable real estate reserves in the consolidated statements of operations.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, we entered into an agreement to sell 885 Third Avenue and recorded a $6.6 million charge which was included in gain on sale of real estate, net in the consolidated statement of operations. At December 31, 2015, 885 Third Avenue was not reclassified as held for sale as a result of not meeting the criteria in ASC 360-10, Property, Plant and Equipment - Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. In February 2016, we closed on the sale of this property but do not anticipate meeting the criteria for the full accrual method in ASC 360-20, Property, Plant and Equipment - Real Estate Sales and as a result the property will remain on our consolidated balance sheet until the criteria is met.\nWe incur a variety of costs in the development and leasing of our properties. After determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. The costs of land and building under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include, but are not limited to, pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. We consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year after major construction activity is completed. We cease capitalization on the portions substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy, and capitalize only those costs associated with the portions under construction.\nResults of operations of properties acquired are included in the consolidated statements of operations from the date of acquisition.\nWe recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed (including contingencies) and any noncontrolling interests in an acquired entity at their fair values on the acquisition date. We expense transaction costs related to the acquisition of certain assets as incurred, which are included in transaction related costs on our consolidated statements of operations.\nWhen we acquire our partner's equity interest in an existing unconsolidated joint venture and gain control over the investment, we record the consolidated investment at fair value. The difference between the book value of our equity investment on the purchase date and our share of the fair value of the investment's purchase price is recorded as a purchase price fair value adjustment in our consolidated statements of operations. In December 2015, we recognized a purchase price fair value adjustment of $40.1 million in connection with the consolidation of 600 Lexington Avenue. In May 2014, we recognized a purchase price fair value adjustment\nof $71.4 million in connection with the consolidation of 388-390 Greenwich Street. These acquisitions were previously accounted for as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures.\nWe allocate the purchase price of real estate to land and building (inclusive of tenant improvements) and, if determined to be material, intangibles, such as the value of above- and below-market leases and origination costs associated with the in-place leases. We depreciate the amount allocated to building (inclusive of tenant improvements) over their estimated useful lives, which generally range from three to 40 years. We amortize the amount allocated to the above- and below-market leases over the remaining term of the associated lease, which generally range from one to 14 years, and record it as either an increase (in the case of below-market leases) or a decrease (in the case of above-market leases) to rental income. We amortize the amount allocated to the values associated with in-place leases over the expected term of the associated lease, which generally ranges from one to 14 years. If a tenant vacates its space prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related intangible will be written off. The tenant improvements and origination costs are amortized as an expense over the remaining life of the lease (or charged against earnings if the lease is terminated prior to its contractual expiration date). We assess fair value of the leases based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property. To the extent acquired leases contain fixed rate renewal options that are below-market and determined to be material, we amortize such below-market lease value into rental income over the renewal period.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\nWe account for our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting in cases where we exercise significant influence over, but do not control, these entities and are not considered to be the primary beneficiary. We consolidate those joint ventures that we control or which are VIEs and where we are considered to be the primary beneficiary. In all these joint ventures, the rights of the joint venture partner are both protective as well as participating. Unless we are determined to be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, these participating rights preclude us from consolidating these VIE entities. These investments are recorded initially at cost, as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, and subsequently adjusted for equity in net income (loss) and cash contributions and distributions. Equity in net income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures is allocated based on our ownership or economic interest in each joint venture. When a capital event (as defined in each joint venture agreement) such as a refinancing occurs, if return thresholds are met, future equity income will be allocated at our increased economic interest. We recognize incentive income from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures as income to the extent it is earned and not subject to a clawback feature. Distributions we receive from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures in excess of our basis in the investment are recorded as offsets to our investment balance if we remain liable for future obligations of the joint venture or may otherwise be committed to provide future additional financial support. None of the joint venture debt is recourse to us. The Company has performance guarantees under master leases at two joint ventures. See Note 6, \"Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures.\"\nWe assess our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures for recoverability, and if it is determined that a loss in value of the investment is other than temporary, we write down the investment to its fair value. We evaluate our equity investments for impairment based on the joint ventures' projected discounted cash flows. We do not believe that the values of any of our equity investments were impaired at December 31, 2016.\nWe may originate loans for real estate acquisition, development and construction, where we expect to receive some of the residual profit from such projects. When the risk and rewards of these arrangements are essentially the same as an investor or joint venture partner, we account for these arrangements as real estate investments under the equity method of accounting for investments. Otherwise, we account for these arrangements consistent with our loan accounting for our debt and preferred equity investments.\nRevenue Recognition\nRental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases are included in deferred rents receivable on the consolidated balance sheets. We establish, on a current basis, an allowance for future potential tenant credit losses, which may occur against this account. The balance reflected on the consolidated balance sheets is net of such allowance.\nWe record a gain on sale of real estate when title is conveyed to the buyer, subject to the buyer's financial commitment being sufficient to provide economic substance to the sale and provided that we have no substantial economic involvement with the buyer.\nInterest income on debt and preferred equity investments is accrued based on the contractual terms of the instruments and when, in the opinion of management, it is deemed collectible. Some debt and preferred equity investments provide for accrual of interest at specified rates, which differ from current payment terms. Interest is recognized on such loans at the accrual rate subject to management's determination that accrued interest is ultimately collectible, based on the underlying collateral and operations of the borrower. If management cannot make this determination, interest income above the current pay rate is recognized only upon actual receipt.\nDeferred origination fees, original issue discounts and loan origination costs, if any, are recognized as an adjustment to the interest income over the terms of the related investments using the effective interest method. Fees received in connection with loan commitments are also deferred until the loan is funded and are then recognized over the term of the loan as an adjustment to yield.\nDebt and preferred equity investments are placed on a non-accrual status at the earlier of the date at which payments become 90 days past due or when, in the opinion of management, a full recovery of interest income becomes doubtful. Interest income recognition on any non-accrual debt or preferred equity investment is resumed when such non-accrual debt or preferred equity investment becomes contractually current and performance is demonstrated to be resumed. Interest is recorded as income on impaired loans only to the extent cash is received.\nWe may syndicate a portion of the loans that we originate or sell the loans individually. When a transaction meets the criteria for sale accounting, we derecognize the loan sold and recognize gain or loss based on the difference between the sales price and the carrying value of the loan sold. Any related unamortized deferred origination fees, original issue discounts, loan origination costs, discounts or premiums at the time of sale are recognized as an adjustment to the gain or loss on sale, which is included in investment income on the consolidated statement of operations. Any fees received at the time of sale or syndication are recognized as part of investment income.\nAsset management fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the asset management agreement.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our tenants to make required payments. If the financial condition of a specific tenant were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of its ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.\nReserve for Possible Credit Losses\nThe expense for possible credit losses in connection with debt and preferred equity investments is the charge to earnings to increase the allowance for possible credit losses to the level that we estimate to be adequate, based on Level 3 data, considering delinquencies, loss experience and collateral quality. Other factors considered include geographic trends, product diversification, the size of the portfolio and current economic conditions. Based upon these factors, we establish a provision for possible credit loss on each individual investment. When it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts contractually due, the investment is considered impaired.\nWhere impairment is indicated on an investment that is held to maturity, a valuation allowance is measured based upon the excess of the recorded investment amount over the net fair value of the collateral. Any deficiency between the carrying amount of an asset and the calculated value of the collateral is charged to expense. We continue to assess or adjust our estimates based on circumstances of a loan and the underlying collateral. If additional information reflects increased recovery of our investment, we will adjust our reserves accordingly. There were no loan reserves recorded during years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.\nDebt and preferred equity investments held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair market value using available market information obtained through consultation with dealers or other originators of such investments as well as discounted cash flow models based on Level 3 data pursuant to ASC 820-10. As circumstances change, management may conclude not to sell an investment designated as held for sale. In such situations, the investment will be reclassified at its net carrying value to debt and preferred equity investments held to maturity. For these reclassified investments, the difference between the current carrying value and the expected cash to be collected at maturity will be accreted into income over the remaining term of the investment.\nDerivative Instruments\nIn the normal course of business, we use a variety of commonly used derivative instruments, such as interest rate swaps, caps, collars and floors, to manage, or hedge, interest rate risk. Effectiveness is essential for those derivatives that we intend to qualify for hedge accounting. Some derivative instruments are associated with an anticipated transaction. In those cases, hedge effectiveness criteria also require that it be probable that the underlying transaction occurs. Instruments that meet these hedging criteria are formally designated as hedges at the inception of the derivative contract.\nTo determine the fair values of derivative instruments, we use a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date. For the majority of financial instruments including most derivatives, long-term investments and long-term debt, standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models, replacement cost, and termination cost are used to determine fair value. All methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2016 to the year ended December 31, 2015\nThe following comparison for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 2016, to the year ended December 31, 2015, or 2015, makes reference to the following: (i) the effect of the Same-Store Properties,\u201d which represents all operating properties owned by us at January 1, 2015 and still owned by us in the same manner at December 31, 2016 (Same-Store Properties totaled 55 of our 68 consolidated operating properties, representing 75.7% of our share of annualized cash rent), (ii) the effect of the Acquisition Properties,\u201d which represents all properties or interests in properties acquired in 2016 and 2015 and all non-Same-Store Properties, including properties that are under development, redevelopment or deconsolidated during the period, and (iii) Other,\u201d which represents corporate level items not allocable to specific properties, as well as the Service Corporation and eEmerge Inc. Any assets sold or held for sale are excluded from the income from continuing operations and from the following discussion.\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

properties acquired ($98.2 million), which included the acquisition of 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2015 together with the subsequent sale of a 40% interest in 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2016 ($59.2 million), the consolidation of 600 Lexington Avenue in the fourth quarter of 2015 ($19.3 million), and an increase in rents at our Same-Store Properties ($19.1 million). In addition, rental revenues increased as a result of the accelerated recognition\nof non-cash deferred income from 388-390 Greenwich Street as a result of Citigroup, Inc. (\"Citi\") exercising its option to purchase the property and entering into an agreement to accelerate the sale ($37.1 million). This increase was partially offset by the sale of 120 West 45th Street in the third quarter of 2015 ($18.3 million), the sale of 885 Third Avenue in the first quarter of 2016 ($11.9 million), as well as accounting write-offs ($17.4 million) and decreased cash revenue ($2.0 million) related to the space previously leased to Aeropostale at 1515 Broadway following the tenant's bankruptcy.\nEscalation and reimbursement revenue increased primarily as a result of higher real estate tax recoveries at the Same-Store Properties ($14.9 million) and Acquisition Properties ($7.6 million) attributable to an increase in the related tax expense. This was partially offset by decreased real estate tax recoveries due to the sale of 120 West 45th Street ($2.3 million), and 140 Grand Street ($1.3 million).\nOccupancy in our Same-Store Manhattan consolidated office operating portfolio, excluding leases signed but not yet commenced was 95.9% at December 31, 2016 as compared to 96.5% at December 31, 2015. Occupancy for our Same-Store Suburban consolidated office operating portfolio, excluding leases signed but not yet commenced, increased to 84.4% at December 31, 2016 as compared to 81.4% at December

\n (3) Includes expiring space, relocating tenants and move-outs where tenants vacated. Excludes lease expirations where tenants held over. \n (4) Average starting office rent excluding new tenants replacing vacancies was $63.17 per rentable square feet for 112,581 rentable square feet. Average starting office rent for office space (leased and early renewals, excluding new tenants replacing vacancies) was $70.94 per rentable square feet for 154,379 rentable square feet. \n (5) Average starting office rent excluding new tenants replacing vacancies was $37.65 per rentable square feet for 24,635 rentable square feet. Average starting office rent for office space (leased and early renewals, excluding new tenants replacing vacancies) was $35.86 per rentable square feet for 63,040 rentable square feet.  At December 31, 2016, 5.3% and 7.7% of the office space leased at our consolidated Manhattan and Suburban operating properties, respectively, is expected to expire during 2017. Based on our estimates at December 31, 2016, the current market asking rents on these expected 2017 lease expirations at our consolidated Manhattan operating properties are 6.6% higher than the existing in-place fully escalated rents while the current market asking rents on all of our consolidated Manhattan operating properties are 10.2% higher than the existing in-place fully escalated rents on leases that are scheduled to expire in all future years. Based on our estimates at December 31, 2016, the current market asking rents on these expected 2016 lease expirations at our consolidated Suburban operating properties are 0.2% higher than the existing in-place fully escalated rents while the current market asking rents on all of our consolidated Suburban operating properties are 6.0% higher than the existing in-place fully escalated rents on leases that are scheduled to expire in all future years.\nInvestment Income\nInvestment income increased primarily as a result of additional income recognized from the recapitalization of a debt investment ($41.0 million). This increase was partially offset by a lower weighted average yield and balance for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the weighted average debt and preferred equity investment balance outstanding and weighted average yield were $1.5 billion and 9.7%, respectively, compared to $1.7 billion and 10.3%, respectively, for the same period in 2015. As of December 31, 2016, the debt and preferred equity investments had a fully extended weighted average term to maturity of 3.0 years.\nOther Income\nOther income increased primarily as a result of the lease termination fee earned in connection with the termination of the lease with Citigroup, Inc. at 388-390 Greenwich Avenue ($94.0 million), and promote income earned in connection with the sale of 33 Beekman ($10.8 million), which was partially offset by a lease termination fee received at 919 Third Avenue in 2015 ($11.3 million).\nProperty Operating Expenses\nProperty operating expenses increased primarily as a result of properties acquired ($25.9 million), which includes the acquisition 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2015 together with the subsequent sale of a 40% interest in 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2016 ($9.9 million), the consolidation of 600 Lexington Avenue ($8.6 million) in the fourth quarter if 2015, and higher operating expenses at the Same-Store Properties ($15.5 million) primarily driven by real estate taxes ($13.5 million). These increases were partially offset by a decrease in expenses stemming from our sold properties ($17.7 million), which included the sale of 120 West 45th St in the third quarter of 2015 ($9.8 million).\nMarketing, General and Administrative Expenses\nMarketing, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $99.8 million, or 4.7% of total combined revenues, including our share of joint venture revenues, and 53 basis points of total combined assets, including our share of joint venture assets compared to $94.9 million, or 5.0% of total revenues including our share of joint venture revenues, and 44 basis points of total combined assets including our share of joint venture assets for 2015.\nInterest Expense and Amortization of Deferred Financing Costs, Net of Interest Income\nInterest expense, net of interest income, decreased primarily as a result of the sale of 388-390 Greenwich Street in the second quarter of 2016 ($16.5 million), and the sale of 120 West 45th Street in the fourth quarter of 2015 ($7.7 million). These decreases were partially offset by the mortgage related to the acquisition of 11 Madison Avenue in the third quarter of 2015 ($20.8 million). The weighted average consolidated debt balance outstanding increased to $9.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $9.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. The weighted average interest rate was 3.87% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 3.78% for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization increased primarily as a result of the accelerated depreciation expense related to 388-390 Greenwich Street as a result of Citi exercising its option to purchase the property and entering into an agreement to accelerate the sale ($329.7 million). The increase is also driven by the acquisition of 100% interest of 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2015 together with the subsequent sale of a 40% interest in 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2016 ($52.5 million). These increases were partially offset by the accelerated depreciation in 2015 related to vacating the properties that comprise the One Vanderbilt development site ($146.6 million).\nEquity in Net Income in Unconsolidated Joint Venture/Real Estate\nEquity in net income from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased primarily as a result of the sale of a 40% interest in 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2016. The sale did not meet the criteria for sale accounting until December 2016 resulting in recognition of the other partner's share of depreciation ($8.4 million) in addition to our share of the operations of the property. The decrease was partially offset by an increase at 1552-1560 Broadway ($4.6 million) as a result of the settlement in February 2016 of arbitration regarding a tenant's rent at the property and revenue from a debt and preferred equity investment that was contributed to a joint venture in the first quarter of 2016 ($4.5 million), and from the increase at 650 Fifth Avenue as a result of the loan refinance in the third quarter of 2016 ($3.5 million).\nEquity in Net Gain on Sale of Interest in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016 we recognized a gain on the sale of 33 Beekman Street ($33.0 million), 7 Renaissance Square ($4.2 million), 1 Jericho ($3.3 million) and EOP Denver ($3.1 million), compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, in which we recognized a gain on sale associated with the sale of our joint venture interest at 315 West 36th Street ($16.3 million), partially offset by a loss on the sale of our joint venture interest at the Meadows ($1.6 million).\nPurchase Price Fair Value Adjustment\nThe purchase price fair value adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2015 was attributable to the acquisition of our joint venture partner's interest in 600 Lexington Avenue.\nGain on Sale of Real Estate\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a gain on sale associated with the sales of 388-390 Greenwich ($206.4 million), a 49% interest in 400 East 57th Street ($23.9 million), 248-252 Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn, New York ($15.3 million), and a 40% interest in 11 Madison Avenue ($3.6 million), partially offset by the loss on the sale of 7 International Drive, Westchester County, NY ($6.9 million). During the year ended December 31, 2015 we recognized a gain on sale associated with the sales of an 80% interest in 131-137 Spring Street ($101.1 million), 120 West 45th Street ($58.6 million), 570 & 574 Fifth Avenue ($24.6 million), partially offset by a loss on the sale of 885 Third Avenue ($6.6 million).\nDepreciable Real Estate Reserves\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized depreciable real estate reserves related to the sale of 500 West Putnam ($10.4 million), as compared to the same period in 2015 when we recognized depreciable real estate reserves related to the sale of two properties ($19.2 million).\nDiscontinued Operations\nDiscontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes the gain recognized on the sale of 180 Maiden Lane ($17.0 million) and the related results of operations. The Company adopted ASU 2014-08 effective January 1, 2015 which raised the threshold for disposals to qualify as discontinued operations to dispositions which represent a strategic shift in an entity's operations. The guidance was applied prospectively for new disposals. As a result, the results of operations for 388-390 Greenwich Street, which was classified as held for sale at March 31, 2016, 500 West Putnam Avenue, which was classified as held for sale at June 30, 2016 and 400 East 57th Street which was held for sale at September 30, 2016, are included in continuing operations for year ended December 31, 2016.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2014\nThe following comparison for the year ended December 31, 2015, or 2015, to the year ended December 31, 2014, or 2014, makes reference to the following: (i) the effect of the Same-Store Properties,\u201d which represents all operating properties owned by us at January 1, 2014 and still owned by us in the same manner at December 31, 2015 (Same-Store Properties totaled 54 of our 75 consolidated operating properties, representing 69.5% of our share of annualized cash rent), (ii) the effect of the Acquisition Properties,\u201d which represents all properties or interests in properties acquired in 2015 and 2014 and all non-Same-Store Properties, including properties that are under development, redevelopment or deconsolidated during the period, and (iii) Other,\u201d which represents corporate level items not allocable to specific properties, as well as the Service Corporation and eEmerge Inc.

properties acquired ($107.0 million), which included the consolidation of 388-390 Greenwich Street ($58.1 million), as discussed below, and the acquisition of 11 Madison Avenue ($33.9 million), an increase in occupancy at our Same-Store Properties ($33.8 million) and an increase in occupancy at two properties that were placed\ninto service ($9.2 million). This increase was partially offset by vacating the properties that comprise the One Vanderbilt development site ($16.6 million).\nIn May 2014, we acquired our joint venture partner's interest in 388-390 Greenwich Street thereby assuming full ownership of this triple net lease property. As a result of this acquisition, we consolidated the results of operations of this property beginning in May 2014. Prior to May 2014, we accounted for our investments in 388-390 Greenwich Street under the equity method of accounting. In January 2016, Citigroup, Inc. exercised its option to purchase 388-390 Greenwich Street for $2.0 billion, net of any unfunded tenant concessions. The closing occurred in June 2016.\nEscalation and reimbursement revenue increased primarily as a result of higher real estate tax recoveries ($10.8 million) at the Same-Store Properties attributable to an increase in the related real estate tax expense and properties recently acquired ($6.5 million), partially offset by vacating the properties that comprise the One Vanderbilt development site ($3.0 million).\nOccupancy in our Same-Store Manhattan consolidated office operating portfolio, excluding leases signed but not yet commenced, increased to 96.5% at December 31, 2015 as compared to 94.8% at December 31, 2014. Occupancy for our Same-Store Suburban consolidated office operating portfolio, excluding leases signed but not yet commenced, increased to 80.6% at December 31, 2015 as compared to 80.1% at December
