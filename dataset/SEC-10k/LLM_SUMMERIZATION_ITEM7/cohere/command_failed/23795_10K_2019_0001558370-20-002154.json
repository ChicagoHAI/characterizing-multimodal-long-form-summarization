MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW\nForward-Looking Statements\nWhen the Company uses any words such as anticipate,\u201d assume,\u201d believe,\u201d estimate,\u201d expect,\u201d intend,\u201d or similar expressions, the Company is making forward-looking statements. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon current expectations and reasonable assumptions, the Company's actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Certain factors or risks that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those the Company anticipates or projects are described in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Given these uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any document incorporated herein by reference. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRecent Developments Impacting our Business\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company completed the following transactions that were transformational to the Company and its operating results for the year ended December 31, 2019 and meaningful to its ongoing operations in the periods subsequent to December 31, 2019:\nTable 98: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLand JV Transaction\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn October 16, 2019, the Company completed the sale of a controlling interest in its wholly-owned subsidiary, Crisp39 SPV LLC to affiliates of Magnetar Capital LLC (the Magnetar Land Sale\u201d); (i) Flacto, LLC ( Flacto\u201d); (ii) Magnetar Longhorn Fund LP ( Longhorn\u201d); and (iii) Magnetar Structured Credit Fund, LP ( Magnetar SCF\u201d and collectively with Flacto and Longhorn, the Magnetar Investors\u201d) pursuant to an Interest Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d), for $97 million. Crisp39 SPV LLC holds the approximately 5,300 acres of undeveloped land in Daytona Beach, Florida (the Land JV\u201d). Following the closing of the Purchase Agreement, the Magnetar Investors collectively own a notional 66.50% equity interest in the Land JV, and the Company owns a notional 33.50% equity interest in the Land JV (collectively, the Company and the Magnetar Investors are herein referred to as the JV Partners\u201d). The transaction resulted in a gain of approximately $78.6 million, or approximately $12.21 per share, after tax, on the sale of the 66.50% equity interest in the Land JV and a non-cash gain of approximately $48.9 million on the Company's retained interest in the Land JV, or approximately $7.59 per share, after tax.\nThe Company serves as the manager (the Manager\u201d) of the Land JV and is responsible for day-to-day operations at the direction of the JV Partners. All major decisions and certain other actions must be approved by the unanimous consent of the JV Partners (the Unanimous Actions\u201d). Unanimous Actions include the approval of pricing for all land parcels in the Land JV; approval of contracts for the sale of land that contain material revisions to the standard purchase contract of the Land JV; entry into any lease agreement affiliated with the Land JV; entering into listing or brokerage agreements; approval and amendment of the Land JV's operating budget; obtaining financing for the Land JV; admission of additional members; and dispositions of the Land JV's real property for amounts less than market value. Pursuant to the Limited Liability Agreement of the Land JV will pay the Manager a management fee in the initial amount of $20,000 per month, which amount will be evaluated on a quarterly basis and reduced based on the value of real property that remains in the Land JV.\nAs a result of the Magnetar Land Sale, the Company has effectively divested all of its land holdings and as such the impact of the occurrence of land sales, which had been a primary element of the Company's business for virtually its entire history, has been essentially eliminated. In addition, the need for utilizing the 1031 like-kind exchange structure to deploy proceeds from land sales into replacement assets, primarily income properties, has also been reduced substantially.\n\t\t\nTable 99: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAlpine Income Property Trust, Inc. (NYSE: PINE)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn November 26, 2019, as part of the initial public offering (the IPO\u201d) of Alpine Income Property Trust, Inc. ( PINE\u201d) on the New York Stock Exchange, the Company and certain of its affiliates entered into purchase and sale agreements with PINE and Alpine Income Property OP, LP (the PINE OP\u201d), pursuant to which the Company and such affiliates sold, and PINE or the PINE OP purchased, 15 properties for aggregate cash consideration of $125.9 million (collectively, the Purchase and Sale Transaction\u201d). In addition, the Company and certain of its affiliates entered into contribution agreements with the PINE OP, pursuant to which the Company and such affiliates contributed to the PINE OP five properties (the Contributed Properties\u201d) for an aggregate of 1,223,854 OP units of the PINE OP (the OP Units\u201d), which have an initial value of approximately $23.3 million (the Contribution Transaction\u201d), and collectively with the Purchase and Sale Transaction, (the PINE Income Property Sale Transactions\u201d). The PINE Income Property Sale Transactions resulted in a gain of approximately $1.0 million, or approximately $0.16 per share, after tax.\nConcurrently with the PINE Income Property Sale Transactions, the Company purchased 394,737 shares of PINE common stock for a total purchase price of $7.5 million (the Private Placement\u201d). Also, on November 26, 2019, the Company purchased 421,053 shares of PINE common stock in the IPO for a total purchase price of $8.0 million (the IPO Purchase\u201d and together with the Private Placement, the Equity Transactions\u201d). Including the Company's investment in PINE as a result of receiving 1,223,854 OP Units, the Company owns, in the aggregate, approximately 2.04 million shares of PINE common stock, or approximately 22.3% of PINE's total shares outstanding.\nIn addition to the PINE Income Property Sale Transactions, the PINE IPO was significant for the Company and our business because concurrent with the PINE IPO, the Company entered into a management agreement with PINE (the Management Agreement\u201d) pursuant to which the Company is responsible for managing, operating, and administering the day-to-day operations, business and affairs of PINE, subject to the direction and supervision of PINE's board of directors (the PINE Board\u201d) and in accordance with the investment guidelines approved and monitored by the PINE Board. Pursuant to the Management Agreement, PINE agreed to pay the Company a base management fee equal to 0.375% per quarter (or 1.5% annually) of PINE's total equity\u201d (as defined in the Management Agreement) calculated and payable in cash, quarterly in arrears. Based on the equity raised in PINE's IPO and the Private Placement, the initial base management fee would approximate $2.6 million. In addition, we have the ability to earn an incentive fee based on PINE's shareholders achieving an annual return that exceeds an 8% annual hurdle, subject to a high-water mark price. The amount of the incentive fee would equal 15% of the amount by which the PINE shareholders annual return exceeds 8% in any given year. The initial term of the Management Agreement is five (5) years and the Management Agreement cannot be terminated by either party during the initial term except for certain definitive events which pertain primarily to our default or lack of performance. We also entered into an exclusivity and right of first offer agreement (the Exclusivity and ROFO Agreement\u201d) with PINE at the date of its IPO. Pursuant to the Exclusivity and ROFO Agreement the Company agreed not to invest in single-tenant net lease income properties, with limited exceptions. Further, the Company agreed to provide PINE with a right of first offer should the Company decided to sell any of its remaining portfolio of single-tenant net leased income properties in the future.\nTable 100: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nGolf Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn October 17, 2019, the Company sold its interest in the golf operations for $3.45 million (the Golf Sale\u201d), resulting in no gain on the transaction. The Company provided the buyer with financing in the form of an approximately $2.1 million first mortgage loan with a term of one year. As a result of the sale of the golf operations, the Company is no longer engaged in the ownership and operation of LPGA or any other golf club business.\n\t\t\nOur Business\nWe are a diversified real estate operating company that was founded in 1910. As of December 31, 2019, we own and manage, sometimes utilizing third-party property management companies, thirty-four commercial real estate properties in eleven states in the United States, with approximately 1.8 million square feet of gross leasable space. These thirty-four properties in our portfolio comprise our income property operations segment.\nIn addition to our income property portfolio, as of December 31, 2019, or business included the following:\nManagement Services:\nTable 101: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nA fee-based management business that is engaged in managing PINE and the Land JV, see Note 5, Related Party Management Services Business\u201d.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommercial Loan Investments:\nTable 102: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nA portfolio of commercial loan investments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nReal Estate Operations:\nTable 103: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nA portfolio of mineral interests consisting of approximately 455,000 subsurface acres in 20 counties in the state of Florida and a portfolio of mitigation credits;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nA retained interest in the Land JV which is seeking to sell approximately 5,300 acres of undeveloped land in Daytona Beach, Florida; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAn interest in a joint venture (the Mitigation Bank JV\u201d) that owns an approximately 2,500 acre parcel of land in the western part of Daytona Beach, Florida which is engaged in the operation of a mitigation bank, which, pursuant to a mitigation plan approved by the applicable state and federal authorities, produces mitigation credits that are marketed and sold to developers of land in the Daytona Beach area for the purpose of enabling the developers to obtain certain regulatory permits.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur business also includes, as outlined above, our investment in PINE of approximately $38.8 million resulting from the Equity Transactions, or approximately 22.3% of the PINE's outstanding equity, including the OP Units which are exchangeable into common stock of PINE on a one-for-one basis, at PINE's election. Our investment in PINE should generate investment income through the dividends distributed by PINE. In addition to the dividends we receive from PINE, our investment in PINE may benefit from any appreciation in PINE's stock price, although no assurances can be provided that such appreciation will occur, the amount by which our investment will increase in value, or the timing thereof. Any dividends received from PINE are included in Investment Income on the accompanying statement of operations.\nPrior to 2019, the Company operated in four primary business segments: income properties, commercial loan investments, real estate operations, and golf operations. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company commenced efforts to monetize the golf operations and accordingly, as of December 31, 2018, the golf assets and liabilities related to the golf operations were classified as held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the results of golf operations were classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for all years presented. The golf operations segment, although discontinued in 2018, held assets as of December 31, 2018. Accordingly, the identifiable assets and liabilities have been disclosed separately as discontinued golf operations for the years presented.\nAs a result of the significant transactions during the fourth quarter of 2019, including the Land JV transaction, the PINE Income Property Sale Transactions, and the Golf Sale, the Company's segment structure has been modified to more closely align with the continuing operations of the Company. The Company now operates in four primary business segments: income properties, management services, commercial loan investments, and real estate operations. The new management services segment consists of the revenue generated from managing PINE and the Land JV. The management services segment had no assets as of December 31, 2019, 2018, or 2017. The real estate operations segment previously included land sales from the Daytona Beach land portfolio as well as revenue and expenses related to the sale of mitigation credits and subsurface operations. Upon the completion of the Land JV transaction in the fourth quarter of 2019, the real estate operations related to land sales have been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 and the continuing real estate operations segment remaining consists of subsurface operations and mitigation credit sales. The identifiable assets and liabilities related to the discontinued real estate operations have been separately disclosed as discontinued real estate operations for the years presented.\n\t\t\nThe

focused on investing in income-producing real estate, primarily multi-tenant commercial retail properties occupied by retail or office tenants. We may also self-develop multi-tenant income properties, as we have done in the past. We may also invest in commercial loans or similar financings secured by commercial real estate. Our investment in multi-tenant income properties, and possibly single-tenant net lease assets that fall outside our Exclusivity and ROFO agreement with PINE, may utilize proceeds from the sale of an income property currently in our portfolio and because our tax basis in property likely carries a tax basis from the low-basis land parcel we sold to by the existing property, we may seek to have the sale of the existing income property qualify for income tax deferral through the like-kind exchange provisions under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code. The low tax basis in our income property portfolio is the result of us having acquired the original land primarily in the early part of our 100 plus year history. Utilizing the like-kind exchange structure allows us to continue to defer the related income taxes on the original gains from the land sales and possibly the gains achieved on the sale of the original replacement property or properties. Generally, in order to utilize the like-kind exchange structure, we are prohibited from engaging in activities that are typically indicative of the developer of an income property or a dealer in income property sales. Our approach in investing in income-producing real estate is to use leverage, when appropriate or necessary, to fund our acquisitions and to help achieve our business objectives. Our use of leverage in acquiring income-producing real estate is intended to provide positive returns relative to our borrowing costs. We believe this enhances our Company's income-generating real estate asset base while keeping us cash flow positive.\nOur investment strategy seeks to acquire income properties, primarily multi-tenants, which will continue to broaden the credit base of our lease tenants, diversify our income property portfolio geographically, with an emphasis on major markets and growth markets in the U.S., and diversify the type of income-producing property. We may selectively choose to complete the development of an income property investment.\n\t\t\nProceeds from completed sales of income properties supply us with investible capital. Our access to sources of debt financing, particularly our borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility, also provide a source of capital for our investment strategy. Our strategy is to utilize leverage, when appropriate and necessary, and potentially proceeds from sales of income properties, the disposition or payoffs of our commercial loan investments, and certain transactions involving our Subsurface Interests, to acquire income properties. We may also acquire or originate commercial loan investments, invest in securities of real estate companies, or make other shorter-term investments. Our targeted investment classes may include the following:\nTable 108: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMulti-tenant office and retail properties in major metropolitan areas and growth markets, typically stabilized;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSingle-tenant retail and office, double or triple net leased, properties in major metropolitan areas and growth markets that are compliant with our commitments under the Exclusivity and ROFO agreement;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPurchase or origination of ground leases, that are compliant with our commitments under the Exclusivity and ROFO agreement;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSelf-developed properties comprised of select office, flex, industrial, and retail;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nJoint venture development using land owned by the Land JV;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOrigination or purchase of commercial loan investments with loan terms of 1-10 years with strong risk-adjusted yields secured by property types to include hotel, office, retail, residential, land and industrial;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSelect regional area investments using Company market knowledge and expertise to earn strong risk-adjusted yields; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nReal estate-related investment securities, including commercial mortgage-backed securities, preferred or common stock, and corporate bonds.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur investments in income-producing properties are typically subject to long-term leases. For multi-tenant properties, each tenant typically pays its proportionate share of the aforementioned operating expenses of the property, although for such properties we typically incur additional costs for property management services. Single-tenant leases are typically in the form of triple or double net leases and ground leases. Triple-net leases generally require the tenant to pay property operating expenses such as real estate taxes, insurance, assessments and other governmental fees, utilities, repairs and maintenance, and capital expenditures.\nINCOME PROPERTIES\nWe have pursued a strategy of investing in income-producing properties, when possible, by utilizing the proceeds from real estate transactions, including the disposition of income properties and transactions involving our Subsurface Interests.\nOur strategy for investing in income-producing properties is focused on factors including, but not limited to, long-term real estate fundamentals and target markets, including major markets or those markets experiencing significant economic growth. We employ a methodology for evaluating targeted investments in income-producing properties which includes an evaluation of: (i) the attributes of the real estate (e.g. location, market demographics, comparable properties in the market, etc.); (ii) an evaluation of the existing tenant(s) (e.g. credit-worthiness, property level sales, tenant rent levels compared to the market, etc.); (iii) other market-specific conditions (e.g. tenant industry, job and population growth in the market, local economy, etc.); and (iv) considerations relating to the Company's business and strategy (e.g. strategic fit of the asset type, property management needs, alignment with the Company's 1031 like-kind exchange structure, etc.).\nWe believe investment in each of these income-producing asset classes provides attractive opportunities for stable current cash flows and increased returns in the long run and the potential for capital appreciation.\n\t\t\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company acquired ten single-tenant income properties and one multi-tenant income property, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $164.7 million as described below:\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTenant Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTenant Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nProperty Location\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDate of Acquisition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nProperty Square-Feet\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nProperty Acres\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPurchase Price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercentage Leased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRemaining Lease Term at Acquisition Date (in years)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nHobby Lobby Stores, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSingle-Tenant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWinston-Salem, NC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n05/16/19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n55,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n8,075,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n24 Hour Fitness USA, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSingle-Tenant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFalls Church, VA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n05/23/19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n46,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n21,250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWalgreen Co.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSingle-Tenant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBirmingham, AL\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n06/05/19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9.8\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFamily Dollar Stores of Massachusetts, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSingle-Tenant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLynn, MA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n06/07/19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.8\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWalgreen Co.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSingle-Tenant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAlbany, GA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n06/21/19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,634,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCarpenter Hotel (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSingle-Tenant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAustin, TX\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n07/05/19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nN/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n16,250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n99.1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeneral Dynamics Corporation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSingle-Tenant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nReston, VA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n07/12/19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n64,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18,600,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9.9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLive Nation Entertainment, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSingle-Tenant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEast Troy, WI\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n08/30/19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nN/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n158.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nParty City Corporation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSingle-Tenant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOceanside, NY\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n09/24/19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,120,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBurlington Stores, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSingle-Tenant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nN.

Pursuant to FASB ASC Topic 842, Leases, the $16.25 million investment has been recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 as a commercial loan investment. See Note 4, Commercial Loan Investments\u201d.\nIn addition to the 20 single-tenant net lease properties sold to PINE in November 2019, the Company completed the sale of four other income properties during the year ended December 31, 2019. In February 2019, the Company sold its approximately 59,000 square foot multi-tenant retail property located in Sarasota, Florida that was anchored by a Whole Foods Market grocery store, for approximately $24.6 million. In May 2019, the Company sold its approximately 112,000 square foot retail strip center, anchored by a 24-Hour Fitness, for approximately $18.3 million. In June 2019, the Company sold its approximately 76,000 square foot multi-tenant office property in Santa Clara, California for approximately $37 million. And finally, in August of 2019, the Company sold its property that was subject to a ground lease with WaWa for approximately $2.8 million. In aggregate, the four dispositions generated approximately $82.6 million in proceeds with gains recognized of approximately $20.8 million, or approximately $3.06 per share, after tax.\nOur current portfolio of twenty-nine (29) single-tenant income properties generates approximately $20.4 million of revenues from straight-line base lease payments on an annualized basis and had a weighted average remaining lease term of 9.1 years as of December 31, 2019. Our current portfolio of five (5) multi-tenant properties generates approximately $8.9 million of revenue from straight-line base lease payments on an annualized basis and had a weighted average remaining lease term of 6.5 years as of December 31, 2019.\nAs part of our overall strategy for investing in income-producing properties, we have self-developed properties, including five multi-tenant office properties, all of which are located in Daytona Beach, Florida. We sold one these properties in 2016 and the four other properties on March 26, 2018.\nWe also self-developed two single-tenant net lease restaurant properties on a 6-acre beachfront parcel in Daytona Beach, Florida. The development was completed in January of 2018 and rent commenced from both tenants pursuant to their separate leases. On a limited basis, we have acquired and may continue to selectively acquire other real estate, either vacant land or land with existing structures, that we would demolish and develop into additional income properties, possibly in the downtown and beachside areas of Daytona Beach, Florida. Through December 31, 2019, we invested approximately $5.2 million to acquire approximately 6.0 acres in downtown Daytona Beach that is located in an opportunity zone. Specifically, our investments in the Daytona Beach area would target opportunistic acquisitions of select catalyst sites, which are typically distressed, with an objective of having short investment horizons. Should we pursue such acquisitions, we may seek to partner with developers to develop these sites rather than self-develop the properties.\nOur focus on acquiring income-producing investments includes a continual review of our existing income property portfolio to identify opportunities to recycle our capital through the sale of income properties based on, among other possible factors, the current or expected performance of the property and favorable market conditions. In the recent past, the Company was pursuing an effort to the monetize certain of our multi-tenant income properties with the Company intending to reinvest the potential proceeds from these dispositions into single-tenant net lease income properties. As a result of that strategy, we sold three multi-tenant income properties during the year ended December 31, 2019. In part, as a result of entering into the Exclusivity and ROFO Agreement, our income property investment strategy will be focused primarily on multi-tenant retail and office properties. We may pursue this strategy, in part, by monetizing certain of our\n\t\t\nsingle-tenant properties, and should we do so, we would seek to utilize the 1031 like-kind exchange structure to preserve the tax-deferred gain on the original transaction(s) that pertains to the replacement asset.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company owned twenty-nine single-tenant and five multi-tenant income properties in eleven states.

had one tenant that accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated income property revenue during the year ended December 31, 2019. Wells Fargo, who occupied two single-tenant office properties located in Hillsboro, Oregon and Raleigh, North Carolina, accounted for approximately 12.5% of our consolidated revenues during the year ended December 31, 2019. The office property leased to Wells Fargo located in Hillsboro, Oregon was sold as a part of the PINE Income Property Sale Transactions on November 26, 2019. The office property leased to Wells Fargo located in Raleigh, North Carolina also represented 26% of the total square footage of our income property portfolio as of December 31, 2019. A default by this tenant would have a material adverse effect on the Company's income properties segment and its overall results of operations. We have one other tenant, Fidelity Investments, who represented over 5% of our consolidated revenues during the year ended December 31, 2019, and a large percentage of the square footage of our income property portfolio, but not in excess of 10%.\nMANAGEMENT SERVICES BUSINESS\nOur business plans also include generating revenue from managing PINE and the Land JV. Pursuant to the Management Agreement, we will generate a base management fee equal to 1.5% of PINE's total equity. The structure of the base fee provides us with an opportunity for our base fee to grow should PINE's independent board members determine to raise additional equity capital in the future. We also have an opportunity to achieve additional cash flows as Manager of PINE pursuant to the terms of the incentive fee.\nThe Company also generates management fees as the Land JV Manager. Pursuant to the terms of the operating agreement for the Land JV, the initial amount of the management fee is $20,000 per month. The management fee is evaluated quarterly and as land sales occur in the Land JV, the basis for our management fee will be reduced as the management fee is based on the value of real property that remains in the Land JV.\nCOMMERCIAL LOAN INVESTMENTS\nOur investments in commercial loans or similar structured finance investments, such as mezzanine loans or other subordinated debt, have been and are expected to continue to be secured by commercial or residential real estate or the borrower's pledge of its ownership interest in the entity that owns the real estate. The first mortgage loans we invest in or originate are generally for commercial real estate located in the United States and its territories and are current or performing with either a fixed or floating rate. Some of these loans may be syndicated in either a pari-passu or senior/subordinated structure. Commercial first mortgage loans generally provide for a higher recovery rate due to their senior position in the underlying collateral. Commercial mezzanine loans are typically secured by a pledge of the borrower's equity ownership in the underlying commercial real estate. Unlike a mortgage, a mezzanine loan is not secured\n\t\t\nby a lien on the property. An investor's rights in a mezzanine loan are usually governed by an intercreditor agreement that provides holders with the rights to cure defaults and exercise control on certain decisions of any senior debt secured by the same commercial property.\n2019 Commercial Loan Investment Portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company invested approximately $18.3 million on three commercial loans, two were mortgage notes of $8 million and $8.25 million secured by a parcel of land in Orlando, Florida and a full-service hotel in Austin, Texas, respectively. In addition, in connection with the sale of the Company's golf operations, the Company provided an approximately $2.1 million loan to the buyer, with a maturity of one year and an interest rate of 7.5%. As of December 31, 2019, the Company's commercial loan investment portfolio included the three loans with a total remaining principal balance of approximately $18.2 million, a weighted average interest rate of approximately 11.3% and a remaining duration to maturity of approximately 0.5 years.\n2018 Commercial Loan Investment Portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company had two loan investments totaling approximately $11.9 million, that were repaid in full at maturity. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had no commercial loan investments.\n2017 Commercial Loan Investment Portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company invested in a $3 million loan on a parcel of land in Daytona Beach that was being developed into a multi-family condominium property. As of December 31, 2017, the Company's commercial loan investment portfolio included two loans with a total remaining principal balance of approximately $11.9 million, a weighted average interest rate of 9.5% and a remaining duration to maturity of approximately 0.5 years. During the year a $10 million mezzanine loan investment secured by a hotel located at the Dallas/Fort Worth airport in Texas and a $5 million mezzanine loan investment secured by a hotel located in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, were paid off in full.\nLAND and INVESTMENT IN THE LAND JV\nLand JV. As noted above, the direct impact of the Magnetar Land Sale is that the Company divested itself of its land holdings, but for the 6-acre Daytona Beach development land described below, and as such the occurrence of land sales, which had been a primary element of the Company's business for virtually its entire 109-year history, has been essentially discontinued. Consequently, the operations associated with our land holdings were treated as discontinued operations and accordingly the revenues and expenses that had been presented within the Company's real estate operations segment in prior periods were reclassified in the statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 and all prior periods presented.\nHowever, the Company is continuing to pursue land sales on the approximately 5,300 acres that formerly comprised its land holdings in its role as Manager (of the Land JV) on behalf of the JV Partners. The Company's retained interest in the Land JV represents a notional 33.5% stake in the venture, the value of which may be realized in the form of distributions based on the timing and the amount of proceeds achieved when the land is ultimately sold by the Land JV. As of March 6, 2020, the Land JV has completed approximately $22 million in land sales since its inception in mid-October 2019 and currently has a pipeline of 10 purchase and sale agreements for potential land sale transactions representing approximately $97 million of potential proceeds to the Land JV. The 4,200 acres under contract represents approximately 84% of the total remaining land in the Land JV.\nDaytona Beach Development. We may selectively acquire other real estate in Daytona Beach, Florida. We may target either vacant land or land with existing structures that we would raze and develop into additional income properties. During 2018, the Company acquired a 5-acre parcel of land with existing structures in downtown Daytona Beach, for a purchase price of approximately $2.0 million. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has also acquired other contiguous parcels totaling approximately 1-acre for approximately $2.1 million. Combined, these parcels represent the substantial portion of an entire city block in downtown Daytona Beach adjacent to International Speedway Boulevard, a major thoroughfare in Daytona Beach. The combined 6 acres is located in an opportunity zone and a community redevelopment area. In addition, this property is proximate to the future headquarters of Brown & Brown Inc., the sixth largest insurance broker in the U.S. and a publicly listed company that is expected to be occupied by at least 600 of their employees. We have engaged a national real estate brokerage firm to assist us in identifying a developer or investor to acquire a portion or all of the property or to contribute into a potential joint venture to redevelop the property. We are pursuing entitlements for the potential redevelopment of these parcels, along with certain other adjacent land parcels, some of which we have under contract for purchase. As of December 31, 2019, we have incurred approximately $1.1 million in raze and entitlement costs related to these parcels. Our intent for investments in the Daytona Beach area is to target opportunistic acquisitions\n\t\t\nof select catalyst sites, which are typically distressed, with the objective of short-to-medium investment horizons. We may enter into joint ventures or other partnerships to develop land we have acquired or may acquire in the future in lieu of self-developing.\nRevenue from Tomoka Town Center. During 2015 and 2016, the Company completed three land sales with a gross sales price totaling approximately $21.4 million, with Tanger Outlets ( Tanger\u201d), Sam's Club ( Sams\u201d), and North American Development Group ( NADG\u201d), representing the sale of approximately 235 acres of land that is now the location of a Tanger Outlet mall, a Sam's Club retail property and a retail power center called the Tomoka Town Center. As part of the three land sale agreements and subsequent land sales with NADG, the Company performed certain infrastructure work, which began in the fourth quarter of 2015 and was completed in the fourth quarter of 2016, for which the Company would be reimbursed for the cost of the infrastructure work. The Company received NADG's portion of the reimbursement as NADG closed on each parcel of land included in the respective land sales contracts with the Company. Tanger and Sam's agreed to pay their reimbursement of the infrastructure costs over a ten-year period. The reimbursements applicable to and due from Tanger and Sam's totaled approximately $2.8 million. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has received approximately $1.1 million of the Tanger and Sam's reimbursements. These reimbursements are included in the results of the land operations which are now reflected in discontinued operations and will be through the final payment of Tanger's and Sam's reimbursement obligation.\nSince the transition in our land operations occurred late in 2019, the impact of land sales for the periods prior to October 2019 are no longer germane to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As such the following summarized information is provided regarding land sales activity prior to October 2019.\n2019 Land Sales. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company completed five (5) land sales transactions, including: (i) the Magnetar Land Sale for approximately 5,300 acres of land, for total proceeds of approximately $97 million; (ii) two transactions with Unicorp Development representing approximately 23.6 acres and generating aggregate proceeds of approximately $7.1 million; (iii) the sale of approximately 38 acres for total proceeds of $710,000, and (iv) a land sale to NADG for approximately 13 acres generating proceeds of approximately $3 million. In total the Company, in 2019, sold approximately 5,400 acres generating proceeds of approximately $108 million. Including the approximately $48.9 million recognized on the retained interest in the Land JV, gains of approximately $133 million, or approximately $20.60 per share after tax, were recognized.\n2018 Land Sales. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company completed land transactions representing approximately 2,697 acres including: (i) the sale of a 70% interest in the Mitigation Bank (hereinafter defined) that holds approximately 2,492 acres for proceeds of $15.3 million and (ii) twelve land sales totaling approximately 205 acres for aggregate proceeds of approximately $43.7 million. The twelve land sales generated gains of approximately $32.6 million, or approximately $4.44 per share, after tax.\n2017 Land Sales. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company completed land transactions representing approximately 1,700 acres including: (i) the sale of nearly 1,600 acres to Minto Communities generating proceeds of approximately $27.2 million; (ii) two transactions with NADG of approximately 46 acres for total proceeds of approximately $10.6 million, and (iii) five other transactions representing approximately 73.5 acres that generated approximately $9.2 million of proceeds. The land sales in 2017 generated aggregate proceeds of approximately $45.5 million and gains of approximately $31.8 million, or approximately $3.51 per share, after tax.\nLand Impairments. As more fully described in Note 11, \"Impairment of Long-Lived Assets,\" during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company did not recognize any impairments on its undeveloped land holdings.\nMitigation Bank. The mitigation bank transaction consists of the sale of a 70% interest in the entity that holds approximately 2,492 acres of land that has been permitted for the creation of a wetland mitigation bank (the Mitigation Bank JV\u201d). The purchaser of the 70% interest in the Mitigation Bank JV is comprised of certain funds and accounts managed by an investment advisor subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. ( BlackRock\u201d). The Company retained an approximately 30% non-controlling interest in the Mitigation Bank JV. A third-party was retained by the Mitigation Bank JV as the day-to-day manager of the Mitigation Bank property, responsible for the maintenance, generation, tracking, and other aspects of wetland mitigation credits.\n\t\t\nThe Mitigation Bank JV intends to engage in the creation and sale of both federal and state wetland mitigation credits. These credits will be created pursuant to the applicable permits that have been or will be issued to the Mitigation Bank JV from the federal and state regulatory agencies that exercise jurisdiction over the awarding of such credits, but no assurances can be given as to the ultimate issuance, marketability or value of the credits. The Mitigation Bank JV received the permit from the state regulatory agency on June 8, 2018 (the State Permit\u201d). The state regulatory agency may award up to 355 state credits under the State Permit. On August 6, 2018, the state regulatory agency awarded the initial 88.84 credits under the State Permit. Receipt of the remaining federal permit is anticipated to occur prior to the end of 2020.\nThe gain on the sale of the 70% interest in the Mitigation Bank totaled approximately $18.4 million and is comprised of the gain on the sale of 70% interest for proceeds of $15.3 million as well as the gain on the retained 30% interest pursuant to FASB ASC Topic 610-20, Other Income - Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets. The gain is included in the Gain on Disposition of Assets in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2018, the approximately $6.8 million Investments in Joint Ventures included on the Company's consolidated balance sheets is comprised of the fair market value of the 30% retained interest in the Mitigation Bank JV.\nThe operating agreement of the Mitigation Bank JV (the Operating Agreement\u201d) executed in conjunction with the mitigation bank transaction stipulates that the Company shall arrange for sales of the Mitigation Bank JV's mitigation credits to unrelated third parties totaling no less than $6 million of revenue to the Mitigation Bank JV, net of commissions, by the end of 2020, utilizing a maximum of 60 mitigation credits (the Minimum Sales Requirement\u201d). The Operating Agreement stipulates that if the Minimum Sales Requirement is not achieved, then BlackRock has the right, but is not required, to cause the Company to purchase the number of mitigation credits necessary to reach the Minimum Sales Requirement (the Minimum Sales Guarantee\u201d). The Company estimates the fair value of the Minimum Sales Guarantee to be approximately $100,000 which was recorded as a reduction in the gain on the transaction and is included in Accrued and Other Liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018.\nAdditionally, the Operating Agreement provides BlackRock the right to cause the Company to purchase a maximum of 8.536 mitigation credits per quarter (the Commitment Amount\u201d) from the Mitigation Bank JV at a price equal to 60% of the then fair market value for mitigation credits (the Put Right\u201d). The Put Right is applicable even if the Mitigation Bank JV has not yet been awarded a sufficient number of mitigation credits by the applicable federal and state regulatory agencies. Further, in any quarter that BlackRock does not exercise its Put Right, the unexercised Commitment Amount for the applicable quarter may be rolled over to future calendar quarters. However, the Operating Agreement also stipulates that any amount of third-party sales of mitigation credits will reduce the Put Rights outstanding on a one-for-one basis, if the sales price of the third-party sales equals or exceeds the prices stipulated by the Put Right. Further, any sales of mitigation credits to third parties at the requisite minimum prices in a quarter that exceeds the quarterly amount of the Put Right will reduce the Put Rights in future calendar quarters on a one-for-one basis. The maximum potential of future payments for the Company pursuant to the Put Right is approximately $27 million. The Company estimates the fair value of the Put Right to be approximately $200,000, which was recorded as a reduction in the gain on the transaction and is included in Accrued and Other Liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018. In December 2019, BlackRock exercised its Put Right and put 25 mitigation credits to the Company, which the Company purchased for approximately $1.9 million, or approximately $75,000 per credit. The credits acquired were included as an increase to Impact Fees and Mitigation Credits on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2019.\nOther Real Estate Assets. The Company owns mitigation credits with a cost basis of approximately $2.3 million as of December 31, 2019. The increase in mitigation credits includes the 25 credits acquired from the Mitigation Bank during December 2019 as described in Note 6, Land and Investments in the Land JV. There were no mitigation credit sales during the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company transferred mitigation credits with a basis of approximately $124,000 to the land acquired by Buc-ee's. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company sold mitigation credits for approximately $1.0 million, for a gain of approximately $882,000, or $0.12 per share, after tax. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company sold mitigation credits for approximately $1.6 million, for a gain of approximately $1.3 million, or $0.15 per share, after tax. Additionally, the Company recorded the transfer of mitigation credits with a cost basis of approximately $298,000 as a charge to direct cost of revenues of real estate operations during the year ended December 31, 2017, as more fully described in Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company received cash payments of approximately $338,000 and $519,000, respectively, for impact fees with a cost basis that was generally of equal value, with no such impact fee sales during the year ended December 31, 2019, as the balance of impact fees is only approximately $2,000. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2018, impact fees with a cost basis of approximately $72,000 were transferred to the beachfront restaurant leased to LandShark Bar & Grill.\n\t\t\nSubsurface Interests. As of December 31, 2019, the Company owns full or fractional subsurface oil, gas, and mineral interests underlying approximately 455,000 surface\u201d acres of land owned by others in 20 counties in Florida (the Subsurface Interests\u201d). The revenues generated by the portfolio of subsurface interests includes the sale of subsurface acres, the leasing of subsurface acres for mineral exploration activities, and payments made to the Company, typically by the owner of the surface acres, to compensate us for releasing our right to enter the surface acres to access our subsurface acres.\nPrior to September 2019, the Company leased certain of the Subsurface Interests to a mineral exploration organization for exploration. An eight-year oil exploration lease was executed in 2011 that covered a portion of our Subsurface Interests. On September 20, 2017, the Company amended the oil exploration lease to, among other things, extend the expiration of the original term for five additional years to the new expiration date of September 22, 2024. As a result, the lease was effectively comprised of thirteen one-year terms as the lessee had the option to terminate the lease at the end of each lease year. The lessee had previously exercised renewal options through the eighth year of the lease which ended on September 22, 2019. The Lessee elected not to renew the oil exploration lease beyond September 22, 2019. During the eight years the lease was active the annual lease payments were recognized as revenue ratably over the respective twelve-month lease period. During the lease term a number of the renewals included the payment of a drilling penalty by the Lessee. The non-refundable drilling penalty payments were recognized as revenue when earned, i.e. when the amount agreed upon was paid. Lease income generated by the annual lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the guaranteed lease term. For the years December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, lease income of approximately $598,000, approximately $807,000, and approximately $807,000 was recognized, respectively.\nLease payments on the respective acreages and drilling penalties received through lease year eight are as follows:\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAcreage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLease Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Approximate)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFlorida County\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLease Payment (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDrilling Penalty (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLease Year 1 - 9/23/2011 - 9/22/2012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n136,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLee and Hendry\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n913,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLease Year 2 - 9/23/2012 - 9/22/2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n136,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLee and Hendry\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n922,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLease Year 3 - 9/23/2013 - 9/22/2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n82,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nHendry\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,293,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,000,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLease Year 4 - 9/23/2014 - 9/22/2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n42,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nHendry\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,866,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n600,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLease Year 5 - 9/23/2015 - 9/22/2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n25,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nHendry\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,218,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n175,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLease Year 6 - 9/23/2016 - 9/22/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nHendry\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n806,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n150,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLease Year 7 - 9/23/2017 - 9/22/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nHendry\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n806,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n50,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLease Year 8 - 9/23/2018 - 9/22/2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nHendry\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n806,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n150,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n10,633,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,125,000\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nGenerally, cash payment for the Lease Payment and Drilling Penalty is received on or before the first day of the lease year. The Drilling Penalty, which is due within thirty days from the end of the prior lease year, is recorded as revenue when earned, i.e. when the amount is agreed upon, while the Lease Payment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective lease term. The oil exploration lease has not been renewed beyond September 22, 2019 and has effectively terminated.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThere were no sales of subsurface acres during the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company sold approximately 38,750 acres of subsurface interests in Osceola County, Florida for approximately $2.1 million (the \"Osceola Subsurface Sale\"). The gain from the Osceola Subsurface Sale totaled approximately $2.08 million, or $0.23 per share, after tax.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company completed a transaction releasing our surface entry rights on approximately 600 acres in exchange for approximately $185,000 in cash and fee title to approximately 40 additional acres in Hendry County, valued at approximately $320,000. Including the non-cash value received, the gain from the transaction totaled approximately $435,000, or $0.06 per share, after tax. Additional cash payments for the release of surface entry rights during 2018 totaled approximately $73,000. The revenue from the release of surface entry rights during the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled approximately $2.1 million.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, the Company also received oil royalties from operating oil wells on 800 acres under a separate lease with a separate operator resulting in revenues received from oil royalties of approximately $42,000, $72,000, and $86,000, respectively.\n\t\t\nThe Company is not prohibited from selling any or all of its Subsurface Interests. The Company may release surface entry rights or other rights upon request of a surface owner for a negotiated release fee typically based on a percentage of the surface value. Should the Company complete a transaction to sell all or a portion of its Subsurface Interests or complete a release transaction, the Company may utilize the like-kind exchange structure in acquiring one or more replacement investments including income-producing properties. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company completed a transaction releasing our surface entry rights on approximately 600 acres in exchange for approximately $185,000 in cash and fee title to approximately 40 additional acres in Hendry County, valued at approximately $320,000. Including the non-cash value received, the gain from the transaction totaled approximately $435,000, or $0.06 per share, after tax. Additional cash payments for the release of surface entry rights during 2018 totaled approximately $73,000. Cash payments for the release of surface entry rights totaled approximately $104,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019, while there were no releases of surface entry rights during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nGOLF OPERATIONS\nThe Golf Sale closed in October 2019. Prior to October 2019, the Company owned the LPGA International Golf Club (the Club\u201d), a semi-private golf club consisting of two 18-hole championship golf courses, a three-hole practice facility, a clubhouse facility with food and beverage operations, and a fitness facility. The Club was managed by a third party.\nPrior to January 2017, the Company leased from the City of Daytona Beach, FL (the City\u201d) a large portion of the land underlying the Club (the Golf Course Lease\u201d). On January 24, 2017, the Company acquired the approximately 690 acres of land and improvements covered by the Golf Course Lease, for approximately $1.5 million (the Golf Course Land Purchase\u201d). In conjunction with the Golf Course Land Purchase, the Golf Course Lease was terminated. Therefore, during the first quarter of 2017, the Company eliminated the remaining accrued liability of approximately $2.2 million, resulting in the recognition of approximately $0.40 per share in non-cash earnings, or $0.24 per share after tax, which comprises the Golf Course Lease termination in the consolidated statements of operations. The $2.2 million consisted of approximately $1.7 million which reflects the acceleration of the remaining amount of accrued rent that was no longer owed to the City as a result of the Lease Amendment, which prior to the Golf Course Land Purchase was being recognized into income over the remaining lease term which was originally to expire in 2022. The remaining approximately $500,000 reflects the amount of rent accrued pursuant to the Golf Course Lease, as amended, which will no longer be owed to the City due to the lease termination on January 24, 2017.\nAs a part of the Golf Course Land Purchase, the Company donated to the City three land parcels totaling approximately 14.3 acres located on the west side of Interstate 95. The Company had a cost basis of effectively $0 in the donated land and paid approximately $100,000 to satisfy the community development district bonds associated with the acreage. As part of the Golf Course Land Purchase the Company was obligated to pay the City additional consideration in the form of an annual surcharge of $1 per golf round played at the Club each year (the Per-Round Surcharge\u201d) with an annual minimum Per-Round Surcharge of $70,000 and a maximum aggregate amount of the Per-Round Surcharges paid equal to $700,000. The maximum amount of $700,000 represents contingent consideration and was recorded as an increase in Golf Buildings, Improvements, and Equipment and Accrued and Other Liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In connection with the Golf Sale the Company paid off the remaining obligation which totaled $560,000. The Company also, as part of the Golf Course Land Purchase, was required to renovate the greens on one of the courses at the Club and such renovations were completed in the third quarter of 2017.\nThe Golf Course Land Purchase also required that if the Company sold the Club within six years of the closing of the Golf Course Land Purchase, the Company would be obligated to pay the City an amount equal to 10% of the difference between the sales price, less closing costs and any other costs required to be incurred in connection with the sale, and $4.0 million. Based on the sales price of the Golf Sale, the Company's obligation under this provision terminated.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company wrote down the value of the golf assets comprising the Club, which resulted in a corresponding impairment charge of approximately $1.1 million, or $0.15 per share, after tax. The write-down of the golf operation assets to approximately $3.1 million and the related $1.1 million impairment charge were the result of the Company's assessment of certain triggering events, including activities related to a review of strategic alternatives for the golf operations, occurring during the third quarter of 2018, which required an assessment of the carrying value of the golf assets comprising the Club. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company commenced efforts to pursue the monetization of the golf operations and assets comprising the Club. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2018 and during 2019, prior to the date of the Golf Sale, the golf assets comprising the Club were classified as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets and the results of golf operations were similarly reclassified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income for the period presented.\n\t\t\nSUMMARY OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO DECEMBER 31, 2018\nREVENUE\nTotal revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 is presented in the following summary and indicates the changes as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018:\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenue for the\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncrease (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nVs.

The slight increase in total revenue reflects the net impact of an increase in revenue from our income property operations of approximately $1.88 million, which is the result of an increase in revenue of approximately $8.5 million from acquisitions during the year and a decrease relating to our dispositions of income properties during the year ended December 31, 2019 which totaled approximately $5.3 million. In addition, our revenues increased by approximately $300,000 in connection with the management fees we earned from PINE during its initial stub period of operations (from November 26, 2019 through December 31, 2019) and total revenues increased by approximately $1.2 million based on the increase in revenue generated by our commercial loan portfolio. These increases were offset by a decrease of approximately $2.1 million in the revenue we generated from our real estate operations segment, which does not include any results of the land sales we achieved in 2019, which pertains to the termination of the subsurface lease as well as a decrease of approximately $1.3 million in impact fee and mitigation credit sales.\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenue for the\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncrease (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nVs.

The direct costs of revenues for our income property operations totaled approximately $7.0 million and $8.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in revenues of approximately $1.9 million, or 5%, during the year ended December 31, 2019 reflects our expanded portfolio of income properties including increases of approximately $8.5 million due to recent acquisitions, offset by the decrease of approximately $5.3 million related to properties we sold during 2019. Revenue from our income properties during years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 also includes approximately $2.4 million in revenue from the accretion of the below-market lease intangible, of which a significant portion is attributable to the property located in Raleigh, North Carolina, leased to Wells Fargo ( Wells Fargo Raleigh\u201d). Our increased operating income from our income property operations reflects increased rent revenues and a decrease of approximately $1.2 million in our direct costs of revenues which was primarily comprised of approximately $215,000 in increased operating expenses related to our recent acquisitions, offset by the reduction in operating expenses related to the recent PINE Income Property Sale Transactions and Multi-Tenant Dispositions.\nMANAGEMENT SERVICES\nRevenue from our management services totaled approximately $0.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 with none recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company earned management services revenue from PINE of approximately $254,000 which represents the initial stub period of PINE's operations from November 26, 2019 to December 31, 2019 and approximately $50,000 from the Land JV which represents the initial stub period of the Land JV's operations from October 16, 2019 to December 31, 2019.\n\t\t\nCOMMERCIAL LOAN INVESTMENTS\nInterest income from our commercial loan investments totaled approximately $1.8 million and $616,000 during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase is primarily attributable to investment in three commercial loans during 2019 totaling approximately $18.3 million and with a weighted-average interest rate of 11.3%.\nREAL ESTATE OPERATIONS\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, operating income from real estate operations was approximately $748,000 on revenues totaling approximately $852,000. During the year ended December 31, 2018, operating income was approximately $2.4 million on revenues totaling approximately $3.0 million. The decrease in revenue of approximately $2.1 million and operating income of approximately $1.6 million is primarily attributable to the decrease in the subsurface revenue and impact fee and mitigation credit sales revenue of approximately $877,000 and $1.3 million, respectively. The decrease of approximately $486,000 in direct costs of real estate operations is primarily the result of the reduction of cost basis in the impact fees and the mitigation credits sold in December 31, 2018.\nGENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER CORPORATE EXPENSES\nTotal general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 is presented in the following summary and indicates the changes as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018:\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nG&A Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Increase) Decrease\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nVs.

While total general and administrative expenses for the year in 2019 were relatively flat compared to the same period in 2018, recurring general and administrative expense increased approximately $149,000 while the costs associated with certain shareholder matters was down approximately $881,000. Non-cash stock compensation increased by approximately $765,000 which was due to the Company's third year of performance share awards and a grant of stock to our directors in January of 2019.\nGAINS ON DISPOSITION OF ASSETS AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES\nWe recognized gains on dispositions of approximately $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 which was approximately the same amount we recognized on gains from dispositions in the same period of 2018.\nThe gains recognized for the year ended December 31, 2019 included the gain of approximately $1.0 million we recognized from the sale of 20 single-tenant net lease properties to PINE in November 2019. In addition, the Company completed the sale of four other income properties during the year ended December 31, 2019. In February 2019, the Company sold its approximately 59,000 square foot multi-tenant retail property located in Sarasota, Florida that was anchored by a Whole Foods Market grocery store, for approximately $24.6 million. In May 2019, the Company sold its approximately 112,000 square foot retail strip center, anchored by a 24-Hour Fitness, for approximately $18.3 million. In June 2019 the Company sold its approximately 76,000 square foot two-tenant office property in Santa Clara, California for approximately $37 million. And finally, in August of 2019, the Company sold its property that was subject to a ground lease with WaWa for approximately $2.8 million. In aggregate, the four dispositions generated approximately $82.6 million in proceeds with gains recognized of approximately $20.8 million, or approximately $3.06 per share, after tax.\n\t\t\nDISCONTINUED REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenue for the\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncrease (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nVs.

The transaction resulted in a gain of approximately $127.5 million, which was comprised of a gain of approximately $78.6 million, or approximately $12.21 per share, after tax, on the land sale and a non-cash gain of approximately $48.9 million on the Company's retained interest in the Land JV, or approximately $7.59 per share, after tax. The Magnetar Land Sale resulted in the Company effectively exiting the business of selling land, a major component of its business, and accordingly the Company determined that the portion of its real estate operations segment pertaining to land sales should be classified as a discontinued operation and therefore all components of the real estate operations associated with land sales should be appropriately reclassified in the statement of operations for all periods presented.\nWith regard to the revenue and direct cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 the decreases are attributable to the land sales transactions completed in 2019. In the year ended December 31, 2019 we closed five (5) land sales transactions, excluding the Magnetar Land Sale, generating proceeds of approximately $11.0 million and the recognition of the cost basis in the land plus closing costs of approximately $5.3 million. In the year ended December 31, 2018 we closed twelve (12) land sales transactions, excluding the Mitigation Bank transaction, generating proceeds of approximately $42.9 million and the recognition of the cost basis in the land plus closing costs of approximately $8.1 million\nDISCONTINUED GOLF OPERATIONS\nRevenues from golf operations totaled approximately $4.1 million and $4.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The total direct cost of golf operations revenues totaled approximately $5.3 million and $5.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As a result of treating the golf operations as a discontinued operation as of December 31, 2018, the Company did not recognize any deprecation or amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company's golf operations had a net operating loss of approximately $1.2 million and approximately $906,000 during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, an increase in operating results of approximately $260,000.\nINTEREST EXPENSE\nInterest expense totaled approximately $12.5 million and $10.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase of approximately $2.0 million is primarily the result of increased borrowings under the Company's Credit Facility generally for income property acquisitions and our stock buyback program.\n\t\t\nSUMMARY OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 COMPARED TO DECEMBER 31, 2017\nREVENUE\nTotal revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 is presented in the following summary and indicates the changes as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017:\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenue for the\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncrease (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nVs.

The direct costs of revenues for our income property operations totaled approximately $8.2 million and $6.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in revenues of approximately $8.7 million, or 28%, during the year ended December 31, 2018 reflects our expanded portfolio of income properties including increases of approximately $7.1 million due to recent acquisitions, and an increase of approximately $2.0 million in revenue generated by the lease-up of The Grove and the rent from our two self-developed single-tenant beachfront restaurant properties that opened in January 2018 (the Beachfront Restaurants\u201d), offset by the decrease of approximately $920,000 related to the recent Self-\n\t\t\nDeveloped Properties Sale. Revenue from our income properties during years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 also includes approximately $2.4 million and $2.2 million, respectively, in revenue from the accretion of the below-market lease intangible, of which a significant portion is attributable to the property located in Raleigh, North Carolina, leased to Wells Fargo ( Wells Fargo Raleigh\u201d). Our increased operating income from our income property operations reflects increased rent revenues offset by an increase of approximately $1.3 million in our direct costs of revenues which was primarily comprised of approximately $769,000 in increased operating expenses related to our recent acquisitions and increased costs associated with The Grove and the Beachfront Restaurants, offset by the reduction in operating expenses related to the recent Self-Developed Properties Sale.\nMANAGEMENT SERVICES\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company did not have management services arrangements and did not generate management services income.\nCOMMERCIAL LOAN INVESTMENTS\nInterest income from our commercial loan investments totaled approximately $616,000 and $2.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease is primarily attributable to the sale of the Company's two mezzanine loans in October 2017. With the payoff of the approximately $9.0 million B-Note at its maturity in June 2018 and the payoff of the $3.0 million fixed rate first mortgage loan at its maturity in August 2018, no interest income was earned during the fourth quarter of 2018 as the Company holds no commercial loan investments as of December 31, 2018.\nREAL ESTATE OPERATIONS\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, operating income from real estate operations was approximately $2.4 million on revenues totaling approximately $3.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, operating income was approximately $3.8 million on revenues totaling approximately $5.2 million. The decrease in revenue of approximately $2.2 million is primarily attributable to a decrease in surface entry releases of approximately $1.5 million as well as decreases in mitigation credit and impact fee sales of a combined approximately $0.8 million. The decrease in operating income of approximately $1.4 million is attributable to the aforementioned decrease in revenues offset by a decrease in direct costs of revenues of approximately $0.8 million which is primarily the result of the decrease in mitigation credit and impact fee cost basis due to the decrease in those sales.\nGENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER CORPORATE EXPENSES\nTotal general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 is presented in the following summary and indicates the changes as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017:\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nG&A Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Increase) Decrease\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nVs.

The net decrease is primarily related to the decrease in shareholder related costs as well as recurring costs, offset by an increase in non-cash stock compensation costs.\n\t\t\nGAINS ON DISPOSITION OF ASSETS AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company completed the sale of a 70% interest in the Mitigation Bank that holds approximately 2,492 acres of land for proceeds of $15.3 million. The gain on the sale totaled approximately $18.4 million and is comprised of the gain on the sale of the 70% interest for proceeds of $15.3 million as well as the gain on the 30% interest retained.\nFour income properties were disposed of during the year ended December 31, 2018. On March 26, 2018, the Company sold its four self-developed, multi-tenant office properties located in Daytona Beach, Florida, for approximately $11.4 million (the Self-Developed Properties Sale\u201d). The sale included the 22,012 square-foot Concierge office building, the 30,720 square-foot Mason Commerce Center comprised of two office buildings, and the 15,360 square-foot Williamson Business Park office building. The gain on the sale totaled approximately $3.7 million, or approximately $0.49 per share, after tax. The Company utilized the proceeds to fund a portion of the previously acquired income property located near Portland, Oregon, leased to Wells Fargo, through a reverse 1031 like-kind exchange structure. No income properties were disposed of during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThere were no impairment charges included in continuing operations during the years ended December 31, 2018 or 2017.\nDISCONTINUED REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenue for the\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncrease (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nVs.

The write-down of the golf operation assets to approximately $3.1 million and the related $1.1 million impairment charge were the result of the Company's assessment of certain triggering events, including activities related to a review of strategic alternatives for the golf operations, occurring during the third quarter of 2018, which required an assessment of the carrying value of the golf assets comprising the Club. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company commenced efforts to pursue the monetization of the golf operations and assets comprising the Club. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the golf assets comprising the Club have been classified as held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the results of golf operations have been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the loss from golf operations, excluding capital expenditures, totaled approximately $906,000. Should the Company complete the sale of the golf operations, it could favorably impact cash flows.\nRevenues from golf operations totaled approximately $4.9 million and $5.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The total direct cost of golf operations revenues totaled approximately $5.8 million and $6.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company's golf operations had a net operating loss of approximately $906,000 and approximately $864,000 during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease in operating results of approximately $43,000.\nINTEREST EXPENSE\nInterest expense totaled approximately $10.4 million and $8.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase of approximately $1.9 million is primarily the result of increased borrowings under the Company's Credit Facility for recent acquisitions.\n\t\t\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCash totaled approximately $6.5 million at December 31, 2019. Restricted cash totaled approximately $128.4 million at December 31, 2019 of which approximately $125.7 million of cash is being held in multiple separate escrow accounts to be reinvested through the like-kind exchange structure into other income properties; approximately $746,000 is being held in an entitlement and interest reserve for the $8.0 million first mortgage loan originated in June 2019, approximately $275,000 is being held in an interest and real estate tax reserve for the $8.3 million first mortgage originated in July 2019, approximately $156,000 is being held in an escrow account related to a land transaction which closed in February 2017; approximately $261,000 is being held in a capital replacement reserve account in connection with our financing of six income properties with Wells Fargo Bank, NA ( Wells Fargo\u201d); and approximately $1.3 million is being held in a general tenant improvement reserve account with Wells Fargo in connection with our financing of the property located in Raleigh, NC leased to Wells Fargo.\nOur total cash balance at December 31, 2019, reflected cash flows provided by our operating activities totaling approximately $16.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the prior year's cash flows provided by operating activities totaling approximately $47.8 million in the same period in 2018, a decrease of approximately $31.4 million. The decrease is primarily the result of a decrease in the volume of land sales during 2019 prior to the Land JV as compared to 2018. Cash proceeds from land sales totaled approximately $10.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to approximately $40.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of approximately $30.2 million.\nOur cash flows provided by investing activities totaled approximately $103.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to cash flows used in investing activities of approximately $77.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of approximately $181.0 million. The increase is primarily the result of an increase in cash provided by the sale of income properties and the sale of equity interests in joint ventures, totaling approximately $196.5 million and $80.8 million, respectively. These increases were partially offset by the increase in cash outflows for income property acquisitions, commercial loan investments, and the acquisition of investment securities, totaling approximately $41.3 million, $34.3 million, and $15.5 million, respectively.\nOur cash flows used in financing activities totaled approximately $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of approximately $38.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of approximately $44.5 million. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities is primarily related to the increased level of stock buybacks during 2019 which totaled approximately $41.1 million, an increase of approximately $31.3 million from the same period in 2018. Additionally, net borrowings on the Credit Facility totaled approximately $38.4 million during 2019, which was a decrease of approximately $11.9 million from the same period in 2018 when we had net borrowings of approximately $50.3 million.\nLong-term debt, at face value, totaled approximately $288.7 million at December 31, 2019, representing an increase of approximately $38.4 million from the balance of approximately $250.3 million at December 31, 2018. The increase in the long-term debt was due primarily to the net draws on our credit facility of approximately $39.1 million.\n\t\t\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company's outstanding indebtedness, at face value, was as follows:\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFace\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMaturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nInterest\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nValue Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCredit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n159,845,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMay 2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n30 -day LIBOR\nplus 1.35% -1.95%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMortgage Note Payable (originated with Wells Fargo) (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n30,000,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOctober 2034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.330%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMortgage Note Payable (originated with Wells Fargo) (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n23,884,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nApril 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n30 -day LIBOR\nplus 1.90%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020, net of discount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n75,000,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMarch 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.500%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Long-Term Face Value Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n288,729,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Secured by the Company's interest in six income properties. The mortgage loan carries a fixed rate of 4.33% per annum during the first ten years of the term, and requires payments of interest only during the first ten years of the loan. After the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the loan, the cash flows, as defined in the related loan agreement, generated by the underlying six income properties must be used to pay down the principal balance of the loan until paid off or until the loan matures. The loan is fully pre-payable after the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the loan.\n(2)Secured by the Company's income property leased to Wells Fargo located in Raleigh, North Carolina. The mortgage loan has a 5-year term with two years interest only, and interest and a 25-year amortization for the balance of the term. The mortgage loan bears a variable rate of interest based on the 30-day LIBOR plus a rate of 190 basis points. The interest rate for this mortgage loan has been fixed through the use of an interest rate swap that fixed the rate at 3.17%. The mortgage loan can be prepaid at any time subject to the termination of the interest rate swap. Amortization of the principal balance began in May 2018.\nCredit Facility. The Company's revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility\u201d), with Bank of Montreal ( BMO\u201d) serving as the administrative agent for the lenders thereunder, is unsecured with regard to our income property portfolio but is guaranteed by certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company. The Credit Facility bank group is led by BMO and also includes Wells Fargo and Branch Banking & Trust Company. On September 7, 2017, the Company executed the second amendment and restatement of the Credit Facility (the 2017 Amended Credit Facility\u201d).\nOn May 24, 2019, the Company executed the Second Amendment to the 2017 Amended Credit Facility (the Second Revolver Amendment\u201d). As a result of the Second Revolver Amendment, the Credit Facility has a total borrowing capacity of $200.0 million with the ability to increase that capacity up to $300.0 million during the term, subject to lender approval. The Credit Facility provides the lenders with a security interest in the equity of the Company subsidiaries that own the properties included in the borrowing base. The indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Facility accrues interest at a rate ranging from the 30-day LIBOR plus 135 basis points to the 30-day LIBOR plus 195 basis points based on the total balance outstanding under the Credit Facility as a percentage of the total asset value of the Company, as defined in the 2017 Amended Credit Facility, as amended by the Second Revolver Amendment. The Credit Facility also accrues a fee of 15 to 25 basis points for any unused portion of the borrowing capacity based on whether the unused portion is greater or less than 50% of the total borrowing capacity. Pursuant to the Second Revolver Amendment, the Credit Facility matures on May 24, 2023, with the ability to extend the term for 1 year.\nOn November 26, 2019, the Company entered into the Third Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Third Revolver Amendment\u201d), which further amends the 2017 Amended Credit Facility. The Third Revolver Amendment included, among other things, an adjustment of certain financial maintenance covenants, including a temporary reduction of the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio to allow the Company to redeploy the proceeds received from the PINE Income Property Sale Transactions, and an increase in the maximum amount the Company may invest in stock and stock equivalents of real estate investment trusts to allow the Company to invest in the common stock and operating partnership units of PINE.\nAt December 31, 2019, the current commitment level under the Credit Facility was $200.0 million. The available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility was approximately $40.2 million, based on the level of borrowing base assets. As of December 31, 2019, the Credit Facility had a $159.8 million balance outstanding.\nThe Credit Facility is subject to customary restrictive covenants including, but not limited to, limitations on the Company's ability to: (a) incur indebtedness; (b) make certain investments; (c) incur certain liens; (d) engage in certain affiliate transactions; and (e) engage in certain major transactions such as mergers. In addition, the Company is subject to various financial maintenance covenants including, but not limited to, a maximum indebtedness ratio, a maximum secured indebtedness ratio, and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. The Credit Facility also contains affirmative covenants\n\t\t\nand events of default including, but not limited to, a cross default to the Company's other indebtedness and upon the occurrence of a change in control. The Company's failure to comply with these covenants or the occurrence of an event of default could result in acceleration of the Company's debt and other financial obligations under the Credit Facility.\nMortgage Notes Payable. In addition to the Credit Facility, the Company has certain other borrowings, as noted in the table above, all of which are non-recourse.\nConvertible Debt. The Company's $75.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.50% Convertible Notes (the 2020 Notes\u201d) were scheduled to mature on March 15, 2020. Based on multiple increases in the Company's quarterly dividends since the 2020 Notes were issued in March 2015, the conversion rate was equal to 14.6813 shares of common stock for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which represented an adjusted conversion price of approximately $68.11 per share of common stock.\nOn February 3, 2020, the Company closed privately negotiated exchange agreements with certain holders of its outstanding 2020 Notes pursuant to which the Company issued $57.4 million principal amount of 3.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the 2025 Notes\u201d) in exchange for $57.4 million principal amount of the 2020 Notes (collectively the Private Exchanges\u201d). In addition, the Company closed a privately negotiated purchase agreement with an investor and issued approximately $17.6 million principal amount of the 2025 Notes (the Private Placement,\u201d and together with the Private Exchanges, the Transactions\u201d). The Company used approximately $5.9 million of the proceeds from the Private Placement to repurchase approximately $5.9 million of the 2020 Notes. As a result of the Transactions there is a total of $75 million of outstanding 2025 Notes.\nIn exchange for issuing the 2025 Notes pursuant to the Private Exchanges, the Company received and cancelled the exchanged 2020 Notes. The $11.7 million of net proceeds from the Private Placement will be used to redeem at maturity on March 15, 2020 approximately $11.7 million of the aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes that remain outstanding.\nThe 2025 Notes represent senior unsecured obligations of the Company and pay interest semi-annually in arrears on each April 15th and October 15th, commencing on April 15, 2020, at a rate of 3.875% per annum. The 2025 Notes mature on April 15, 2025 and may not be redeemed by the Company prior to the maturity date. The conversion rate for the 2025 Notes is initially 12.7910 shares of the Company's common stock per $1,000 of principal of the 2025 Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $78.18 per share of the Company's common stock). The initial conversion price of the 2025 Notes represents a premium of approximately 20% to the $65.15 closing sale price of the Company's common stock on the NYSE American on January 29, 2020. The 2025 Notes are convertible into cash, common stock or a combination thereof, subject to various conditions, at the Company's option. Should certain corporate transactions or events occur prior to the stated maturity date, the Company will increase the conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its 2025 Notes in connection with such corporate transaction or event.\nThe conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Holders may not surrender their 2025 Notes for conversion prior to December 15, 2024 except upon the occurrence of certain conditions relating to the closing sale price of the Company's common stock, the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2025 Notes, or specified corporate events including a change in control of the Company. The Company may not redeem the 2025 Notes prior to the stated maturity date and no sinking fund is provided for the 2025 Notes. The 2025 Notes are convertible, at the election of the Company, into solely cash, solely shares of the Company's common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of the Company's common stock. The Company intends to settle the 2025 Notes in cash upon conversion, with any excess conversion value to be settled in shares of our common stock. In accordance with GAAP, the 2025 Notes will be accounted for as a liability with a separate equity component recorded for the conversion option. A liability will be recorded for the 2025 Notes on the issuance date at fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis using current market rates for debt instruments with similar terms. The difference between the initial proceeds from the 2025 Notes and the estimated fair value of the debt instruments will result in a debt discount, with an offset recorded to additional paid-in capital representing the equity component.\n\t\t\nAcquisitions and Investments. As noted previously, the Company acquired ten single-tenant income properties and one multi-tenant income property, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $164.7 million. These acquisitions included the following:\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTenant Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTenant Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nProperty Location\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDate of Acquisition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nProperty Square-Feet\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nProperty Acres\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPurchase Price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercentage Leased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRemaining Lease Term at Acquisition Date (in years)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nHobby Lobby Stores, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSingle-Tenant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWinston-Salem, NC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n05/16/19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n55,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n8,075,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n24 Hour Fitness USA, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSingle-Tenant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFalls Church, VA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n05/23/19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n46,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n21,250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWalgreen Co.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSingle-Tenant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBirmingham, AL\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n06/05/19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9.8\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFamily Dollar Stores of Massachusetts, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSingle-Tenant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLynn, MA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n06/07/19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.8\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWalgreen Co.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSingle-Tenant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAlbany, GA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n06/21/19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,634,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCarpenter Hotel (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSingle-Tenant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAustin, TX\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n07/05/19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nN/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n16,250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n99.1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeneral Dynamics Corporation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSingle-Tenant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nReston, VA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n07/12/19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n64,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18,600,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9.9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLive Nation Entertainment, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSingle-Tenant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEast Troy, WI\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n08/30/19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nN/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n158.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nParty City Corporation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSingle-Tenant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOceanside, NY\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n09/24/19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,120,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBurlington Stores, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSingle-Tenant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nN.

The $1.5 million purchase price contribution is reflected as deferred revenue and will be accreted into income property rental revenue over the term of the lease.\nWe are targeting investments between approximately $160.0 million to $210.0 million in income-producing properties during 2019. We expect to fund our acquisitions utilizing available capacity under our credit facility, cash from operations, proceeds from the dispositions of income properties, and potentially the sale of all or a portion of our Subsurface Interests. We expect dispositions of income properties and subsurface interests will qualify under the like-kind exchange deferred-tax structure, and additional financing sources.\nDispositions. In addition to the 20 single-tenant net lease properties sold to PINE in November 2019, the Company completed the sale of four other income properties during the year ended December 31, 2019. In February 2019, the Company sold its approximately 59,000 square foot multi-tenant retail property located in Sarasota, Florida that was anchored by a Whole Foods Market grocery store, for approximately $24.6 million. In May 2019, the Company sold its approximately 112,000 square foot retail strip center, anchored by a 24-Hour Fitness, for approximately $18.3 million. In June 2019 the Company sold its approximately 76,000 square foot two-tenant office property in Santa Clara, California for approximately $37 million. And finally, in August of 2019, the Company sold its property that was subject to a ground lease with WaWa for approximately $2.8 million. In aggregate, the four dispositions generated approximately $82.6 million in proceeds with gains recognized of approximately $20.8 million, or approximately $3.06 per share, after tax.\nContractual Commitments. In connection with the acquisition of The Strand property located in Jacksonville, FL on December 9, 2019, the Company received a credit of approximately $450,000 for a tenant improvement allowance for one of the tenants of The Strand. Accordingly, this amount is included in Accrued and Other Liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2019. Subsequent to December 31, 2019, the improvements were completed by the tenant and the Company funded the $450,000.\nIn connection with the Daytona Beach Development, the Company has executed agreements for the demolition of certain existing structures, which commitments totaled approximately $316,000 as of December 31, 2019.\nOther Matters. In connection with a certain land sale contract to which the Company is a party, the purchaser's pursuit of customary development entitlements gave rise to an inquiry by federal regulatory agencies regarding prior agricultural activities by the Company on such land. During the second quarter of 2015, we received a written information request regarding such activities. We submitted a written response to the information request along with supporting documentation. During the fourth quarter of 2015, based on discussions with the agency, a penalty related to this matter was deemed probable, and accordingly the estimated penalty of $187,500 was accrued as of December 31, 2015, for which payment was made during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. Also, during the fourth quarter of 2015, the agency advised the Company that the resolution to the inquiry would likely require the Company to incur costs associated with wetlands restoration relating to approximately 148.4 acres of the Company's land. At December 31, 2015, the Company's third-party environmental engineers estimated the cost for such restoration activities to range from approximately $1.7 million to approximately $1.9 million. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2015, the Company accrued an obligation of approximately $1.7 million, representing the low end of the estimated range of possible restoration costs, and included such estimated costs on the consolidated balance sheets as an increase in the basis of our land and development costs\n\t\t\nassociated with those and benefitting surrounding acres. As of June 30, 2016, the final proposal from the Company's third-party environmental engineer was received reflecting a total cost of approximately $2.0 million. Accordingly, an increase in the accrual of approximately $300,000 was made during the second quarter of 2016. During the first quarter of 2019, the Company received a revised estimate for completion of the restoration work for which the adjusted final total cost was approximately $2.4 million. Accordingly, an increase in the accrual of approximately $361,000 was recorded during the first quarter of 2019. The Company has funded approximately $2.3 million of the total $2.4 million of estimated costs through December 31, 2019, leaving a remaining accrual of approximately $121,000. The Company believes there is at least a reasonable possibility that the estimated remaining liability of approximately $121,000 could change within one year of the date of the consolidated financial statements, which in turn could have a material impact on the Company's consolidated balance sheets and future cash flows. The Company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis; however, actual results may differ from those estimates.\nDuring the first quarter of 2017, the Company completed the sale of approximately 1,581 acres of land to Minto Communities LLC which acreage represents a portion of the Company's remaining $430,000 obligation. Accordingly, the Company deposited $423,000 of cash in escrow to secure performance on the obligation. The funds in escrow can be drawn upon completion of certain milestones including completion of restoration and annual required monitoring. The first such milestone was achieved during the fourth quarter of 2017 and $189,500 of the escrow was refunded. The second milestone related to the completion of the first-year maintenance and monitoring was achieved during the first quarter of 2019 and $77,833 of the escrow was refunded leaving an escrow balance of approximately $156,000 as of December 31, 2019. Additionally, resolution of the regulatory matter required the Company to apply for an additional permit pertaining to an additional approximately 54.66 acres, which permit may require mitigation activities which the Company anticipates could be satisfied through the utilization of existing mitigation credits owned by the Company or the acquisition of mitigation credits. Resolution of this matter allowed the Company to obtain certain permits from the applicable federal or state regulatory agencies needed in connection with the closing of the land sale contract that gave rise to this matter. As of June 30, 2017, the Company determined that approximately 36 mitigation credits were required to be utilized, which represents approximately $298,000 in cost basis of the Company's mitigation credits. Accordingly, the Company transferred the mitigation credits through a charge to direct cost of revenues of real estate operations during the three months ended June 30, 2017, thereby resolving the required mitigation activities related to the approximately 54.66 acres. In addition, in connection with other land sale contracts to which the Company is or may become a party, the pursuit of customary development entitlements by the potential purchasers may require the Company to utilize or acquire mitigation credits for the purpose of obtaining certain permits from the applicable federal or state regulatory agencies. Any costs incurred in connection with utilizing or acquiring such credits would be incorporated into the basis of the land under contract. No amounts related to such potential future costs have been accrued as of December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we have no other contractual requirements to make capital expenditures.\nWe believe we will have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations, capital requirements, maintenance, and debt service requirements over the next twelve months and into the foreseeable future, with cash on hand, cash flow from our operations and approximately $40.1 million of available capacity on the existing $200.0 million Credit Facility, based on our current borrowing base of income properties, as of December 31, 2019.\nIn early 2017, the Company established a new $10 million stock repurchase program (the $10 Million Repurchase Program\u201d), in addition to the remaining approved repurchases under a prior plan totaling approximately $2.6 million. The Company completed repurchases totaling approximately $7.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. On July 18, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors approved an increase of approximately $7.1 million to the stock repurchase program, refreshing the total program to an aggregate of $10 million (the 2018 Increase\u201d), as the Company had completed repurchases prior the 2018 Increase. Including repurchases under the 2018 Increase, the Company repurchased a total of 168,602 shares of its common stock on the open market for a total cost of approximately $9.8 million, or an average price per share of $58.35, during the year ended December 31, 2018. In January 2019, the Company's Board of Directors approved an increase of $10.0 million to the stock repurchase program, refreshing the total program to an aggregate of $10 million. As of the quarter ended September 30, 2019 the Company had repurchased 211,736 shares for approximately $12.7 million. In April 2019 the Company's Board approved the repurchase of a block of shares from the Company's largest shareholder whereby the Company repurchased 320,741 shares for approximately $18.4 million, or $57.50 per share. In November 2019 the Company's Board approved a new $10 million buyback program. During the fourth quarter of 2019 the Company repurchased 158,625 shares for approximately $10 million, or $63.04 per share. The shares of the Company's common stock repurchased during each of the aforementioned years through the year ended December 31, 2019 were returned to the Company's treasury.\n\t\t\nOur Board of Directors and management consistently review the allocation of capital with the goal of providing the best long-term return for our shareholders. These reviews consider various alternatives, including increasing or decreasing regular dividends, repurchasing the Company's securities, and retaining funds for reinvestment. Annually, the Board reviews our business plan and corporate strategies, and makes adjustments as circumstances warrant. Management's focus is to continue our strategy to diversify our portfolio by redeploying proceeds from like-kind exchange transactions and utilizing our Credit Facility to increase our portfolio of income-producing properties, providing stabilized cash flows with strong risk-adjusted returns primarily in larger metropolitan areas and growth markets.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS\nWe have various contractual obligations, which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as certain development obligations, are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements, but are required to be disclosed.\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments on an undiscounted basis at December 31, 2019, and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. In addition, the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings.\nPAYMENT DUE BY PERIOD\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess\nThan 1\nYear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1-3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMore\nThan 5\nYears\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-Term Debt Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n288,729,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n75,000,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n23,884,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n159,845,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n30,000,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating Leases Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n400,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n126,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n241,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n32,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nConstruction and Other Commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n205,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n102,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n102,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n289,336,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n75,229,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n24,228,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n159,878,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n30,000,000\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe consolidated condensed financial statements included in this Annual Report are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. The development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management and the related disclosures have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nOur significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K; however, the most critical accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and, therefore, may result in actual amounts that differ from estimates, are as follows:\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nBecause of the variability in market conditions that have occurred in the national real estate markets, and the volatility and uncertainty in the financial and credit markets, it is possible that the estimates and assumptions, most notably those related to the Company's investment in income properties and commercial loans, could change materially during the time span associated with the continued volatility of the real estate and financial markets or as a result of a significant dislocation in those markets.\n\t\t\nPurchase Accounting for Acquisitions of Real Estate Subject to a Lease. In accordance with the FASB guidance on business combinations, the fair value of the real estate acquired with in-place leases is allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and tenant improvements, and identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases, the value of in-place leases, and the value of leasing costs, based in each case on their relative fair values.\nThe fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired leased property is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the as-if-vacant\u201d value is then allocated to land, building and tenant improvements based on the determination of the fair values of these assets.\nIn allocating the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property, above-market and below-market in-place lease values are recorded as other assets or liabilities based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases, and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease, including the probability of renewal periods. The capitalized above-market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. The capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the initial term unless the Company believes that it is likely that the tenant will renew the option whereby the Company amortizes the value attributable to the renewal over the renewal period.\nThe aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets, consisting of in-place leases, is measured by the excess of (i) the purchase price paid for a property after adjusting existing in-place leases to market rental rates over (ii) the estimated fair value of the property as-if-vacant, determined as set forth above. The value of in-place leases exclusive of the value of above-market and below-market in-place leases is amortized to expense over the remaining non-cancelable periods of the respective leases. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be written off. The value of tenant relationships is reviewed on individual transactions to determine if future value was derived from the acquisition.\nIncome Property Leases. The rental of the Company's income properties are classified as operating leases. The Company recognizes lease income on these properties on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\nLand and Development Costs. The carrying value of land and development includes the initial acquisition costs of land, improvements thereto, and other costs incidental to the acquisition or development of land. Subsurface Interests (hereinafter defined) and capitalized costs relating to timber and hay operations are also included in land and development costs. These costs are allocated to properties on a relative sales value basis and are charged to costs of sales as specific properties are sold. Due to the nature of the business, land and development costs have been classified as an operating activity on the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nSales of Real Estate. Gains and losses on sales of real estate are accounted for as required by FASB ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company recognizes revenue from the sales of real estate when the Company transfers the promised goods and/or services in the contract based on the transaction price allocated to the performance obligations within the contract. As market information becomes available, real estate cost basis is analyzed and recorded at the lower of cost or market.\nLong-Lived Assets. The Company follows FASB ASC Topic 360-10, Property, Plant, and Equipment in conducting its impairment analyses. The Company reviews the recoverability of long-lived assets, including land and development costs, real estate held for sale, and property, plant, and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Examples of situations considered to be triggering events include: a substantial decline in operating cash flows during the period, a current or projected loss from operations, an income property not fully leased or leased at rates that are less than current market rates, and any other quantitative or qualitative events deemed significant by our management. Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment by using an undiscounted cash flow approach, which considers future estimated capital expenditures. Impairment of long-lived assets is measured at fair value less cost to sell.\n\t\t\nStock-Based Compensation. Prior to 2010, the Company maintained a stock option plan (the 2001 Plan\u201d) pursuant to which 500,000 shares of the Company's common stock were available to be issued. The 2001 Plan was approved at the April 25, 2001 shareholders' meeting and expired in April 2011, with no new option shares issued after that date.\nAt the Annual Meeting of Shareholders of the Company held on April 28, 2010, the Company's shareholders approved the Consolidated-Tomoka Land Co. 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the Original 2010 Plan\u201d). The Original 2010 Plan replaced the Company's 2001 Plan. At the Annual Meeting of Shareholders of the Company held on April 24, 2013, the Company's shareholders approved an amendment and restatement of the entire Original 2010 Plan, which among other things, incorporated claw back provisions and clarified language regarding the shares available subsequent to forfeiture of any awards of restricted shares. At the Annual Meeting of Shareholders of the Company held on April 23, 2014, the Company's shareholders approved an amendment to the Original 2010 Plan increasing the number of shares authorized for issuance by 240,000 shares, bringing the total number of shares authorized for issuance to 450,000. At the Annual Meeting of Shareholders of the Company held on April 25, 2018, the Company's shareholders approved the Second Amended and Restated 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2010 Plan\u201d) which, among other things, increased the number of shares available thereunder to 720,000. Awards under the 2010 Plan may be in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted share units, performance shares, and performance units. Employees of the Company and its subsidiaries and non-employee directors may be selected by the Compensation Committee to receive awards under the 2010 Plan. The maximum number of shares of which stock awards may be granted under the 2010 Plan is 702,000 shares. No participant may receive awards during any one calendar year representing more than 50,000 shares of common stock. In no event will the number of shares of common stock issued under the plan upon the exercise of incentive stock options exceed 720,000 shares. These limits are subject to adjustments by the Compensation Committee as provided in the 2010 Plan for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations, and other similar transactions or events. The 2010 Plan currently provides that it will expire on the tenth anniversary of the date that it was adopted by the Board, and that no awards will be granted under the plan after that date.\nAll non-qualified stock option awards, restricted share awards, and performance share awards granted under the 2010 Plan were determined to be equity-based awards under FASB ASC Topic, Share-Based Payments.\nThe Company used the Black-Scholes valuation pricing model to determine the fair value of its non-qualified stock option awards. The determination of the fair value of the awards is affected by the stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of other variables. These variables include expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, annual dividends, and a risk-free interest rate assumption.\nThe Company used a Monte Carlo simulation pricing model to determine the fair value and vesting period of the restricted share awards. The determination of the fair value of market condition-based awards is affected by the stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of other variables. These variables include expected stock price volatility over the requisite performance term of awards, the performance of the Company's stock price, annual dividends, and a risk-free interest rate assumption. Compensation cost is recognized regardless of the achievement of the market conditions, provided the requisite service period is met.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW\nForward-Looking Statements\nWhen the Company uses any words such as anticipate,\u201d assume,\u201d believe,\u201d estimate,\u201d expect,\u201d intend,\u201d or similar expressions, the Company is making forward-looking statements. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon current expectations and reasonable assumptions, the Company's actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Certain factors or risks that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those the Company anticipates or projects are described in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Given these uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any document incorporated herein by reference. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRecent Developments Impacting our Business\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company completed the following transactions that were transformational to the Company and its operating results for the year ended December 31, 2019 and meaningful to its ongoing operations in the periods subsequent to December 31, 2019:\n \u00b7 Land JV Transaction \nOn October 16, 2019, the Company completed the sale of a controlling interest in its wholly-owned subsidiary, Crisp39 SPV LLC to affiliates of Magnetar Capital LLC (the Magnetar Land Sale\u201d); (i) Flacto, LLC ( Flacto\u201d); (ii) Magnetar Longhorn Fund LP ( Longhorn\u201d); and (iii) Magnetar Structured Credit Fund, LP ( Magnetar SCF\u201d and collectively with Flacto and Longhorn, the Magnetar Investors\u201d) pursuant to an Interest Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d), for $97 million. Crisp39 SPV LLC holds the approximately 5,300 acres of undeveloped land in Daytona Beach, Florida (the Land JV\u201d). Following the closing of the Purchase Agreement, the Magnetar Investors collectively own a notional 66.50% equity interest in the Land JV, and the Company owns a notional 33.50% equity interest in the Land JV (collectively, the Company and the Magnetar Investors are herein referred to as the JV Partners\u201d). The transaction resulted in a gain of approximately $78.6 million, or approximately $12.21 per share, after tax, on the sale of the 66.50% equity interest in the Land JV and a non-cash gain of approximately $48.9 million on the Company's retained interest in the Land JV, or approximately $7.59 per share, after tax.\nThe Company serves as the manager (the Manager\u201d) of the Land JV and is responsible for day-to-day operations at the direction of the JV Partners. All major decisions and certain other actions must be approved by the unanimous consent of the JV Partners (the Unanimous Actions\u201d). Unanimous Actions include the approval of pricing for all land parcels in the Land JV; approval of contracts for the sale of land that contain material revisions to the standard purchase contract of the Land JV; entry into any lease agreement affiliated with the Land JV; entering into listing or brokerage agreements; approval and amendment of the Land JV's operating budget; obtaining financing for the Land JV; admission of additional members; and dispositions of the Land JV's real property for amounts less than market value. Pursuant to the Limited Liability Agreement of the Land JV will pay the Manager a management fee in the initial amount of $20,000 per month, which amount will be evaluated on a quarterly basis and reduced based on the value of real property that remains in the Land JV.\nAs a result of the Magnetar Land Sale, the Company has effectively divested all of its land holdings and as such the impact of the occurrence of land sales, which had been a primary element of the Company's business for virtually its entire history, has been essentially eliminated. In addition, the need for utilizing the 1031 like-kind exchange structure to deploy proceeds from land sales into replacement assets, primarily income properties, has also been reduced substantially.\n\t\t\n \u00b7 Alpine Income Property Trust, Inc. (NYSE: PINE) \nOn November 26, 2019, as part of the initial public offering (the IPO\u201d) of Alpine Income Property Trust, Inc. ( PINE\u201d) on the New York Stock Exchange, the Company and certain of its affiliates entered into purchase and sale agreements with PINE and Alpine Income Property OP, LP (the PINE OP\u201d), pursuant to which the Company and such affiliates sold, and PINE or the PINE OP purchased, 15 properties for aggregate cash consideration of $125.9 million (collectively, the Purchase and Sale Transaction\u201d). In addition, the Company and certain of its affiliates entered into contribution agreements with the PINE OP, pursuant to which the Company and such affiliates contributed to the PINE OP five properties (the Contributed Properties\u201d) for an aggregate of 1,223,854 OP units of the PINE OP (the OP Units\u201d), which have an initial value of approximately $23.3 million (the Contribution Transaction\u201d), and collectively with the Purchase and Sale Transaction, (the PINE Income Property Sale Transactions\u201d). The PINE Income Property Sale Transactions resulted in a gain of approximately $1.0 million, or approximately $0.16 per share, after tax.\nConcurrently with the PINE Income Property Sale Transactions, the Company purchased 394,737 shares of PINE common stock for a total purchase price of $7.5 million (the Private Placement\u201d). Also, on November 26, 2019, the Company purchased 421,053 shares of PINE common stock in the IPO for a total purchase price of $8.0 million (the IPO Purchase\u201d and together with the Private Placement, the Equity Transactions\u201d). Including the Company's investment in PINE as a result of receiving 1,223,854 OP Units, the Company owns, in the aggregate, approximately 2.04 million shares of PINE common stock, or approximately 22.3% of PINE's total shares outstanding.\nIn addition to the PINE Income Property Sale Transactions, the PINE IPO was significant for the Company and our business because concurrent with the PINE IPO, the Company entered into a management agreement with PINE (the Management Agreement\u201d) pursuant to which the Company is responsible for managing, operating, and administering the day-to-day operations, business and affairs of PINE, subject to the direction and supervision of PINE's board of directors (the PINE Board\u201d) and in accordance with the investment guidelines approved and monitored by the PINE Board. Pursuant to the Management Agreement, PINE agreed to pay the Company a base management fee equal to 0.375% per quarter (or 1.5% annually) of PINE's total equity\u201d (as defined in the Management Agreement) calculated and payable in cash, quarterly in arrears. Based on the equity raised in PINE's IPO and the Private Placement, the initial base management fee would approximate $2.6 million. In addition, we have the ability to earn an incentive fee based on PINE's shareholders achieving an annual return that exceeds an 8% annual hurdle, subject to a high-water mark price. The amount of the incentive fee would equal 15% of the amount by which the PINE shareholders annual return exceeds 8% in any given year. The initial term of the Management Agreement is five (5) years and the Management Agreement cannot be terminated by either party during the initial term except for certain definitive events which pertain primarily to our default or lack of performance. We also entered into an exclusivity and right of first offer agreement (the Exclusivity and ROFO Agreement\u201d) with PINE at the date of its IPO. Pursuant to the Exclusivity and ROFO Agreement the Company agreed not to invest in single-tenant net lease income properties, with limited exceptions. Further, the Company agreed to provide PINE with a right of first offer should the Company decided to sell any of its remaining portfolio of single-tenant net leased income properties in the future.\n \u00b7 Golf Operations \nOn October 17, 2019, the Company sold its interest in the golf operations for $3.45 million (the Golf Sale\u201d), resulting in no gain on the transaction. The Company provided the buyer with financing in the form of an approximately $2.1 million first mortgage loan with a term of one year. As a result of the sale of the golf operations, the Company is no longer engaged in the ownership and operation of LPGA or any other golf club business.\n\t\t\nOur Business\nWe are a diversified real estate operating company that was founded in 1910. As of December 31, 2019, we own and manage, sometimes utilizing third-party property management companies, thirty-four commercial real estate properties in eleven states in the United States, with approximately 1.8 million square feet of gross leasable space. These thirty-four properties in our portfolio comprise our income property operations segment.\nIn addition to our income property portfolio, as of December 31, 2019, or business included the following:\nManagement Services:\n \u00b7 A fee-based management business that is engaged in managing PINE and the Land JV, see Note 5, Related Party Management Services Business\u201d. \nCommercial Loan Investments:\n \u00b7 A portfolio of commercial loan investments. \nReal Estate Operations:\n \u00b7 A portfolio of mineral interests consisting of approximately 455,000 subsurface acres in 20 counties in the state of Florida and a portfolio of mitigation credits; \n \u00b7 A retained interest in the Land JV which is seeking to sell approximately 5,300 acres of undeveloped land in Daytona Beach, Florida; and \n \u00b7 An interest in a joint venture (the Mitigation Bank JV\u201d) that owns an approximately 2,500 acre parcel of land in the western part of Daytona Beach, Florida which is engaged in the operation of a mitigation bank, which, pursuant to a mitigation plan approved by the applicable state and federal authorities, produces mitigation credits that are marketed and sold to developers of land in the Daytona Beach area for the purpose of enabling the developers to obtain certain regulatory permits. \nOur business also includes, as outlined above, our investment in PINE of approximately $38.8 million resulting from the Equity Transactions, or approximately 22.3% of the PINE's outstanding equity, including the OP Units which are exchangeable into common stock of PINE on a one-for-one basis, at PINE's election. Our investment in PINE should generate investment income through the dividends distributed by PINE. In addition to the dividends we receive from PINE, our investment in PINE may benefit from any appreciation in PINE's stock price, although no assurances can be provided that such appreciation will occur, the amount by which our investment will increase in value, or the timing thereof. Any dividends received from PINE are included in Investment Income on the accompanying statement of operations.\nPrior to 2019, the Company operated in four primary business segments: income properties, commercial loan investments, real estate operations, and golf operations. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company commenced efforts to monetize the golf operations and accordingly, as of December 31, 2018, the golf assets and liabilities related to the golf operations were classified as held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the results of golf operations were classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for all years presented. The golf operations segment, although discontinued in 2018, held assets as of December 31, 2018. Accordingly, the identifiable assets and liabilities have been disclosed separately as discontinued golf operations for the years presented.\nAs a result of the significant transactions during the fourth quarter of 2019, including the Land JV transaction, the PINE Income Property Sale Transactions, and the Golf Sale, the Company's segment structure has been modified to more closely align with the continuing operations of the Company. The Company now operates in four primary business segments: income properties, management services, commercial loan investments, and real estate operations. The new management services segment consists of the revenue generated from managing PINE and the Land JV. The management services segment had no assets as of December 31, 2019, 2018, or 2017. The real estate operations segment previously included land sales from the Daytona Beach land portfolio as well as revenue and expenses related to the sale of mitigation credits and subsurface operations. Upon the completion of the Land JV transaction in the fourth quarter of 2019, the real estate operations related to land sales have been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 and the continuing real estate operations segment remaining consists of subsurface operations and mitigation credit sales. The identifiable assets and liabilities related to the discontinued real estate operations have been separately disclosed as discontinued real estate operations for the years presented.\n\t\t\nThe following is a summary of financial information regarding the Company's business segments (amounts in thousands) for the years ended December 31:\n\n (1) Corporate and Other assets includes all other corporate assets, including cash, restricted cash, and investment securities. \nBUSINESS PLAN\nOur business plan going forward is primarily focused on investing in income-producing real estate, primarily multi-tenant commercial retail properties occupied by retail or office tenants. We may also self-develop multi-tenant income properties, as we have done in the past. We may also invest in commercial loans or similar financings secured by commercial real estate. Our investment in multi-tenant income properties, and possibly single-tenant net lease assets that fall outside our Exclusivity and ROFO agreement with PINE, may utilize proceeds from the sale of an income property currently in our portfolio and because our tax basis in property likely carries a tax basis from the low-basis land parcel we sold to by the existing property, we may seek to have the sale of the existing income property qualify for income tax deferral through the like-kind exchange provisions under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code. The low tax basis in our income property portfolio is the result of us having acquired the original land primarily in the early part of our 100 plus year history. Utilizing the like-kind exchange structure allows us to continue to defer the related income taxes on the original gains from the land sales and possibly the gains achieved on the sale of the original replacement property or properties. Generally, in order to utilize the like-kind exchange structure, we are prohibited from engaging in activities that are typically indicative of the developer of an income property or a dealer in income property sales. Our approach in investing in income-producing real estate is to use leverage, when appropriate or necessary, to fund our acquisitions and to help achieve our business objectives. Our use of leverage in acquiring income-producing real estate is intended to provide positive returns relative to our borrowing costs. We believe this enhances our Company's income-generating real estate asset base while keeping us cash flow positive.\nOur investment strategy seeks to acquire income properties, primarily multi-tenants, which will continue to broaden the credit base of our lease tenants, diversify our income property portfolio geographically, with an emphasis on major markets and growth markets in the U.S., and diversify the type of income-producing property. We may selectively choose to complete the development of an income property investment.\n\t\t\nProceeds from completed sales of income properties supply us with investible capital. Our access to sources of debt financing, particularly our borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility, also provide a source of capital for our investment strategy. Our strategy is to utilize leverage, when appropriate and necessary, and potentially proceeds from sales of income properties, the disposition or payoffs of our commercial loan investments, and certain transactions involving our Subsurface Interests, to acquire income properties. We may also acquire or originate commercial loan investments, invest in securities of real estate companies, or make other shorter-term investments. Our targeted investment classes may include the following:\n \u00b7 Multi-tenant office and retail properties in major metropolitan areas and growth markets, typically stabilized; \n \u00b7 Single-tenant retail and office, double or triple net leased, properties in major metropolitan areas and growth markets that are compliant with our commitments under the Exclusivity and ROFO agreement; \n \u00b7 Purchase or origination of ground leases, that are compliant with our commitments under the Exclusivity and ROFO agreement; \n \u00b7 Self-developed properties comprised of select office, flex, industrial, and retail; \n \u00b7 Joint venture development using land owned by the Land JV; \n \u00b7 Origination or purchase of commercial loan investments with loan terms of 1-10 years with strong risk-adjusted yields secured by property types to include hotel, office, retail, residential, land and industrial; \n \u00b7 Select regional area investments using Company market knowledge and expertise to earn strong risk-adjusted yields; and \n \u00b7 Real estate-related investment securities, including commercial mortgage-backed securities, preferred or common stock, and corporate bonds. \nOur investments in income-producing properties are typically subject to long-term leases. For multi-tenant properties, each tenant typically pays its proportionate share of the aforementioned operating expenses of the property, although for such properties we typically incur additional costs for property management services. Single-tenant leases are typically in the form of triple or double net leases and ground leases. Triple-net leases generally require the tenant to pay property operating expenses such as real estate taxes, insurance, assessments and other governmental fees, utilities, repairs and maintenance, and capital expenditures.\nINCOME PROPERTIES\nWe have pursued a strategy of investing in income-producing properties, when possible, by utilizing the proceeds from real estate transactions, including the disposition of income properties and transactions involving our Subsurface Interests.\nOur strategy for investing in income-producing properties is focused on factors including, but not limited to, long-term real estate fundamentals and target markets, including major markets or those markets experiencing significant economic growth. We employ a methodology for evaluating targeted investments in income-producing properties which includes an evaluation of: (i) the attributes of the real estate (e.g. location, market demographics, comparable properties in the market, etc.); (ii) an evaluation of the existing tenant(s) (e.g. credit-worthiness, property level sales, tenant rent levels compared to the market, etc.); (iii) other market-specific conditions (e.g. tenant industry, job and population growth in the market, local economy, etc.); and (iv) considerations relating to the Company's business and strategy (e.g. strategic fit of the asset type, property management needs, alignment with the Company's 1031 like-kind exchange structure, etc.).\nWe believe investment in each of these income-producing asset classes provides attractive opportunities for stable current cash flows and increased returns in the long run and the potential for capital appreciation.\n\t\t\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company acquired ten single-tenant income properties and one multi-tenant income property, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $164.7 million as described below:\n\n(1)The ground lease with The Carpenter Hotel includes two tenant repurchase options. Pursuant to FASB ASC Topic 842, Leases, the $16.25 million investment has been recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 as a commercial loan investment. See Note 4, Commercial Loan Investments\u201d.\nIn addition to the 20 single-tenant net lease properties sold to PINE in November 2019, the Company completed the sale of four other income properties during the year ended December 31, 2019. In February 2019, the Company sold its approximately 59,000 square foot multi-tenant retail property located in Sarasota, Florida that was anchored by a Whole Foods Market grocery store, for approximately $24.6 million. In May 2019, the Company sold its approximately 112,000 square foot retail strip center, anchored by a 24-Hour Fitness, for approximately $18.3 million. In June 2019, the Company sold its approximately 76,000 square foot multi-tenant office property in Santa Clara, California for approximately $37 million. And finally, in August of 2019, the Company sold its property that was subject to a ground lease with WaWa for approximately $2.8 million. In aggregate, the four dispositions generated approximately $82.6 million in proceeds with gains recognized of approximately $20.8 million, or approximately $3.06 per share, after tax.\nOur current portfolio of twenty-nine (29) single-tenant income properties generates approximately $20.4 million of revenues from straight-line base lease payments on an annualized basis and had a weighted average remaining lease term of 9.1 years as of December 31, 2019. Our current portfolio of five (5) multi-tenant properties generates approximately $8.9 million of revenue from straight-line base lease payments on an annualized basis and had a weighted average remaining lease term of 6.5 years as of December 31, 2019.\nAs part of our overall strategy for investing in income-producing properties, we have self-developed properties, including five multi-tenant office properties, all of which are located in Daytona Beach, Florida. We sold one these properties in 2016 and the four other properties on March 26, 2018.\nWe also self-developed two single-tenant net lease restaurant properties on a 6-acre beachfront parcel in Daytona Beach, Florida. The development was completed in January of 2018 and rent commenced from both tenants pursuant to their separate leases. On a limited basis, we have acquired and may continue to selectively acquire other real estate, either vacant land or land with existing structures, that we would demolish and develop into additional income properties, possibly in the downtown and beachside areas of Daytona Beach, Florida. Through December 31, 2019, we invested approximately $5.2 million to acquire approximately 6.0 acres in downtown Daytona Beach that is located in an opportunity zone. Specifically, our investments in the Daytona Beach area would target opportunistic acquisitions of select catalyst sites, which are typically distressed, with an objective of having short investment horizons. Should we pursue such acquisitions, we may seek to partner with developers to develop these sites rather than self-develop the properties.\nOur focus on acquiring income-producing investments includes a continual review of our existing income property portfolio to identify opportunities to recycle our capital through the sale of income properties based on, among other possible factors, the current or expected performance of the property and favorable market conditions. In the recent past, the Company was pursuing an effort to the monetize certain of our multi-tenant income properties with the Company intending to reinvest the potential proceeds from these dispositions into single-tenant net lease income properties. As a result of that strategy, we sold three multi-tenant income properties during the year ended December 31, 2019. In part, as a result of entering into the Exclusivity and ROFO Agreement, our income property investment strategy will be focused primarily on multi-tenant retail and office properties. We may pursue this strategy, in part, by monetizing certain of our\n\t\t\nsingle-tenant properties, and should we do so, we would seek to utilize the 1031 like-kind exchange structure to preserve the tax-deferred gain on the original transaction(s) that pertains to the replacement asset.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company owned twenty-nine single-tenant and five multi-tenant income properties in eleven states. Following is a summary of these properties:\n\nThe weighted average economical and physical occupancy rates of our income properties for each of the last three years on a portfolio basis are as follows:\n\n\t\t\nThe information on lease expirations of our total income property portfolio for each of the ten years starting with 2020 is as follows:\n\n (1) Annual Rents consist of the base rent to be received pursuant to each lease agreement, i.e. not on a straight-line basis. \nThe majority of leases have additional option periods beyond the original term of the lease, which typically are exercisable at the tenant's option.\nWe had one tenant that accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated income property revenue during the year ended December 31, 2019. Wells Fargo, who occupied two single-tenant office properties located in Hillsboro, Oregon and Raleigh, North Carolina, accounted for approximately 12.5% of our consolidated revenues during the year ended December 31, 2019. The office property leased to Wells Fargo located in Hillsboro, Oregon was sold as a part of the PINE Income Property Sale Transactions on November 26, 2019. The office property leased to Wells Fargo located in Raleigh, North Carolina also represented 26% of the total square footage of our income property portfolio as of December 31, 2019. A default by this tenant would have a material adverse effect on the Company's income properties segment and its overall results of operations. We have one other tenant, Fidelity Investments, who represented over 5% of our consolidated revenues during the year ended December 31, 2019, and a large percentage of the square footage of our income property portfolio, but not in excess of 10%.\nMANAGEMENT SERVICES BUSINESS\nOur business plans also include generating revenue from managing PINE and the Land JV. Pursuant to the Management Agreement, we will generate a base management fee equal to 1.5% of PINE's total equity. The structure of the base fee provides us with an opportunity for our base fee to grow should PINE's independent board members determine to raise additional equity capital in the future. We also have an opportunity to achieve additional cash flows as Manager of PINE pursuant to the terms of the incentive fee.\nThe Company also generates management fees as the Land JV Manager. Pursuant to the terms of the operating agreement for the Land JV, the initial amount of the management fee is $20,000 per month. The management fee is evaluated quarterly and as land sales occur in the Land JV, the basis for our management fee will be reduced as the management fee is based on the value of real property that remains in the Land JV.\nCOMMERCIAL LOAN INVESTMENTS\nOur investments in commercial loans or similar structured finance investments, such as mezzanine loans or other subordinated debt, have been and are expected to continue to be secured by commercial or residential real estate or the borrower's pledge of its ownership interest in the entity that owns the real estate. The first mortgage loans we invest in or originate are generally for commercial real estate located in the United States and its territories and are current or performing with either a fixed or floating rate. Some of these loans may be syndicated in either a pari-passu or senior/subordinated structure. Commercial first mortgage loans generally provide for a higher recovery rate due to their senior position in the underlying collateral. Commercial mezzanine loans are typically secured by a pledge of the borrower's equity ownership in the underlying commercial real estate. Unlike a mortgage, a mezzanine loan is not secured\n\t\t\nby a lien on the property. An investor's rights in a mezzanine loan are usually governed by an intercreditor agreement that provides holders with the rights to cure defaults and exercise control on certain decisions of any senior debt secured by the same commercial property.\n2019 Commercial Loan Investment Portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company invested approximately $18.3 million on three commercial loans, two were mortgage notes of $8 million and $8.25 million secured by a parcel of land in Orlando, Florida and a full-service hotel in Austin, Texas, respectively. In addition, in connection with the sale of the Company's golf operations, the Company provided an approximately $2.1 million loan to the buyer, with a maturity of one year and an interest rate of 7.5%. As of December 31, 2019, the Company's commercial loan investment portfolio included the three loans with a total remaining principal balance of approximately $18.2 million, a weighted average interest rate of approximately 11.3% and a remaining duration to maturity of approximately 0.5 years.\n2018 Commercial Loan Investment Portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company had two loan investments totaling approximately $11.9 million, that were repaid in full at maturity. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had no commercial loan investments.\n2017 Commercial Loan Investment Portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company invested in a $3 million loan on a parcel of land in Daytona Beach that was being developed into a multi-family condominium property. As of December 31, 2017, the Company's commercial loan investment portfolio included two loans with a total remaining principal balance of approximately $11.9 million, a weighted average interest rate of 9.5% and a remaining duration to maturity of approximately 0.5 years. During the year a $10 million mezzanine loan investment secured by a hotel located at the Dallas/Fort Worth airport in Texas and a $5 million mezzanine loan investment secured by a hotel located in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, were paid off in full.\nLAND and INVESTMENT IN THE LAND JV\nLand JV. As noted above, the direct impact of the Magnetar Land Sale is that the Company divested itself of its land holdings, but for the 6-acre Daytona Beach development land described below, and as such the occurrence of land sales, which had been a primary element of the Company's business for virtually its entire 109-year history, has been essentially discontinued. Consequently, the operations associated with our land holdings were treated as discontinued operations and accordingly the revenues and expenses that had been presented within the Company's real estate operations segment in prior periods were reclassified in the statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 and all prior periods presented.\nHowever, the Company is continuing to pursue land sales on the approximately 5,300 acres that formerly comprised its land holdings in its role as Manager (of the Land JV) on behalf of the JV Partners. The Company's retained interest in the Land JV represents a notional 33.5% stake in the venture, the value of which may be realized in the form of distributions based on the timing and the amount of proceeds achieved when the land is ultimately sold by the Land JV. As of March 6, 2020, the Land JV has completed approximately $22 million in land sales since its inception in mid-October 2019 and currently has a pipeline of 10 purchase and sale agreements for potential land sale transactions representing approximately $97 million of potential proceeds to the Land JV. The 4,200 acres under contract represents approximately 84% of the total remaining land in the Land JV.\nDaytona Beach Development. We may selectively acquire other real estate in Daytona Beach, Florida. We may target either vacant land or land with existing structures that we would raze and develop into additional income properties. During 2018, the Company acquired a 5-acre parcel of land with existing structures in downtown Daytona Beach, for a purchase price of approximately $2.0 million. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has also acquired other contiguous parcels totaling approximately 1-acre for approximately $2.1 million. Combined, these parcels represent the substantial portion of an entire city block in downtown Daytona Beach adjacent to International Speedway Boulevard, a major thoroughfare in Daytona Beach. The combined 6 acres is located in an opportunity zone and a community redevelopment area. In addition, this property is proximate to the future headquarters of Brown & Brown Inc., the sixth largest insurance broker in the U.S. and a publicly listed company that is expected to be occupied by at least 600 of their employees. We have engaged a national real estate brokerage firm to assist us in identifying a developer or investor to acquire a portion or all of the property or to contribute into a potential joint venture to redevelop the property. We are pursuing entitlements for the potential redevelopment of these parcels, along with certain other adjacent land parcels, some of which we have under contract for purchase. As of December 31, 2019, we have incurred approximately $1.1 million in raze and entitlement costs related to these parcels. Our intent for investments in the Daytona Beach area is to target opportunistic acquisitions\n\t\t\nof select catalyst sites, which are typically distressed, with the objective of short-to-medium investment horizons. We may enter into joint ventures or other partnerships to develop land we have acquired or may acquire in the future in lieu of self-developing.\nRevenue from Tomoka Town Center. During 2015 and 2016, the Company completed three land sales with a gross sales price totaling approximately $21.4 million, with Tanger Outlets ( Tanger\u201d), Sam's Club ( Sams\u201d), and North American Development Group ( NADG\u201d), representing the sale of approximately 235 acres of land that is now the location of a Tanger Outlet mall, a Sam's Club retail property and a retail power center called the Tomoka Town Center. As part of the three land sale agreements and subsequent land sales with NADG, the Company performed certain infrastructure work, which began in the fourth quarter of 2015 and was completed in the fourth quarter of 2016, for which the Company would be reimbursed for the cost of the infrastructure work. The Company received NADG's portion of the reimbursement as NADG closed on each parcel of land included in the respective land sales contracts with the Company. Tanger and Sam's agreed to pay their reimbursement of the infrastructure costs over a ten-year period. The reimbursements applicable to and due from Tanger and Sam's totaled approximately $2.8 million. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has received approximately $1.1 million of the Tanger and Sam's reimbursements. These reimbursements are included in the results of the land operations which are now reflected in discontinued operations and will be through the final payment of Tanger's and Sam's reimbursement obligation.\nSince the transition in our land operations occurred late in 2019, the impact of land sales for the periods prior to October 2019 are no longer germane to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As such the following summarized information is provided regarding land sales activity prior to October 2019.\n2019 Land Sales. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company completed five (5) land sales transactions, including: (i) the Magnetar Land Sale for approximately 5,300 acres of land, for total proceeds of approximately $97 million; (ii) two transactions with Unicorp Development representing approximately 23.6 acres and generating aggregate proceeds of approximately $7.1 million; (iii) the sale of approximately 38 acres for total proceeds of $710,000, and (iv) a land sale to NADG for approximately 13 acres generating proceeds of approximately $3 million. In total the Company, in 2019, sold approximately 5,400 acres generating proceeds of approximately $108 million. Including the approximately $48.9 million recognized on the retained interest in the Land JV, gains of approximately $133 million, or approximately $20.60 per share after tax, were recognized.\n2018 Land Sales. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company completed land transactions representing approximately 2,697 acres including: (i) the sale of a 70% interest in the Mitigation Bank (hereinafter defined) that holds approximately 2,492 acres for proceeds of $15.3 million and (ii) twelve land sales totaling approximately 205 acres for aggregate proceeds of approximately $43.7 million. The twelve land sales generated gains of approximately $32.6 million, or approximately $4.44 per share, after tax.\n2017 Land Sales. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company completed land transactions representing approximately 1,700 acres including: (i) the sale of nearly 1,600 acres to Minto Communities generating proceeds of approximately $27.2 million; (ii) two transactions with NADG of approximately 46 acres for total proceeds of approximately $10.6 million, and (iii) five other transactions representing approximately 73.5 acres that generated approximately $9.2 million of proceeds. The land sales in 2017 generated aggregate proceeds of approximately $45.5 million and gains of approximately $31.8 million, or approximately $3.51 per share, after tax.\nLand Impairments. As more fully described in Note 11, \"Impairment of Long-Lived Assets,\" during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company did not recognize any impairments on its undeveloped land holdings.\nMitigation Bank. The mitigation bank transaction consists of the sale of a 70% interest in the entity that holds approximately 2,492 acres of land that has been permitted for the creation of a wetland mitigation bank (the Mitigation Bank JV\u201d). The purchaser of the 70% interest in the Mitigation Bank JV is comprised of certain funds and accounts managed by an investment advisor subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. ( BlackRock\u201d). The Company retained an approximately 30% non-controlling interest in the Mitigation Bank JV. A third-party was retained by the Mitigation Bank JV as the day-to-day manager of the Mitigation Bank property, responsible for the maintenance, generation, tracking, and other aspects of wetland mitigation credits.\n\t\t\nThe Mitigation Bank JV intends to engage in the creation and sale of both federal and state wetland mitigation credits. These credits will be created pursuant to the applicable permits that have been or will be issued to the Mitigation Bank JV from the federal and state regulatory agencies that exercise jurisdiction over the awarding of such credits, but no assurances can be given as to the ultimate issuance, marketability or value of the credits. The Mitigation Bank JV received the permit from the state regulatory agency on June 8, 2018 (the State Permit\u201d). The state regulatory agency may award up to 355 state credits under the State Permit. On August 6, 2018, the state regulatory agency awarded the initial 88.84 credits under the State Permit. Receipt of the remaining federal permit is anticipated to occur prior to the end of 2020.\nThe gain on the sale of the 70% interest in the Mitigation Bank totaled approximately $18.4 million and is comprised of the gain on the sale of 70% interest for proceeds of $15.3 million as well as the gain on the retained 30% interest pursuant to FASB ASC Topic 610-20, Other Income - Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets. The gain is included in the Gain on Disposition of Assets in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2018, the approximately $6.8 million Investments in Joint Ventures included on the Company's consolidated balance sheets is comprised of the fair market value of the 30% retained interest in the Mitigation Bank JV.\nThe operating agreement of the Mitigation Bank JV (the Operating Agreement\u201d) executed in conjunction with the mitigation bank transaction stipulates that the Company shall arrange for sales of the Mitigation Bank JV's mitigation credits to unrelated third parties totaling no less than $6 million of revenue to the Mitigation Bank JV, net of commissions, by the end of 2020, utilizing a maximum of 60 mitigation credits (the Minimum Sales Requirement\u201d). The Operating Agreement stipulates that if the Minimum Sales Requirement is not achieved, then BlackRock has the right, but is not required, to cause the Company to purchase the number of mitigation credits necessary to reach the Minimum Sales Requirement (the Minimum Sales Guarantee\u201d). The Company estimates the fair value of the Minimum Sales Guarantee to be approximately $100,000 which was recorded as a reduction in the gain on the transaction and is included in Accrued and Other Liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018.\nAdditionally, the Operating Agreement provides BlackRock the right to cause the Company to purchase a maximum of 8.536 mitigation credits per quarter (the Commitment Amount\u201d) from the Mitigation Bank JV at a price equal to 60% of the then fair market value for mitigation credits (the Put Right\u201d). The Put Right is applicable even if the Mitigation Bank JV has not yet been awarded a sufficient number of mitigation credits by the applicable federal and state regulatory agencies. Further, in any quarter that BlackRock does not exercise its Put Right, the unexercised Commitment Amount for the applicable quarter may be rolled over to future calendar quarters. However, the Operating Agreement also stipulates that any amount of third-party sales of mitigation credits will reduce the Put Rights outstanding on a one-for-one basis, if the sales price of the third-party sales equals or exceeds the prices stipulated by the Put Right. Further, any sales of mitigation credits to third parties at the requisite minimum prices in a quarter that exceeds the quarterly amount of the Put Right will reduce the Put Rights in future calendar quarters on a one-for-one basis. The maximum potential of future payments for the Company pursuant to the Put Right is approximately $27 million. The Company estimates the fair value of the Put Right to be approximately $200,000, which was recorded as a reduction in the gain on the transaction and is included in Accrued and Other Liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018. In December 2019, BlackRock exercised its Put Right and put 25 mitigation credits to the Company, which the Company purchased for approximately $1.9 million, or approximately $75,000 per credit. The credits acquired were included as an increase to Impact Fees and Mitigation Credits on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2019.\nOther Real Estate Assets. The Company owns mitigation credits with a cost basis of approximately $2.3 million as of December 31, 2019. The increase in mitigation credits includes the 25 credits acquired from the Mitigation Bank during December 2019 as described in Note 6, Land and Investments in the Land JV. There were no mitigation credit sales during the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company transferred mitigation credits with a basis of approximately $124,000 to the land acquired by Buc-ee's. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company sold mitigation credits for approximately $1.0 million, for a gain of approximately $882,000, or $0.12 per share, after tax. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company sold mitigation credits for approximately $1.6 million, for a gain of approximately $1.3 million, or $0.15 per share, after tax. Additionally, the Company recorded the transfer of mitigation credits with a cost basis of approximately $298,000 as a charge to direct cost of revenues of real estate operations during the year ended December 31, 2017, as more fully described in Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company received cash payments of approximately $338,000 and $519,000, respectively, for impact fees with a cost basis that was generally of equal value, with no such impact fee sales during the year ended December 31, 2019, as the balance of impact fees is only approximately $2,000. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2018, impact fees with a cost basis of approximately $72,000 were transferred to the beachfront restaurant leased to LandShark Bar & Grill.\n\t\t\nSubsurface Interests. As of December 31, 2019, the Company owns full or fractional subsurface oil, gas, and mineral interests underlying approximately 455,000 surface\u201d acres of land owned by others in 20 counties in Florida (the Subsurface Interests\u201d). The revenues generated by the portfolio of subsurface interests includes the sale of subsurface acres, the leasing of subsurface acres for mineral exploration activities, and payments made to the Company, typically by the owner of the surface acres, to compensate us for releasing our right to enter the surface acres to access our subsurface acres.\nPrior to September 2019, the Company leased certain of the Subsurface Interests to a mineral exploration organization for exploration. An eight-year oil exploration lease was executed in 2011 that covered a portion of our Subsurface Interests. On September 20, 2017, the Company amended the oil exploration lease to, among other things, extend the expiration of the original term for five additional years to the new expiration date of September 22, 2024. As a result, the lease was effectively comprised of thirteen one-year terms as the lessee had the option to terminate the lease at the end of each lease year. The lessee had previously exercised renewal options through the eighth year of the lease which ended on September 22, 2019. The Lessee elected not to renew the oil exploration lease beyond September 22, 2019. During the eight years the lease was active the annual lease payments were recognized as revenue ratably over the respective twelve-month lease period. During the lease term a number of the renewals included the payment of a drilling penalty by the Lessee. The non-refundable drilling penalty payments were recognized as revenue when earned, i.e. when the amount agreed upon was paid. Lease income generated by the annual lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the guaranteed lease term. For the years December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, lease income of approximately $598,000, approximately $807,000, and approximately $807,000 was recognized, respectively.\nLease payments on the respective acreages and drilling penalties received through lease year eight are as follows:\n\n (1) Generally, cash payment for the Lease Payment and Drilling Penalty is received on or before the first day of the lease year. The Drilling Penalty, which is due within thirty days from the end of the prior lease year, is recorded as revenue when earned, i.e. when the amount is agreed upon, while the Lease Payment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective lease term. The oil exploration lease has not been renewed beyond September 22, 2019 and has effectively terminated. \nThere were no sales of subsurface acres during the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company sold approximately 38,750 acres of subsurface interests in Osceola County, Florida for approximately $2.1 million (the \"Osceola Subsurface Sale\"). The gain from the Osceola Subsurface Sale totaled approximately $2.08 million, or $0.23 per share, after tax.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company completed a transaction releasing our surface entry rights on approximately 600 acres in exchange for approximately $185,000 in cash and fee title to approximately 40 additional acres in Hendry County, valued at approximately $320,000. Including the non-cash value received, the gain from the transaction totaled approximately $435,000, or $0.06 per share, after tax. Additional cash payments for the release of surface entry rights during 2018 totaled approximately $73,000. The revenue from the release of surface entry rights during the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled approximately $2.1 million.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, the Company also received oil royalties from operating oil wells on 800 acres under a separate lease with a separate operator resulting in revenues received from oil royalties of approximately $42,000, $72,000, and $86,000, respectively.\n\t\t\nThe Company is not prohibited from selling any or all of its Subsurface Interests. The Company may release surface entry rights or other rights upon request of a surface owner for a negotiated release fee typically based on a percentage of the surface value. Should the Company complete a transaction to sell all or a portion of its Subsurface Interests or complete a release transaction, the Company may utilize the like-kind exchange structure in acquiring one or more replacement investments including income-producing properties. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company completed a transaction releasing our surface entry rights on approximately 600 acres in exchange for approximately $185,000 in cash and fee title to approximately 40 additional acres in Hendry County, valued at approximately $320,000. Including the non-cash value received, the gain from the transaction totaled approximately $435,000, or $0.06 per share, after tax. Additional cash payments for the release of surface entry rights during 2018 totaled approximately $73,000. Cash payments for the release of surface entry rights totaled approximately $104,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019, while there were no releases of surface entry rights during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nGOLF OPERATIONS\nThe Golf Sale closed in October 2019. Prior to October 2019, the Company owned the LPGA International Golf Club (the Club\u201d), a semi-private golf club consisting of two 18-hole championship golf courses, a three-hole practice facility, a clubhouse facility with food and beverage operations, and a fitness facility. The Club was managed by a third party.\nPrior to January 2017, the Company leased from the City of Daytona Beach, FL (the City\u201d) a large portion of the land underlying the Club (the Golf Course Lease\u201d). On January 24, 2017, the Company acquired the approximately 690 acres of land and improvements covered by the Golf Course Lease, for approximately $1.5 million (the Golf Course Land Purchase\u201d). In conjunction with the Golf Course Land Purchase, the Golf Course Lease was terminated. Therefore, during the first quarter of 2017, the Company eliminated the remaining accrued liability of approximately $2.2 million, resulting in the recognition of approximately $0.40 per share in non-cash earnings, or $0.24 per share after tax, which comprises the Golf Course Lease termination in the consolidated statements of operations. The $2.2 million consisted of approximately $1.7 million which reflects the acceleration of the remaining amount of accrued rent that was no longer owed to the City as a result of the Lease Amendment, which prior to the Golf Course Land Purchase was being recognized into income over the remaining lease term which was originally to expire in 2022. The remaining approximately $500,000 reflects the amount of rent accrued pursuant to the Golf Course Lease, as amended, which will no longer be owed to the City due to the lease termination on January 24, 2017.\nAs a part of the Golf Course Land Purchase, the Company donated to the City three land parcels totaling approximately 14.3 acres located on the west side of Interstate 95. The Company had a cost basis of effectively $0 in the donated land and paid approximately $100,000 to satisfy the community development district bonds associated with the acreage. As part of the Golf Course Land Purchase the Company was obligated to pay the City additional consideration in the form of an annual surcharge of $1 per golf round played at the Club each year (the Per-Round Surcharge\u201d) with an annual minimum Per-Round Surcharge of $70,000 and a maximum aggregate amount of the Per-Round Surcharges paid equal to $700,000. The maximum amount of $700,000 represents contingent consideration and was recorded as an increase in Golf Buildings, Improvements, and Equipment and Accrued and Other Liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In connection with the Golf Sale the Company paid off the remaining obligation which totaled $560,000. The Company also, as part of the Golf Course Land Purchase, was required to renovate the greens on one of the courses at the Club and such renovations were completed in the third quarter of 2017.\nThe Golf Course Land Purchase also required that if the Company sold the Club within six years of the closing of the Golf Course Land Purchase, the Company would be obligated to pay the City an amount equal to 10% of the difference between the sales price, less closing costs and any other costs required to be incurred in connection with the sale, and $4.0 million. Based on the sales price of the Golf Sale, the Company's obligation under this provision terminated.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company wrote down the value of the golf assets comprising the Club, which resulted in a corresponding impairment charge of approximately $1.1 million, or $0.15", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW\nForward-Looking Statements\nWhen the Company uses any words such as anticipate,\u201d assume,\u201d believe,\u201d estimate,\u201d expect,\u201d intend,\u201d or similar expressions, the Company is making forward-looking statements. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon current expectations and reasonable assumptions, the Company's actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Certain factors or risks that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those the Company anticipates or projects are described in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Given these uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any document incorporated herein by reference. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRecent Developments Impacting our Business\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company completed the following transactions that were transformational to the Company and its operating results for the year ended December 31, 2019 and meaningful to its ongoing operations in the periods subsequent to December 31, 2019:\n \u00b7 Land JV Transaction \nOn October 16, 2019, the Company completed the sale of a controlling interest in its wholly-owned subsidiary, Crisp39 SPV LLC to affiliates of Magnetar Capital LLC (the Magnetar Land Sale\u201d); (i) Flacto, LLC ( Flacto\u201d); (ii) Magnetar Longhorn Fund LP ( Longhorn\u201d); and (iii) Magnetar Structured Credit Fund, LP ( Magnetar SCF\u201d and collectively with Flacto and Longhorn, the Magnetar Investors\u201d) pursuant to an Interest Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d), for $97 million. Crisp39 SPV LLC holds the approximately 5,300 acres of undeveloped land in Daytona Beach, Florida (the Land JV\u201d). Following the closing of the Purchase Agreement, the Magnetar Investors collectively own a notional 66.50% equity interest in the Land JV, and the Company owns a notional 33.50% equity interest in the Land JV (collectively, the Company and the Magnetar Investors are herein referred to as the JV Partners\u201d). The transaction resulted in a gain of approximately $78.6 million, or approximately $12.21 per share, after tax, on the sale of the 66.50% equity interest in the Land JV and a non-cash gain of approximately $48.9 million on the Company's retained interest in the Land JV, or approximately $7.59 per share, after tax.\nThe Company serves as the manager (the Manager\u201d) of the Land JV and is responsible for day-to-day operations at the direction of the JV Partners. All major decisions and certain other actions must be approved by the unanimous consent of the JV Partners (the Unanimous Actions\u201d). Unanimous Actions include the approval of pricing for all land parcels in the Land JV; approval of contracts for the sale of land that contain material revisions to the standard purchase contract of the Land JV; entry into any lease agreement affiliated with the Land JV; entering into listing or brokerage agreements; approval and amendment of the Land JV's operating budget; obtaining financing for the Land JV; admission of additional members; and dispositions of the Land JV's real property for amounts less than market value. Pursuant to the Limited Liability Agreement of the Land JV will pay the Manager a management fee in the initial amount of $20,000 per month, which amount will be evaluated on a quarterly basis and reduced based on the value of real property that remains in the Land JV.\nAs a result of the Magnetar Land Sale, the Company has effectively divested all of its land holdings and as such the impact of the occurrence of land sales, which had been a primary element of the Company's business for virtually its entire history, has been essentially eliminated. In addition, the need for utilizing the 1031 like-kind exchange structure to deploy proceeds from land sales into replacement assets, primarily income properties, has also been reduced substantially.\n\t\t\n \u00b7 Alpine Income Property Trust, Inc. (NYSE: PINE) \nOn November 26, 2019, as part of the initial public offering (the IPO\u201d) of Alpine Income Property Trust, Inc. ( PINE\u201d) on the New York Stock Exchange, the Company and certain of its affiliates entered into purchase and sale agreements with PINE and Alpine Income Property OP, LP (the PINE OP\u201d), pursuant to which the Company and such affiliates sold, and PINE or the PINE OP purchased, 15 properties for aggregate cash consideration of $125.9 million (collectively, the Purchase and Sale Transaction\u201d). In addition, the Company and certain of its affiliates entered into contribution agreements with the PINE OP, pursuant to which the Company and such affiliates contributed to the PINE OP five properties (the Contributed Properties\u201d) for an aggregate of 1,223,854 OP units of the PINE OP (the OP Units\u201d), which have an initial value of approximately $23.3 million (the Contribution Transaction\u201d), and collectively with the Purchase and Sale Transaction, (the PINE Income Property Sale Transactions\u201d). The PINE Income Property Sale Transactions resulted in a gain of approximately $1.0 million, or approximately $0.16 per share, after tax.\nConcurrently with the PINE Income Property Sale Transactions, the Company purchased 394,737 shares of PINE common stock for a total purchase price of $7.5 million (the Private Placement\u201d). Also, on November 26, 2019, the Company purchased 421,053 shares of PINE common stock in the IPO for a total purchase price of $8.0 million (the IPO Purchase\u201d and together with the Private Placement, the Equity Transactions\u201d). Including the Company's investment in PINE as a result of receiving 1,223,854 OP Units, the Company owns, in the aggregate, approximately 2.04 million shares of PINE common stock, or approximately 22.3% of PINE's total shares outstanding.\nIn addition to the PINE Income Property Sale Transactions, the PINE IPO was significant for the Company and our business because concurrent with the PINE IPO, the Company entered into a management agreement with PINE (the Management Agreement\u201d) pursuant to which the Company is responsible for managing, operating, and administering the day-to-day operations, business and affairs of PINE, subject to the direction and supervision of PINE's board of directors (the PINE Board\u201d) and in accordance with the investment guidelines approved and monitored by the PINE Board. Pursuant to the Management Agreement, PINE agreed to pay the Company a base management fee equal to 0.375% per quarter (or 1.5% annually) of PINE's total equity\u201d (as defined in the Management Agreement) calculated and payable in cash, quarterly in arrears. Based on the equity raised in PINE's IPO and the Private Placement, the initial base management fee would approximate $2.6 million. In addition, we have the ability to earn an incentive fee based on PINE's shareholders achieving an annual return that exceeds an 8% annual hurdle, subject to a high-water mark price. The amount of the incentive fee would equal 15% of the amount by which the PINE shareholders annual return exceeds 8% in any given year. The initial term of the Management Agreement is five (5) years and the Management Agreement cannot be terminated by either party during the initial term except for certain definitive events which pertain primarily to our default or lack of performance. We also entered into an exclusivity and right of first offer agreement (the Exclusivity and ROFO Agreement\u201d) with PINE at the date of its IPO. Pursuant to the Exclusivity and ROFO Agreement the Company agreed not to invest in single-tenant net lease income properties, with limited exceptions. Further, the Company agreed to provide PINE with a right of first offer should the Company decided to sell any of its remaining portfolio of single-tenant net leased income properties in the future.\n \u00b7 Golf Operations \nOn October 17, 2019, the Company sold its interest in the golf operations for $3.45 million (the Golf Sale\u201d), resulting in no gain on the transaction. The Company provided the buyer with financing in the form of an approximately $2.1 million first mortgage loan with a term of one year. As a result of the sale of the golf operations, the Company is no longer engaged in the ownership and operation of LPGA or any other golf club business.\n\t\t\nOur Business\nWe are a diversified real estate operating company that was founded in 1910. As of December 31, 2019, we own and manage, sometimes utilizing third-party property management companies, thirty-four commercial real estate properties in eleven states in the United States, with approximately 1.8 million square feet of gross leasable space. These thirty-four properties in our portfolio comprise our income property operations segment.\nIn addition to our income property portfolio, as of December 31, 2019, or business included the following:\nManagement Services:\n \u00b7 A fee-based management business that is engaged in managing PINE and the Land JV, see Note 5, Related Party Management Services Business\u201d. \nCommercial Loan Investments:\n \u00b7 A portfolio of commercial loan investments. \nReal Estate Operations:\n \u00b7 A portfolio of mineral interests consisting of approximately 455,000 subsurface acres in 20 counties in the state of Florida and a portfolio of mitigation credits; \n \u00b7 A retained interest in the Land JV which is seeking to sell approximately 5,300 acres of undeveloped land in Daytona Beach, Florida; and \n \u00b7 An interest in a joint venture (the Mitigation Bank JV\u201d) that owns an approximately 2,500 acre parcel of land in the western part of Daytona Beach, Florida which is engaged in the operation of a mitigation bank, which, pursuant to a mitigation plan approved by the applicable state and federal authorities, produces mitigation credits that are marketed and sold to developers of land in the Daytona Beach area for the purpose of enabling the developers to obtain certain regulatory permits. \nOur business also includes, as outlined above, our investment in PINE of approximately $38.8 million resulting from the Equity Transactions, or approximately 22.3% of the PINE's outstanding equity, including the OP Units which are exchangeable into common stock of PINE on a one-for-one basis, at PINE's election. Our investment in PINE should generate investment income through the dividends distributed by PINE. In addition to the dividends we receive from PINE, our investment in PINE may benefit from any appreciation in PINE's stock price, although no assurances can be provided that such appreciation will occur, the amount by which our investment will increase in value, or the timing thereof. Any dividends received from PINE are included in Investment Income on the accompanying statement of operations.\nPrior to 2019, the Company operated in four primary business segments: income properties, commercial loan investments, real estate operations, and golf operations. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company commenced efforts to monetize the golf operations and accordingly, as of December 31, 2018, the golf assets and liabilities related to the golf operations were classified as held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the results of golf operations were classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for all years presented. The golf operations segment, although discontinued in 2018, held assets as of December 31, 2018. Accordingly, the identifiable assets and liabilities have been disclosed separately as discontinued golf operations for the years presented.\nAs a result of the significant transactions during the fourth quarter of 2019, including the Land JV transaction, the PINE Income Property Sale Transactions, and the Golf Sale, the Company's segment structure has been modified to more closely align with the continuing operations of the Company. The Company now operates in four primary business segments: income properties, management services, commercial loan investments, and real estate operations. The new management services segment consists of the revenue generated from managing PINE and the Land JV. The management services segment had no assets as of December 31, 2019, 2018, or 2017. The real estate operations segment previously included land sales from the Daytona Beach land portfolio as well as revenue and expenses related to the sale of mitigation credits and subsurface operations. Upon the completion of the Land JV transaction in the fourth quarter of 2019, the real estate operations related to land sales have been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 and the continuing real estate operations segment remaining consists of subsurface operations and mitigation credit sales. The identifiable assets and liabilities related to the discontinued real estate operations have been separately disclosed as discontinued real estate operations for the years presented.\n\t\t\nThe

properties occupied by retail or office tenants. We may also self-develop multi-tenant income properties, as we have done in the past. We may also invest in commercial loans or similar financings secured by commercial real estate. Our investment in multi-tenant income properties, and possibly single-tenant net lease assets that fall outside our Exclusivity and ROFO agreement with PINE, may utilize proceeds from the sale of an income property currently in our portfolio and because our tax basis in property likely carries a tax basis from the low-basis land parcel we sold to by the existing property, we may seek to have the sale of the existing income property qualify for income tax deferral through the like-kind exchange provisions under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code. The low tax basis in our income property portfolio is the result of us having acquired the original land primarily in the early part of our 100 plus year history. Utilizing the like-kind exchange structure allows us to continue to defer the related income taxes on the original gains from the land sales and possibly the gains achieved on the sale of the original replacement property or properties. Generally, in order to utilize the like-kind exchange structure, we are prohibited from engaging in activities that are typically indicative of the developer of an income property or a dealer in income property sales. Our approach in investing in income-producing real estate is to use leverage, when appropriate or necessary, to fund our acquisitions and to help achieve our business objectives. Our use of leverage in acquiring income-producing real estate is intended to provide positive returns relative to our borrowing costs. We believe this enhances our Company's income-generating real estate asset base while keeping us cash flow positive.\nOur investment strategy seeks to acquire income properties, primarily multi-tenants, which will continue to broaden the credit base of our lease tenants, diversify our income property portfolio geographically, with an emphasis on major markets and growth markets in the U.S., and diversify the type of income-producing property. We may selectively choose to complete the development of an income property investment.\n\t\t\nProceeds from completed sales of income properties supply us with investible capital. Our access to sources of debt financing, particularly our borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility, also provide a source of capital for our investment strategy. Our strategy is to utilize leverage, when appropriate and necessary, and potentially proceeds from sales of income properties, the disposition or payoffs of our commercial loan investments, and certain transactions involving our Subsurface Interests, to acquire income properties. We may also acquire or originate commercial loan investments, invest in securities of real estate companies, or make other shorter-term investments. Our targeted investment classes may include the following:\n \u00b7 Multi-tenant office and retail properties in major metropolitan areas and growth markets, typically stabilized; \n \u00b7 Single-tenant retail and office, double or triple net leased, properties in major metropolitan areas and growth markets that are compliant with our commitments under the Exclusivity and ROFO agreement; \n \u00b7 Purchase or origination of ground leases, that are compliant with our commitments under the Exclusivity and ROFO agreement; \n \u00b7 Self-developed properties comprised of select office, flex, industrial, and retail; \n \u00b7 Joint venture development using land owned by the Land JV; \n \u00b7 Origination or purchase of commercial loan investments with loan terms of 1-10 years with strong risk-adjusted yields secured by property types to include hotel, office, retail, residential, land and industrial; \n \u00b7 Select regional area investments using Company market knowledge and expertise to earn strong risk-adjusted yields; and \n \u00b7 Real estate-related investment securities, including commercial mortgage-backed securities, preferred or common stock, and corporate bonds. \nOur investments in income-producing properties are typically subject to long-term leases. For multi-tenant properties, each tenant typically pays its proportionate share of the aforementioned operating expenses of the property, although for such properties we typically incur additional costs for property management services. Single-tenant leases are typically in the form of triple or double net leases and ground leases. Triple-net leases generally require the tenant to pay property operating expenses such as real estate taxes, insurance, assessments and other governmental fees, utilities, repairs and maintenance, and capital expenditures.\nINCOME PROPERTIES\nWe have pursued a strategy of investing in income-producing properties, when possible, by utilizing the proceeds from real estate transactions, including the disposition of income properties and transactions involving our Subsurface Interests.\nOur strategy for investing in income-producing properties is focused on factors including, but not limited to, long-term real estate fundamentals and target markets, including major markets or those markets experiencing significant economic growth. We employ a methodology for evaluating targeted investments in income-producing properties which includes an evaluation of: (i) the attributes of the real estate (e.g. location, market demographics, comparable properties in the market, etc.); (ii) an evaluation of the existing tenant(s) (e.g. credit-worthiness, property level sales, tenant rent levels compared to the market, etc.); (iii) other market-specific conditions (e.g. tenant industry, job and population growth in the market, local economy, etc.); and (iv) considerations relating to the Company's business and strategy (e.g. strategic fit of the asset type, property management needs, alignment with the Company's 1031 like-kind exchange structure, etc.).\nWe believe investment in each of these income-producing asset classes provides attractive opportunities for stable current cash flows and increased returns in the long run and the potential for capital appreciation.\n\t\t\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company acquired ten single-tenant income properties and one multi-tenant income property, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $164.7 million as described below:\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTenant Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTenant Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nProperty Location\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDate of Acquisition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nProperty Square-Feet\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nProperty Acres\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPurchase Price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercentage Leased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRemaining Lease Term at Acquisition Date (in years)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nHobby Lobby Stores, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSingle-Tenant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWinston-Salem, NC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n05/16/19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n55,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n8,075,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n24 Hour Fitness USA, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSingle-Tenant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFalls Church, VA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n05/23/19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n46,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n21,250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWalgreen Co.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSingle-Tenant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBirmingham, AL\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n06/05/19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9.8\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFamily Dollar Stores of Massachusetts, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSingle-Tenant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLynn, MA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n06/07/19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.8\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWalgreen Co.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSingle-Tenant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAlbany, GA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n06/21/19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,634,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCarpenter Hotel (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSingle-Tenant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAustin, TX\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n07/05/19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nN/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n16,250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n99.1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeneral Dynamics Corporation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSingle-Tenant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nReston, VA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n07/12/19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n64,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18,600,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9.9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLive Nation Entertainment, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSingle-Tenant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEast Troy, WI\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n08/30/19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nN/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n158.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nParty City Corporation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSingle-Tenant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOceanside, NY\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n09/24/19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,120,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBurlington Stores, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSingle-Tenant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nN.

Pursuant to FASB ASC Topic 842, Leases, the $16.25 million investment has been recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 as a commercial loan investment. See Note 4, Commercial Loan Investments\u201d.\nIn addition to the 20 single-tenant net lease properties sold to PINE in November 2019, the Company completed the sale of four other income properties during the year ended December 31, 2019. In February 2019, the Company sold its approximately 59,000 square foot multi-tenant retail property located in Sarasota, Florida that was anchored by a Whole Foods Market grocery store, for approximately $24.6 million. In May 2019, the Company sold its approximately 112,000 square foot retail strip center, anchored by a 24-Hour Fitness, for approximately $18.3 million. In June 2019, the Company sold its approximately 76,000 square foot multi-tenant office property in Santa Clara, California for approximately $37 million. And finally, in August of 2019, the Company sold its property that was subject to a ground lease with WaWa for approximately $2.8 million. In aggregate, the four dispositions generated approximately $82.6 million in proceeds with gains recognized of approximately $20.8 million, or approximately $3.06 per share, after tax.\nOur current portfolio of twenty-nine (29) single-tenant income properties generates approximately $20.4 million of revenues from straight-line base lease payments on an annualized basis and had a weighted average remaining lease term of 9.1 years as of December 31, 2019. Our current portfolio of five (5) multi-tenant properties generates approximately $8.9 million of revenue from straight-line base lease payments on an annualized basis and had a weighted average remaining lease term of 6.5 years as of December 31, 2019.\nAs part of our overall strategy for investing in income-producing properties, we have self-developed properties, including five multi-tenant office properties, all of which are located in Daytona Beach, Florida. We sold one these properties in 2016 and the four other properties on March 26, 2018.\nWe also self-developed two single-tenant net lease restaurant properties on a 6-acre beachfront parcel in Daytona Beach, Florida. The development was completed in January of 2018 and rent commenced from both tenants pursuant to their separate leases. On a limited basis, we have acquired and may continue to selectively acquire other real estate, either vacant land or land with existing structures, that we would demolish and develop into additional income properties, possibly in the downtown and beachside areas of Daytona Beach, Florida. Through December 31, 2019, we invested approximately $5.2 million to acquire approximately 6.0 acres in downtown Daytona Beach that is located in an opportunity zone. Specifically, our investments in the Daytona Beach area would target opportunistic acquisitions of select catalyst sites, which are typically distressed, with an objective of having short investment horizons. Should we pursue such acquisitions, we may seek to partner with developers to develop these sites rather than self-develop the properties.\nOur focus on acquiring income-producing investments includes a continual review of our existing income property portfolio to identify opportunities to recycle our capital through the sale of income properties based on, among other possible factors, the current or expected performance of the property and favorable market conditions. In the recent past, the Company was pursuing an effort to the monetize certain of our multi-tenant income properties with the Company intending to reinvest the potential proceeds from these dispositions into single-tenant net lease income properties. As a result of that strategy, we sold three multi-tenant income properties during the year ended December 31, 2019. In part, as a result of entering into the Exclusivity and ROFO Agreement, our income property investment strategy will be focused primarily on multi-tenant retail and office properties. We may pursue this strategy, in part, by monetizing certain of our\n\t\t\nsingle-tenant properties, and should we do so, we would seek to utilize the 1031 like-kind exchange structure to preserve the tax-deferred gain on the original transaction(s) that pertains to the replacement asset.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company owned twenty-nine single-tenant and five multi-tenant income properties in eleven states.

option periods beyond the original term of the lease, which typically are exercisable at the tenant's option.\nWe had one tenant that accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated income property revenue during the year ended December 31, 2019. Wells Fargo, who occupied two single-tenant office properties located in Hillsboro, Oregon and Raleigh, North Carolina, accounted for approximately 12.5% of our consolidated revenues during the year ended December 31, 2019. The office property leased to Wells Fargo located in Hillsboro, Oregon was sold as a part of the PINE Income Property Sale Transactions on November 26, 2019. The office property leased to Wells Fargo located in Raleigh, North Carolina also represented 26% of the total square footage of our income property portfolio as of December 31, 2019. A default by this tenant would have a material adverse effect on the Company's income properties segment and its overall results of operations. We have one other tenant, Fidelity Investments, who represented over 5% of our consolidated revenues during the year ended December 31, 2019, and a large percentage of the square footage of our income property portfolio, but not in excess of 10%.\nMANAGEMENT SERVICES BUSINESS\nOur business plans also include generating revenue from managing PINE and the Land JV. Pursuant to the Management Agreement, we will generate a base management fee equal to 1.5% of PINE's total equity. The structure of the base fee provides us with an opportunity for our base fee to grow should PINE's independent board members determine to raise additional equity capital in the future. We also have an opportunity to achieve additional cash flows as Manager of PINE pursuant to the terms of the incentive fee.\nThe Company also generates management fees as the Land JV Manager. Pursuant to the terms of the operating agreement for the Land JV, the initial amount of the management fee is $20,000 per month. The management fee is evaluated quarterly and as land sales occur in the Land JV, the basis for our management fee will be reduced as the management fee is based on the value of real property that remains in the Land JV.\nCOMMERCIAL LOAN INVESTMENTS\nOur investments in commercial loans or similar structured finance investments, such as mezzanine loans or other subordinated debt, have been and are expected to continue to be secured by commercial or residential real estate or the borrower's pledge of its ownership interest in the entity that owns the real estate. The first mortgage loans we invest in or originate are generally for commercial real estate located in the United States and its territories and are current or performing with either a fixed or floating rate. Some of these loans may be syndicated in either a pari-passu or senior/subordinated structure. Commercial first mortgage loans generally provide for a higher recovery rate due to their senior position in the underlying collateral. Commercial mezzanine loans are typically secured by a pledge of the borrower's equity ownership in the underlying commercial real estate. Unlike a mortgage, a mezzanine loan is not secured\n\t\t\nby a lien on the property. An investor's rights in a mezzanine loan are usually governed by an intercreditor agreement that provides holders with the rights to cure defaults and exercise control on certain decisions of any senior debt secured by the same commercial property.\n2019 Commercial Loan Investment Portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company invested approximately $18.3 million on three commercial loans, two were mortgage notes of $8 million and $8.25 million secured by a parcel of land in Orlando, Florida and a full-service hotel in Austin, Texas, respectively. In addition, in connection with the sale of the Company's golf operations, the Company provided an approximately $2.1 million loan to the buyer, with a maturity of one year and an interest rate of 7.5%. As of December 31, 2019, the Company's commercial loan investment portfolio included the three loans with a total remaining principal balance of approximately $18.2 million, a weighted average interest rate of approximately 11.3% and a remaining duration to maturity of approximately 0.5 years.\n2018 Commercial Loan Investment Portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company had two loan investments totaling approximately $11.9 million, that were repaid in full at maturity. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had no commercial loan investments.\n2017 Commercial Loan Investment Portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company invested in a $3 million loan on a parcel of land in Daytona Beach that was being developed into a multi-family condominium property. As of December 31, 2017, the Company's commercial loan investment portfolio included two loans with a total remaining principal balance of approximately $11.9 million, a weighted average interest rate of 9.5% and a remaining duration to maturity of approximately 0.5 years. During the year a $10 million mezzanine loan investment secured by a hotel located at the Dallas/Fort Worth airport in Texas and a $5 million mezzanine loan investment secured by a hotel located in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, were paid off in full.\nLAND and INVESTMENT IN THE LAND JV\nLand JV. As noted above, the direct impact of the Magnetar Land Sale is that the Company divested itself of its land holdings, but for the 6-acre Daytona Beach development land described below, and as such the occurrence of land sales, which had been a primary element of the Company's business for virtually its entire 109-year history, has been essentially discontinued. Consequently, the operations associated with our land holdings were treated as discontinued operations and accordingly the revenues and expenses that had been presented within the Company's real estate operations segment in prior periods were reclassified in the statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 and all prior periods presented.\nHowever, the Company is continuing to pursue land sales on the approximately 5,300 acres that formerly comprised its land holdings in its role as Manager (of the Land JV) on behalf of the JV Partners. The Company's retained interest in the Land JV represents a notional 33.5% stake in the venture, the value of which may be realized in the form of distributions based on the timing and the amount of proceeds achieved when the land is ultimately sold by the Land JV. As of March 6, 2020, the Land JV has completed approximately $22 million in land sales since its inception in mid-October 2019 and currently has a pipeline of 10 purchase and sale agreements for potential land sale transactions representing approximately $97 million of potential proceeds to the Land JV. The 4,200 acres under contract represents approximately 84% of the total remaining land in the Land JV.\nDaytona Beach Development. We may selectively acquire other real estate in Daytona Beach, Florida. We may target either vacant land or land with existing structures that we would raze and develop into additional income properties. During 2018, the Company acquired a 5-acre parcel of land with existing structures in downtown Daytona Beach, for a purchase price of approximately $2.0 million. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has also acquired other contiguous parcels totaling approximately 1-acre for approximately $2.1 million. Combined, these parcels represent the substantial portion of an entire city block in downtown Daytona Beach adjacent to International Speedway Boulevard, a major thoroughfare in Daytona Beach. The combined 6 acres is located in an opportunity zone and a community redevelopment area. In addition, this property is proximate to the future headquarters of Brown & Brown Inc., the sixth largest insurance broker in the U.S. and a publicly listed company that is expected to be occupied by at least 600 of their employees. We have engaged a national real estate brokerage firm to assist us in identifying a developer or investor to acquire a portion or all of the property or to contribute into a potential joint venture to redevelop the property. We are pursuing entitlements for the potential redevelopment of these parcels, along with certain other adjacent land parcels, some of which we have under contract for purchase. As of December 31, 2019, we have incurred approximately $1.1 million in raze and entitlement costs related to these parcels. Our intent for investments in the Daytona Beach area is to target opportunistic acquisitions\n\t\t\nof select catalyst sites, which are typically distressed, with the objective of short-to-medium investment horizons. We may enter into joint ventures or other partnerships to develop land we have acquired or may acquire in the future in lieu of self-developing.\nRevenue from Tomoka Town Center. During 2015 and 2016, the Company completed three land sales with a gross sales price totaling approximately $21.4 million, with Tanger Outlets ( Tanger\u201d), Sam's Club ( Sams\u201d), and North American Development Group ( NADG\u201d), representing the sale of approximately 235 acres of land that is now the location of a Tanger Outlet mall, a Sam's Club retail property and a retail power center called the Tomoka Town Center. As part of the three land sale agreements and subsequent land sales with NADG, the Company performed certain infrastructure work, which began in the fourth quarter of 2015 and was completed in the fourth quarter of 2016, for which the Company would be reimbursed for the cost of the infrastructure work. The Company received NADG's portion of the reimbursement as NADG closed on each parcel of land included in the respective land sales contracts with the Company. Tanger and Sam's agreed to pay their reimbursement of the infrastructure costs over a ten-year period. The reimbursements applicable to and due from Tanger and Sam's totaled approximately $2.8 million. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has received approximately $1.1 million of the Tanger and Sam's reimbursements. These reimbursements are included in the results of the land operations which are now reflected in discontinued operations and will be through the final payment of Tanger's and Sam's reimbursement obligation.\nSince the transition in our land operations occurred late in 2019, the impact of land sales for the periods prior to October 2019 are no longer germane to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As such the following summarized information is provided regarding land sales activity prior to October 2019.\n2019 Land Sales. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company completed five (5) land sales transactions, including: (i) the Magnetar Land Sale for approximately 5,300 acres of land, for total proceeds of approximately $97 million; (ii) two transactions with Unicorp Development representing approximately 23.6 acres and generating aggregate proceeds of approximately $7.1 million; (iii) the sale of approximately 38 acres for total proceeds of $710,000, and (iv) a land sale to NADG for approximately 13 acres generating proceeds of approximately $3 million. In total the Company, in 2019, sold approximately 5,400 acres generating proceeds of approximately $108 million. Including the approximately $48.9 million recognized on the retained interest in the Land JV, gains of approximately $133 million, or approximately $20.60 per share after tax, were recognized.\n2018 Land Sales. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company completed land transactions representing approximately 2,697 acres including: (i) the sale of a 70% interest in the Mitigation Bank (hereinafter defined) that holds approximately 2,492 acres for proceeds of $15.3 million and (ii) twelve land sales totaling approximately 205 acres for aggregate proceeds of approximately $43.7 million. The twelve land sales generated gains of approximately $32.6 million, or approximately $4.44 per share, after tax.\n2017 Land Sales. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company completed land transactions representing approximately 1,700 acres including: (i) the sale of nearly 1,600 acres to Minto Communities generating proceeds of approximately $27.2 million; (ii) two transactions with NADG of approximately 46 acres for total proceeds of approximately $10.6 million, and (iii) five other transactions representing approximately 73.5 acres that generated approximately $9.2 million of proceeds. The land sales in 2017 generated aggregate proceeds of approximately $45.5 million and gains of approximately $31.8 million, or approximately $3.51 per share, after tax.\nLand Impairments. As more fully described in Note 11, \"Impairment of Long-Lived Assets,\" during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company did not recognize any impairments on its undeveloped land holdings.\nMitigation Bank. The mitigation bank transaction consists of the sale of a 70% interest in the entity that holds approximately 2,492 acres of land that has been permitted for the creation of a wetland mitigation bank (the Mitigation Bank JV\u201d). The purchaser of the 70% interest in the Mitigation Bank JV is comprised of certain funds and accounts managed by an investment advisor subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. ( BlackRock\u201d). The Company retained an approximately 30% non-controlling interest in the Mitigation Bank JV. A third-party was retained by the Mitigation Bank JV as the day-to-day manager of the Mitigation Bank property, responsible for the maintenance, generation, tracking, and other aspects of wetland mitigation credits.\n\t\t\nThe Mitigation Bank JV intends to engage in the creation and sale of both federal and state wetland mitigation credits. These credits will be created pursuant to the applicable permits that have been or will be issued to the Mitigation Bank JV from the federal and state regulatory agencies that exercise jurisdiction over the awarding of such credits, but no assurances can be given as to the ultimate issuance, marketability or value of the credits. The Mitigation Bank JV received the permit from the state regulatory agency on June 8, 2018 (the State Permit\u201d). The state regulatory agency may award up to 355 state credits under the State Permit. On August 6, 2018, the state regulatory agency awarded the initial 88.84 credits under the State Permit. Receipt of the remaining federal permit is anticipated to occur prior to the end of 2020.\nThe gain on the sale of the 70% interest in the Mitigation Bank totaled approximately $18.4 million and is comprised of the gain on the sale of 70% interest for proceeds of $15.3 million as well as the gain on the retained 30% interest pursuant to FASB ASC Topic 610-20, Other Income - Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets. The gain is included in the Gain on Disposition of Assets in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2018, the approximately $6.8 million Investments in Joint Ventures included on the Company's consolidated balance sheets is comprised of the fair market value of the 30% retained interest in the Mitigation Bank JV.\nThe operating agreement of the Mitigation Bank JV (the Operating Agreement\u201d) executed in conjunction with the mitigation bank transaction stipulates that the Company shall arrange for sales of the Mitigation Bank JV's mitigation credits to unrelated third parties totaling no less than $6 million of revenue to the Mitigation Bank JV, net of commissions, by the end of 2020, utilizing a maximum of 60 mitigation credits (the Minimum Sales Requirement\u201d). The Operating Agreement stipulates that if the Minimum Sales Requirement is not achieved, then BlackRock has the right, but is not required, to cause the Company to purchase the number of mitigation credits necessary to reach the Minimum Sales Requirement (the Minimum Sales Guarantee\u201d). The Company estimates the fair value of the Minimum Sales Guarantee to be approximately $100,000 which was recorded as a reduction in the gain on the transaction and is included in Accrued and Other Liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018.\nAdditionally, the Operating Agreement provides BlackRock the right to cause the Company to purchase a maximum of 8.536 mitigation credits per quarter (the Commitment Amount\u201d) from the Mitigation Bank JV at a price equal to 60% of the then fair market value for mitigation credits (the Put Right\u201d). The Put Right is applicable even if the Mitigation Bank JV has not yet been awarded a sufficient number of mitigation credits by the applicable federal and state regulatory agencies. Further, in any quarter that BlackRock does not exercise its Put Right, the unexercised Commitment Amount for the applicable quarter may be rolled over to future calendar quarters. However, the Operating Agreement also stipulates that any amount of third-party sales of mitigation credits will reduce the Put Rights outstanding on a one-for-one basis, if the sales price of the third-party sales equals or exceeds the prices stipulated by the Put Right. Further, any sales of mitigation credits to third parties at the requisite minimum prices in a quarter that exceeds the quarterly amount of the Put Right will reduce the Put Rights in future calendar quarters on a one-for-one basis. The maximum potential of future payments for the Company pursuant to the Put Right is approximately $27 million. The Company estimates the fair value of the Put Right to be approximately $200,000, which was recorded as a reduction in the gain on the transaction and is included in Accrued and Other Liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018. In December 2019, BlackRock exercised its Put Right and put 25 mitigation credits to the Company, which the Company purchased for approximately $1.9 million, or approximately $75,000 per credit. The credits acquired were included as an increase to Impact Fees and Mitigation Credits on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2019.\nOther Real Estate Assets. The Company owns mitigation credits with a cost basis of approximately $2.3 million as of December 31, 2019. The increase in mitigation credits includes the 25 credits acquired from the Mitigation Bank during December 2019 as described in Note 6, Land and Investments in the Land JV. There were no mitigation credit sales during the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company transferred mitigation credits with a basis of approximately $124,000 to the land acquired by Buc-ee's. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company sold mitigation credits for approximately $1.0 million, for a gain of approximately $882,000, or $0.12 per share, after tax. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company sold mitigation credits for approximately $1.6 million, for a gain of approximately $1.3 million, or $0.15 per share, after tax. Additionally, the Company recorded the transfer of mitigation credits with a cost basis of approximately $298,000 as a charge to direct cost of revenues of real estate operations during the year ended December 31, 2017, as more fully described in Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company received cash payments of approximately $338,000 and $519,000, respectively, for impact fees with a cost basis that was generally of equal value, with no such impact fee sales during the year ended December 31, 2019, as the balance of impact fees is only approximately $2,000. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2018, impact fees with a cost basis of approximately $72,000 were transferred to the beachfront restaurant leased to LandShark Bar & Grill.\n\t\t\nSubsurface Interests. As of December 31, 2019, the Company owns full or fractional subsurface oil, gas, and mineral interests underlying approximately 455,000 surface\u201d acres of land owned by others in 20 counties in Florida (the Subsurface Interests\u201d). The revenues generated by the portfolio of subsurface interests includes the sale of subsurface acres, the leasing of subsurface acres for mineral exploration activities, and payments made to the Company, typically by the owner of the surface acres, to compensate us for releasing our right to enter the surface acres to access our subsurface acres.\nPrior to September 2019, the Company leased certain of the Subsurface Interests to a mineral exploration organization for exploration. An eight-year oil exploration lease was executed in 2011 that covered a portion of our Subsurface Interests. On September 20, 2017, the Company amended the oil exploration lease to, among other things, extend the expiration of the original term for five additional years to the new expiration date of September 22, 2024. As a result, the lease was effectively comprised of thirteen one-year terms as the lessee had the option to terminate the lease at the end of each lease year. The lessee had previously exercised renewal options through the eighth year of the lease which ended on September 22, 2019. The Lessee elected not to renew the oil exploration lease beyond September 22, 2019. During the eight years the lease was active the annual lease payments were recognized as revenue ratably over the respective twelve-month lease period. During the lease term a number of the renewals included the payment of a drilling penalty by the Lessee. The non-refundable drilling penalty payments were recognized as revenue when earned, i.e. when the amount agreed upon was paid. Lease income generated by the annual lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the guaranteed lease term. For the years December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, lease income of approximately $598,000, approximately $807,000, and approximately $807,000 was recognized, respectively.\nLease payments on the respective acreages and drilling penalties received through lease year eight are as follows:\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAcreage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLease Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Approximate)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFlorida County\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLease Payment (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDrilling Penalty (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLease Year 1 - 9/23/2011 - 9/22/2012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n136,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLee and Hendry\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n913,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLease Year 2 - 9/23/2012 - 9/22/2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n136,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLee and Hendry\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n922,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLease Year 3 - 9/23/2013 - 9/22/2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n82,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nHendry\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,293,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,000,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLease Year 4 - 9/23/2014 - 9/22/2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n42,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nHendry\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,866,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n600,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLease Year 5 - 9/23/2015 - 9/22/2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n25,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nHendry\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,218,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n175,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLease Year 6 - 9/23/2016 - 9/22/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nHendry\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n806,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n150,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLease Year 7 - 9/23/2017 - 9/22/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nHendry\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n806,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n50,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLease Year 8 - 9/23/2018 - 9/22/2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nHendry\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n806,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n150,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n10,633,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,125,000\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Generally, cash payment for the Lease Payment and Drilling Penalty is received on or before the first day of the lease year. The Drilling Penalty, which is due within thirty days from the end of the prior lease year, is recorded as revenue when earned, i.e. when the amount is agreed upon, while the Lease Payment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective lease term. The oil exploration lease has not been renewed beyond September 22, 2019 and has effectively terminated. \nThere were no sales of subsurface acres during the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company sold approximately 38,750 acres of subsurface interests in Osceola County, Florida for approximately $2.1 million (the \"Osceola Subsurface Sale\"). The gain from the Osceola Subsurface Sale totaled approximately $2.08 million, or $0.23 per share, after tax.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company completed a transaction releasing our surface entry rights on approximately 600 acres in exchange for approximately $185,000 in cash and fee title to approximately 40 additional acres in Hendry County, valued at approximately $320,000. Including the non-cash value received, the gain from the transaction totaled approximately $435,000, or $0.06 per share, after tax. Additional cash payments for the release of surface entry rights during 2018 totaled approximately $73,000. The revenue from the release of surface entry rights during the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled approximately $2.1 million.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, the Company also received oil royalties from operating oil wells on 800 acres under a separate lease with a separate operator resulting in revenues received from oil royalties of approximately $42,000, $72,000, and $86,000, respectively.\n\t\t\nThe Company is not prohibited from selling any or all of its Subsurface Interests. The Company may release surface entry rights or other rights upon request of a surface owner for a negotiated release fee typically based on a percentage of the surface value. Should the Company complete a transaction to sell all or a portion of its Subsurface Interests or complete a release transaction, the Company may utilize the like-kind exchange structure in acquiring one or more replacement investments including income-producing properties. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company completed a transaction releasing our surface entry rights on approximately 600 acres in exchange for approximately $185,000 in cash and fee title to approximately 40 additional acres in Hendry County, valued at approximately $320,000. Including the non-cash value received, the gain from the transaction totaled approximately $435,000, or $0.06 per share, after tax. Additional cash payments for the release of surface entry rights during 2018 totaled approximately $73,000. Cash payments for the release of surface entry rights totaled approximately $104,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019, while there were no releases of surface entry rights during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nGOLF OPERATIONS\nThe Golf Sale closed in October 2019. Prior to October 2019, the Company owned the LPGA International Golf Club (the Club\u201d), a semi-private golf club consisting of two 18-hole championship golf courses, a three-hole practice facility, a clubhouse facility with food and beverage operations, and a fitness facility. The Club was managed by a third party.\nPrior to January 2017, the Company leased from the City of Daytona Beach, FL (the City\u201d) a large portion of the land underlying the Club (the Golf Course Lease\u201d). On January 24, 2017, the Company acquired the approximately 690 acres of land and improvements covered by the Golf Course Lease, for approximately $1.5 million (the Golf Course Land Purchase\u201d). In conjunction with the Golf Course Land Purchase, the Golf Course Lease was terminated. Therefore, during the first quarter of 2017, the Company eliminated the remaining accrued liability of approximately $2.2 million, resulting in the recognition of approximately $0.40 per share in non-cash earnings, or $0.24 per share after tax, which comprises the Golf Course Lease termination in the consolidated statements of operations. The $2.2 million consisted of approximately $1.7 million which reflects the acceleration of the remaining amount of accrued rent that was no longer owed to the City as a result of the Lease Amendment, which prior to the Golf Course Land Purchase was being recognized into income over the remaining lease term which was originally to expire in 2022. The remaining approximately $500,000 reflects the amount of rent accrued pursuant to the Golf Course Lease, as amended, which will no longer be owed to the City due to the lease termination on January 24, 2017.\nAs a part of the Golf Course Land Purchase, the Company donated to the City three land parcels totaling approximately 14.3 acres located on the west side of Interstate 95. The Company had a cost basis of effectively $0 in the donated land and paid approximately $100,000 to satisfy the community development district bonds associated with the acreage. As part of the Golf Course Land Purchase the Company was obligated to pay the City additional consideration in the form of an annual surcharge of $1 per golf round played at the Club each year (the Per-Round Surcharge\u201d) with an annual minimum Per-Round Surcharge of $70,000 and a maximum aggregate amount of the Per-Round Surcharges paid equal to $700,000. The maximum amount of $700,000 represents contingent consideration and was recorded as an increase in Golf Buildings, Improvements, and Equipment and Accrued and Other Liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In connection with the Golf Sale the Company paid off the remaining obligation which totaled $560,000. The Company also, as part of the Golf Course Land Purchase, was required to renovate the greens on one of the courses at the Club and such renovations were completed in the third quarter of 2017.\nThe Golf Course Land Purchase also required that if the Company sold the Club within six years of the closing of the Golf Course Land Purchase, the Company would be obligated to pay the City an amount equal to 10% of the difference between the sales price, less closing costs and any other costs required to be incurred in connection with the sale, and $4.0 million. Based on the sales price of the Golf Sale, the Company's obligation under this provision terminated.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company wrote down the value of the golf assets comprising the Club, which resulted in a corresponding impairment charge of approximately $1.1 million, or $0.15"}
