For more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following financial information, please see \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 1. Organization and Presentation and Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\"\nExecutive Overview\nWe are a diversified producer and marketer of coal primarily to major U.S. utilities and industrial users and were the first such producer and marketer in the nation to be a publicly traded master limited partnership. We are currently the second-largest coal producer in the eastern U.S. In 2016, we produced and sold 35.2 million and 36.7 million tons of coal, respectively. The coal we produced in 2016 was approximately 15.2% low-sulfur coal, 63.8% medium-sulfur coal and 21.0% high-sulfur coal. Based on market expectations, we classify low-sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of less than 1.5%, medium-sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of 1.5% to 3%, and high-sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of greater than 3%. The BTU content of our coal ranges from 11,400 to 13,200.\nWe operate eight underground mining complexes, including the Hamilton longwall mining complex in southern Illinois which we acquired on July 31, 2015 by purchasing the remaining equity ownership in White Oak and operate a coal-loading terminal on the Ohio River at Mt. Vernon, Indiana. Prior to July 31, 2015, we owned a non-controlling, preferred equity interest in White Oak, leased coal reserves to White Oak and owned and operated certain surface facilities at White Oak's mining complex. We also own the idled Onton mine and idled Gibson North mine. In addition, we own through our consolidated affiliate, Cavalier Minerals, an equity interest in AllDale Minerals for the purchase of oil and gas mineral interests in various geographic locations within producing basins in the continental U.S. and plan to make similar additional equity investments. At December 31, 2016, we had approximately 1.76 billion tons of proven and probable coal reserves in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. We believe we control adequate reserves to implement our currently contemplated mining plans. Please see \"Item 1. Business-Mining Operations\" for further discussion of our mines.\nIn 2016, approximately 90.3% of our sales tonnage was purchased by electric utilities, with the balance sold to third-party resellers and industrial consumers. Although many utility customers recently have appeared to favor a shorter-term contracting strategy, in 2016, approximately 87.7% of our sales tonnage was sold under long-term contracts. Our long-term contracts contribute to our stability and profitability by providing greater predictability of sales volumes and sales prices. In 2016, approximately 93.0% of our medium- and high-sulfur coal was sold to utility plants with installed pollution control devices. These devices, also known as scrubbers, eliminate substantially all emissions of sulfur dioxide.\nAs discussed in more detail in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors,\" our results of operations could be impacted by prices for items that are used in coal production such as steel, electricity and other supplies, unforeseen geologic conditions or mining and processing equipment failures and unexpected maintenance problems, and by the availability or reliability of transportation for coal shipments. Additionally, our results of operations could be impacted by our ability to obtain and renew permits necessary for our operations, secure or acquire coal reserves, or find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts. Moreover, the regulatory environment has grown increasingly stringent in recent years. As outlined in \"Item 1. Business-Regulation and Laws,\" a variety of measures taken by regulatory agencies in the U.S. and abroad in response to the perceived threat from climate change attributed to GHG emissions could substantially increase compliance costs for us and our customers and reduce demand for coal, which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations. For additional information regarding some of the risks and uncertainties that affect our business and the industry in which we operate, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\"\nOur principal expenses related to the production of coal are labor and benefits, equipment, materials and supplies, maintenance, royalties and excise taxes. We employ a totally union-free workforce. Many of the benefits of our union-free workforce are related to higher productivity and are not necessarily reflected in our direct costs. In addition, transportation costs may be substantial and are often the determining factor in a coal consumer's contracting decision.\nOur mining operations are located near many of the major eastern utility generating plants and on major coal hauling railroads in the eastern U.S. Our River View and Tunnel Ridge mines and Mt. Vernon transloading facility are located on the Ohio River and our idled Onton mine is located on the Green River in western Kentucky.\nOur primary business strategy is to create sustainable, capital-efficient growth in available cash to maximize distributions to our unitholders by:\nTable 172: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nexpanding our operations by adding and developing mines and coal reserves in existing, adjacent or neighboring properties;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nextending the lives of our current mining operations through acquisition and development of coal reserves using our existing infrastructure;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncontinuing to make productivity improvements to remain a low-cost producer in each region in which we operate;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nstrengthening our position with existing and future customers by offering a broad range of coal qualities, transportation alternatives and customized services;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ndeveloping strategic relationships to take advantage of opportunities within the coal industry and MLP sector; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nmaking equity investments for the purchase of oil and gas mineral interests in various geographic locations within producing basins in the continental U.S.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have two reportable segments: Illinois Basin and Appalachia, and an \"all other\" category referred to as Other and Corporate. Our reportable segments correspond to major coal producing regions in the eastern U.S. Factors similarly affecting financial performance of our operating segments within each of these two reportable segments generally include coal quality, geology, coal marketing opportunities, mining and transportation methods and regulatory issues.\nTable 178: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIllinois Basin reportable segment is comprised of multiple operating segments, including the following current operating mining complexes: a) Webster County Coal's Dotiki mining complex, b) Gibson County Coal's mining complex, which includes the Gibson North mine (currently idled) and Gibson South mine, c) Warrior's mining complex, d) River View's mining complex and e) the Hamilton mining complex. In April 2014, initial production began at the Gibson South mine. The Gibson North mine has been idled since the fourth quarter of 2015 in response to market conditions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Illinois Basin reportable segment also includes White County Coal's Pattiki mining complex, Hopkins County Coal's mining complex, which includes the Elk Creek mine, the Pleasant View surface mineable reserves and the Fies underground project, Sebree's mining complex, which includes the Onton mine, Steamport and certain Sebree reserves, CR Services, LLC, CR Machine Shop, LLC, certain properties and equipment of Alliance Resource Properties, ARP Sebree, LLC (\"ARP Sebree\"), ARP Sebree South, LLC, UC Coal, LLC and its subsidiaries, UC Mining, LLC, and UC Processing, LLC. The Pattiki mine ceased production in December 2016. The Elk Creek mine depleted its reserves in March 2016 and ceased production on April 1, 2016. The Sebree properties, the Pleasant View surface mineable reserves and the Fies underground project are held by us for future mine development. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we idled our Onton mine in response to market conditions. In the fourth quarter of 2014 and February 2015, Alliance Resource Properties acquired reserves that would allow increased production from our River View mine, add three new potential development projects for our organic growth strategy and may significantly extend the life of the Dotiki mine. UC Coal, LLC equipment assets acquired in 2015 continue being deployed as needed at various Illinois Basin operating mines. For information regarding the permitting process and matters that could hinder or delay the process, please read \"Item 1. Business-Regulation and Laws-Mining Permits and Approvals\".

Equity Investments\" for more information on AROP Funding, Alliance Minerals, Cavalier Minerals and AllDale Minerals.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nHow We Evaluate Our Performance\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operational measurements to analyze our performance. Primary measurements include the following: (1) raw and saleable tons produced per unit shift; (2) coal sales price per ton; (3) Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton; (4) EBITDA; and (5) Segment Adjusted EBITDA.\nRaw and Saleable Tons Produced per Unit Shift. We review raw and saleable tons produced per unit shift as part of our operational analysis to measure the productivity of our operating segments, which is significantly influenced by mining conditions and the efficiency of our preparation plants. Our discussion of mining conditions and preparation plant costs are found below under \"-Analysis of Historical Results of Operations\" and therefore provides implicit analysis of raw and saleable tons produced per unit shift.\nCoal Sales Price per Ton. We define coal sales price per ton as total coal sales divided by tons sold. We review coal sales price per ton to evaluate marketing efforts and for market demand and trend analysis.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per Ton. We define Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton (a non-GAAP financial measure) as the sum of operating expenses, outside coal purchases and other income divided by total tons sold. We review segment adjusted EBITDA expense per ton for cost trends.\nEBITDA. We define EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) as net income (prior to the allocation of noncontrolling interest) before net interest expense, income taxes and depreciation, depletion and amortization. EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by our management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others. We believe that the presentation of EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our performance and results of operations because EBITDA, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, (i) provides additional information about our core operating performance and ability to generate and distribute cash flow, (ii) provides investors with the financial analytical framework upon which we base financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions and (iii) presents a measurement that investors, rating agencies and debt holders have indicated is useful in assessing us and our results of operations.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA. We define Segment Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) as net income (prior to the allocation of noncontrolling interest) before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, asset impairment, acquisition gain, net and general and administrative expenses. Management therefore is able to focus solely on the evaluation of segment operating profitability as it relates to our revenues and operating expenses, which are primarily controlled by our segments.\nAnalysis of Historical Results of Operations\n2016 Compared with 2015\nWe reported net income of $339.5 million for 2016 compared to $306.2 million for 2015, an increase of $33.3 million. Comparative results between the years reflect in part the negative net impact in 2015 of $77.6 million of certain large non-cash items ( Non-Cash Items\u201d) described below and $48.5 million of equity in loss of affiliates related to White Oak also in 2015. Net income in 2016 was negatively impacted by reduced revenues compared to 2015 resulting from planned reductions in coal sales and production volumes, lower coal sales prices, lower other sales and operating revenues due to the absence of coal royalty and surface facilities revenues from White Oak in 2016, offset in part by reduced operating expenses in 2016. Lower operating expenses during 2016 primarily reflect decreased sales volumes and a favorable production cost mix resulting from our initiative to shift production to lower-cost per ton operations. Lower volumes in\n2016 resulted from idling our Onton and Gibson North mines in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the planned depletion of reserves at our Elk Creek mine in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by additional volumes from our Tunnel Ridge and Gibson South operations and the Hamilton mine acquired in the White Oak Acquisition. The Non-Cash Items in 2015 included asset impairments of $100.1 million offset in part by a net gain of $22.5 million related to final business combination accounting for the White Oak Acquisition.

Acquisitions.\" For more information on the 2015 non-cash asset impairments, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 4.

Coal sales decreased $296.2 million or 13.7% to $1.86 billion for 2016 from $2.16 billion for 2015. The decrease was attributable to a volume variance of $191.2 million resulting from reduced tons sold as discussed above and a price variance of $105.0 million due to lower average coal sales prices. Average coal sales prices decreased $2.86 per ton sold in 2016 to $50.76 compared to $53.62 per ton sold in 2015, primarily due to lower-priced legacy contracts at our Hamilton mine inherited in the White Oak Acquisition and lower average prices at certain mines, particularly at our Gibson South, Dotiki, Tunnel Ridge and MC Mining operations, as a result of challenging market conditions.\nOperating expenses and outside coal purchases. Operating expenses and outside coal purchases decreased 17.2% to $1.14 billion for 2016 from $1.38 billion for 2015 primarily as a result of the previously discussed reductions to coal production volumes and a favorable production cost mix. On a per ton basis, operating expenses and outside coal purchases decreased 9.1% to $31.09 per ton sold from $34.22 per ton sold in 2015, due primarily to the lower-cost production mix and higher productivity from our Tunnel Ridge and Gibson South mines. Operating expenses were impacted by various other factors, the most significant of which are discussed below:\nTable 182: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLabor and benefit expenses per ton produced, excluding workers' compensation, decreased 7.8% to $10.65 per ton in 2016 from $11.55 per ton in 2015. This decrease of $0.90 per ton was primarily attributable to the increased mix of lower-cost production discussed above and reduced overtime in response to market conditions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMaterial and supplies expenses per ton produced decreased 14.8% to $9.58 per ton in 2016 from $11.25 per ton in 2015. The decrease of $1.67 per ton produced resulted primarily from the increased mix of lower-cost production discussed above and related decreases of $0.77 per ton for roof support, $0.47 per ton for contract labor used in the mining process and $0.24 per ton for certain ventilation expenses partially offset by increases of $0.22 per ton for equipment rentals primarily due to equipment leases assumed in the White Oak Acquisition and $0.15 per ton for environmental and reclamation expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMaintenance expenses per ton produced decreased 21.1% to $3.10 per ton in 2016 from $3.93 per ton in 2015. The decrease of $0.83 per ton produced was primarily due to production variances at certain mines discussed above; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nProduction taxes and royalties expenses incurred as a percentage of coal sales prices and volumes decreased $0.39 per produced ton sold in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily as a result of lower excise taxes per ton resulting from a favorable state production mix and lower average coal sales prices discussed above;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating expenses and outside coal purchases per ton decreases discussed above were partially offset by the following increase:\nTable 186: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOperating expenses were increased by a 1.4 million ton inventory reduction and related inventory cost adjustments in 2016 as compared to a 1.0 million ton inventory increase and related inventory cost adjustments in 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther sales and operating revenues. Other sales and operating revenues were principally comprised of Mt. Vernon transloading revenues, Matrix Design sales, other outside services and administrative services revenue from affiliates and, in 2015, surface facility services and coal royalty revenues received from White Oak prior to the White Oak Acquisition in July 2015. Other sales and operating revenues decreased to $39.6 million in 2016 from $82.1 million in 2015. The decrease of $42.5 million was primarily due to the absence of coal royalty and surface facilities revenues from White Oak in 2016.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses for 2016 increased to $72.5 million compared to $67.5 million in 2015. The increase of $5.0 million was primarily due to higher incentive compensation expenses.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense (\"DD&A\") for 2016 decreased to $322.5 million compared to $333.7 million in 2015. The decrease of $11.2 million was primarily due to previously discussed volume reductions at our Onton, Gibson North and Elk Creek mines, partially offset by increases in DD&A associated with the acquisition of the Hamilton mine in July 2015 and at our Pattiki mine, which ceased production in December 2016.\nAsset impairment. In 2015, we recorded $100.1 million of impairment charges comprised of a $66.9 million impairment related to the idling of our Onton mine, a $19.5 million impairment at the MC Mining complex, primarily due to lower coal sales prices, and a $13.7 million impairment due to the surrender in 2015 of leases of undeveloped coal reserves and related property. No asset impairments were recorded in 2016.\nInterest expense. Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, decreased slightly to $30.7 million in 2016 from $31.2 million in 2015 primarily due to the repayment of our Series A senior notes in June 2015 offset in part by additional interest incurred under capital lease obligations. Interest payable under our senior notes, term loan, revolving credit facility and capital lease financings is discussed below under \"-Debt Obligations.\"\nEquity in income (loss) of affiliates. Equity in income (loss) of affiliates for 2016 includes Cavalier Minerals' equity investments in AllDale Minerals. In addition to AllDale Minerals, 2015 also includes our equity investment in White Oak. For 2016, we recognized equity in income of affiliates of $3.5 million compared to equity in loss of affiliates of $49.0 million for 2015. As discussed above, as a result of the White Oak Acquisition in July 2015, we no longer account for the Hamilton mine financial results as an equity investment in our consolidated financials, but now consolidate Hamilton in our financial results. Thus, the change in equity in earnings of affiliates was primarily due to the elimination of equity losses related to White Oak as well as an increase in equity earnings from AllDale Minerals.\nAcquisition gain, net. In 2015, we recognized a $22.5 million non-cash net gain related to the final business combination accounting for the White Oak Acquisition. For more information on the White Oak Acquisition, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 3. Acquisitions.\"\nTransportation revenues and expenses. Transportation revenues and expenses were $30.1 million and $33.6 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease of $3.5 million was primarily attributable to a decrease in average transportation rates in 2016, partially offset by increased tonnage for which we arrange transportation at certain mines. The cost of transportation services are passed through to our customers. Consequently, we do not realize any gain or loss on transportation revenues.\nSegment Information. Our 2016 Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 6.1% to $765.2 million from 2015 Segment Adjusted EBITDA of $814.7 million. Segment Adjusted EBITDA, tons sold, coal sales, other sales and operating revenues and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense by segment are as follows:\nTable 187: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Expenses.\"\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIllinois Basin - Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 12.8% to $538.1 million in 2016 from $617.1 million in 2015, a decrease of $79.0 million. Segment Adjusted EBITDA in 2016 was negatively impacted by reduced revenues compared to 2015 resulting from planned reductions in coal sales and production volumes, lower coal sales prices, lower other sales and operating revenues due to the absence of coal royalty and surface facilities revenues from White Oak in 2016, offset in part by reduced operating expenses in 2016. Comparative results between the years also reflect the negative impact in 2015 of $48.5 million of equity in loss of affiliates related to White Oak prior to the White Oak Acquisition in July 2015. Coal sales decreased 16.9% to $1.31 billion compared to $1.57 billion in 2015. The coal sales decrease of $264.8 million primarily reflects the previously discussed reduction of coal sales and production volumes at our Onton, Gibson North and Elk Creek mines, partially offset by additional volumes from our Gibson South operation and the Hamilton mine acquired in the White Oak Acquisition. Also impacting 2016 were lower average coal sales prices which decreased 4.8% to $48.54\nper ton sold compared to $51.01 per ton sold in 2015 as a result of challenging market conditions and lower-priced legacy contracts at the Hamilton mine inherited in the White Oak Acquisition. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense decreased 18.3% to $775.9 million in 2016 from $949.3 million in 2015 due to reduced production and sales volumes as discussed above. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton decreased $1.99 per ton sold to $28.83 in 2016 from $30.82 per ton sold in 2015, primarily as a result of a favorable production cost mix in 2016 due to reducing production from higher-cost per ton operations and improved recoveries at our Gibson South, River View and Warrior mines, as well as certain cost decreases described above under \"-Operating expenses and outside coal purchases.\"\nAppalachia - Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 4.2% to $191.7 million for 2016 from $183.9 million in 2015. The increase of $7.8 million was primarily attributable to increased tons sold and reduced operating expenses partially offset by lower average coal sales prices of $54.94 per ton sold during 2016 compared to $60.76 per ton sold in 2015. Coal sales decreased 6.7% to $534.8 million in 2016 compared to $573.5 million in 2015. The decrease of $38.7 million was primarily due to lower average coal sales prices at our MC Mining and Tunnel Ridge mines. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense decreased 13.5% to $346.5 million in 2016 from $400.7 million in 2015 and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton decreased $6.85 per ton sold to $35.60 compared to $42.45 per ton sold in 2015, primarily due to a favorable production cost mix resulting from an additional 1.0 million tons being produced from Tunnel Ridge in 2016 compared to 2015 and a reduction in volumes from our higher cost Appalachia mines. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton also benefited from fewer longwall move days and lower roof support expenses, lower selling expenses across the region, and certain other cost decreases described above under \"-Operating expenses and outside coal purchases.\"\nOther and Corporate - In 2016, Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $20.2 million compared to 2015 primarily as a result of increased margins on both safety equipment sales by Matrix Design and coal brokerage sales, as well as an increase in equity earnings from AllDale Minerals and a reduction in workers' compensation and pneumoconiosis accruals related to Pontiki which sold most of its assets in May 2014. In 2016, coal sales decreased $47.3 million and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense decreased $64.1 million compared to 2015. These decreases primarily resulted from reduced intercompany coal brokerage activity.\nElimination - Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense eliminations decreased in 2016 to $72.3 million from $127.2 million in 2015 and coal sales eliminations decreased to $65.4 million from $120.0 million, respectively, primarily reflecting reduced intercompany coal brokerage activity.\n2015 Compared with 2014\nWe reported net income of $306.2 million for 2015 compared to $497.2 million for 2014. The decrease of $191.0 million was principally due to non-cash asset impairments of $100.1 million, lower average coal sales prices particularly at our Appalachian segment mines, increased depreciation, depletion and amortization and higher equity in loss of affiliates, partially offset by record coal sales volumes, increased coal volumes at lower cost per ton operations, a net gain of $22.5 million related to the final business combination accounting for the White Oak Acquisition and increased other sales and operating revenues primarily reflecting higher surface facility services and coal royalties from White Oak prior to the White Oak Acquisition.

Coal sales decreased 2.3% to $2.16 billion for 2015 from $2.21 billion for 2014. The decrease of $50.6 million in coal sales reflected lower average coal sales prices, which reduced coal sales by $79.3 million, partially offset by the benefit of record tons sold, which contributed $28.7 million in additional coal sales. Average coal sales prices decreased by $1.97 to $53.62 per ton sold in 2015 compared to $55.59 per ton sold in 2014, primarily as a result of market conditions impacted by reduced coal demand at utilities due to low natural gas prices, regulatory pressures that caused\ncoal to gas switching or plant closures and high inventories. The decline in average sales prices was particularly noticeable for our Appalachian segment, decreasing $4.51 per ton to $60.75. In addition, average coal sales prices were impacted by lower-priced legacy contracts inherited in the White Oak Acquisition. Sales and production volumes rose to 40.2 million tons sold and 41.2 million tons produced in 2015 compared to 39.7 million tons sold and 40.7 million tons produced in 2014, primarily due to the addition of Hamilton production beginning August 1, 2015, the ramp up of coal production at our Gibson South mine following the commencement of operations in April 2014 and increased sales at our Tunnel Ridge and Mettiki mines. Volume increases were partially offset by lower sales at our Warrior, Gibson North, River View and Onton mines due to shift reductions, the shutdown of operations at our Gibson North and Onton mines in the fourth quarter of 2015 and scaled backed production at our Tunnel Ridge mine during the second half of 2015, all in response to weak coal demand, as well as an inventory build at several locations. In addition to shift reductions, reduced production from Warrior resulted from its continuing transition to a new mining area.\nOperating expenses and outside coal purchases. Operating expenses and outside coal purchases decreased 0.4% to $1.38 billion in 2015 remaining comparable to 2014. Decreases primarily resulted from a production scale-back at various mines discussed above, lower compensation expense and reduced selling expense resulting from lower coal sales prices and a favorable sales mix. These decreases were partially offset by increased operating expenses resulting from the assumption of operations at the Hamilton mine and a full year of production operations at our Gibson South mine. On a per ton basis, operating expenses and outside coal purchases decreased by 1.7% to $34.22 per ton sold in 2015 from $34.82 per ton sold in 2014, primarily as a result of lower operating expenses discussed above and increased coal volumes at lower cost per ton mines, partially offset by the impact of scaled back production at our Tunnel Ridge mine. Operating expenses were impacted by various other factors, the most significant of which are discussed below:\nTable 190: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLabor and benefit expenses per ton produced, excluding workers' compensation, decreased 1.5% to $11.55 per ton in 2015 from $11.72 per ton in 2014.

In May 2014, Pontiki completed the sale of most of its assets, including certain coal reserves, mining equipment and infrastructure and surface facilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther sales and operating revenues. Other sales and operating revenues are principally comprised of Mt. Vernon transloading revenues, Matrix Group sales, surface facility services and coal royalty revenues received from White Oak prior to the White Oak Acquisition and other outside services and administrative services revenue from affiliates. Other sales and operating revenues increased to $82.1 million for 2015 from $66.1 million for 2014. The increase of $16.0 million was primarily attributable to White Oak's start-up of longwall production and resulting increased surface facility services and coal royalty revenues prior to the White Oak Acquisition and increased revenues at our Mt. Vernon operations\nprimarily due to increased transloading fees from White Oak prior to the White Oak Acquisition, partially offset by decreased payments-in-lieu-of-shipments received from a customer related to an Appalachian coal supply agreement.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses for 2015 decreased to $67.5 million compared to $72.6 million in 2014. The decrease of $5.1 million was primarily due to lower incentive compensation expenses.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased to $333.7 million for 2015 from $274.6 million for 2014. The increase of $59.1 million was attributable to the reduction of the economic mine life at our Elk Creek mine, which closed near the end of the first quarter of 2016, increased production at the Gibson South mine, which commenced initial production in April 2014, amortization of coal supply agreements acquired in December 2014 and the addition of the Hamilton mine in late July 2015.\nAsset impairment. In 2015, we recorded $100.1 million of impairment charges comprised of a $66.9 million impairment related to the idling of our Onton mine, a $19.5 million impairment at the MC Mining complex, primarily due to lower coal sales prices, and a $13.7 million impairment due to the surrender in 2015 of leases of undeveloped coal reserves and related property.\nInterest expense. Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, decreased to $31.2 million in 2015 from $33.6 million in 2014. The decrease of $2.4 million was principally attributable to the repayment of our Series A senior notes in June 2015 partially offset by interest incurred on debt assumed in the White Oak Acquisition and an increase in the principal balance of our revolving credit facility. Our debt instruments are discussed in more detail below under \"-Debt Obligations.\"\nEquity in loss of affiliates. Equity in loss of affiliates for 2015 includes our equity investments in White Oak prior to the White Oak Acquisition and AllDale Minerals. In 2014, our equity investments also include MAC. For 2015, we recognized equity in loss of affiliates of $49.0 million compared to $16.6 million for 2014. The increase in equity in loss of affiliates is primarily due to low coal sales price realizations and higher expenses related to White Oak's ramp up of longwall operations in 2015 prior to the White Oak Acquisition and the impact of changes in allocations of equity income or losses resulting from reduced equity contributions during 2015 from another White Oak partner.\nAcquisition gain, net. In 2015, we recognized a $22.5 million non-cash net gain related to the final business combination accounting for the White Oak Acquisition. For more information on the White Oak Acquisition, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 3. Acquisitions.\"\nTransportation revenues and expenses. Transportation revenues and expenses were $33.6 million and $26.0 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase of $7.6 million was primarily attributable to increased tonnage for which we arrange transportation at certain mines, partially offset by a decrease in average transportation rates in 2015. The cost of transportation services are passed through to our customers. Consequently, we do not realize any gain or loss on transportation revenues.\nSegment Information. Our 2015 Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 7.0% to $814.7 million from 2014 Segment Adjusted EBITDA of $876.2 million.

Expenses.\"\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIllinois Basin - Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased slightly by 0.1% to $617.1 million in 2015 from $616.7 million in 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to increased surface facility services and coal royalty revenues received from White Oak prior to the White Oak Acquisition as well as decreased expenses per ton resulting from a favorable production mix, partially offset by lower coal sales, which decreased 2.4% to $1.57 billion in 2015 from $1.61 billion in 2014, and higher equity in loss of affiliates from White Oak prior to the White Oak Acquisition as discussed above. The decrease of $38.1 million in coal sales primarily reflects lower average coal sales prices of $51.01 in 2015 compared to $52.67 in 2014 resulting from current market conditions discussed above and the assumption of lower-priced legacy\ncontracts inherited in the White Oak Acquisition, partially offset by increased tons sold, which increased 0.8% to 30.8 million tons in 2015 compared to 30.5 million tons in 2014. Higher coal sales volumes resulted from our Gibson South mine and the assumption of operations at the Hamilton mine, partially offset by lower recoveries and shift reductions at our River View, Warrior and Gibson North mines, shift reductions at our Onton mine, as well as the shutdown of operations at our Gibson North and Onton mines in the fourth quarter of 2015, all in response to weak coal demand. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense decreased 5.1% to $949.3 million in 2015 from $1.00 billion in 2014 and decreased $1.92 per ton sold to $30.82 from $32.74 per ton sold in 2014, primarily due to the favorable production mix in 2015, partially offset by insurance proceeds received in 2014 related to the Onton mine discussed above, as well as the impact of certain other cost increases and decreases described above under \"-Operating expenses and outside coal purchases.\"\nAppalachia - Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $183.9 million for 2015 as compared to $254.0 million for 2014. The decrease of $70.1 million was primarily attributable to lower average coal sales prices as a result of market conditions, lower production recoveries across the region and decreased payments in lieu of shipments received from a customer related to a Tunnel Ridge coal supply agreement. Coal sales decreased 4.3% to $573.5 million in 2015 compared to $599.3 million in 2014. The decrease of $25.8 million was primarily attributable to lower average coal sales prices of $60.75 per ton sold during 2015 compared to $65.26 per ton sold in 2014 reflecting the impact of market conditions on sales from our Tunnel Ridge and MC Mining mines, partially offset by increased tons sold, which increased 2.8% to 9.4 million tons in 2015 compared to 9.2 million tons sold in 2014 as a result of increased sales volumes at our Tunnel Ridge and Mettiki mines. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense increased 9.9% to $400.7 million in 2015 from $364.7 million in 2014 and increased $2.73 per ton sold to $42.45 from $39.72 per ton sold in 2014, primarily due to lower recoveries and reduced production at our Tunnel Ridge mine as a result of lower coal demand and the need to manage coal inventories, partially offset by the benefit of fewer longwall move days in 2015, as well as the impact of certain other cost increases and decreases discussed above under \"-Operating expenses and outside coal purchases.\"\nOther and Corporate - Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $17.6 million to $26.2 million in 2015 from $8.6 million in 2014 and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense increased to $153.7 million for 2015 from $25.5 million in 2014. These increases were primarily as a result of increased Mt. Vernon transloading services and intercompany related activity such as increased coal brokerage activity, MAC sales and revenues and expenses of AROP Funding and Wildcat Insurance, which are eliminated upon consolidation. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense also increased in 2015 due to the absence of the benefit of a gain of $4.4 million recognized in 2014 on the sale of Pontiki's assets.\nElimination - Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense and coal sales eliminations significantly increased in 2015 to $127.2 million and $120.0 million, respectively, reflecting additional intercompany coal sales to Alliance Coal to support increased coal brokerage activity resulting from coal supply agreements acquired from Patriot Coal Corporation (\"Patriot\") on December 31, 2014. For more information on the Patriot acquisition, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 3. Acquisitions.\"\nReconciliation of non-GAAP \"Segment Adjusted EBITDA\" to GAAP \"net income\" and reconciliation of non-GAAP \"Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense\" to GAAP \"Operating Expenses\"\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) is defined as net income (prior to the allocation of noncontrolling interest) before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, asset impairment, acquisition gain, net and general and administrative expenses. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is a key component of consolidated EBITDA, which is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others. We believe that the presentation of EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our performance and results of operations because EBITDA, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, (i) provides additional information about our core operating performance and ability to generate and distribute cash flow, (ii) provides investors with the financial analytical framework upon which we base financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions and (iii) presents a measurement that investors, rating agencies and debt holders have indicated is useful in assessing us and our results of operations.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA is also used as a supplemental financial measure by our management for reasons similar to those stated in the previous explanation of EBITDA. In addition, the exclusion of corporate general and administrative expenses, which are discussed above under \"-Analysis of Historical Results of Operations,\" from consolidated Segment Adjusted EBITDA allows management to focus solely on the evaluation of segment operating profitability as it relates to our revenues and operating expenses, which are primarily controlled by our segments.\nThe following is a reconciliation of consolidated Segment Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most comparable GAAP financial measure:\nTable 198: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nConsolidated Segment Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n765,248 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n814,665 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n876,244 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeneral and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(72,529) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(67,484) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(72,552) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(322,509) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(333,713) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(274,566) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAsset impairment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(100,130) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(30,659) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(29,694) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(31,913) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAcquisition gain, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n22,548 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(13) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(21) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n339,538 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n306,171 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n497,213 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA Expense (a non-GAAP financial measure) includes operating expenses, outside coal purchases and other income. Transportation expenses are excluded as these expenses are passed through to our customers and, consequently, we do not realize any gain or loss on transportation revenues. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense is used as a supplemental financial measure by our management to assess the operating performance of our segments. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense is a key component of Segment Adjusted EBITDA in addition to coal sales and other sales and operating revenues. The exclusion of corporate general and administrative expenses from Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense allows management to focus solely on the evaluation of segment operating performance as it primarily relates to our operating expenses.

For more information on acquisitions, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 3. Acquisitions.\"\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nWe have historically satisfied our working capital requirements and funded our capital expenditures, equity investments and debt service obligations with cash generated from operations, cash provided by the issuance of debt or equity, borrowings under credit and securitization facilities and sale-leaseback transactions. We believe that existing cash balances, future cash flows from operations, borrowings under credit facilities, sale-leaseback transactions and cash provided from the issuance of debt or equity will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and additional equity investments, debt payments, commitments and distribution payments. Nevertheless, our ability to satisfy our working capital requirements, to fund planned capital expenditures and equity investments, to service our debt obligations or to pay distributions will depend upon our future operating performance and access to and cost of financing sources, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions generally and in the coal industry\nspecifically, as well as other financial and business factors, some of which are beyond our control. Based on our recent operating results, current cash position, current unitholder distributions, anticipated future cash flows and sources of financing that we expect to have available, we do not anticipate any constraints to our liquidity at this time. However, to the extent operating cash flow or access to and cost of financing sources are materially different than expected, future liquidity may be adversely affected. Please see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\"\nWe own through our consolidated affiliate, Cavalier Minerals, an equity interest in AllDale Minerals for the purchase of oil and gas mineral interests in various geographic locations within producing basins in the continental U.S. and plan to make similar additional equity investments in the future.

Equity Investments.\"\nIn February 2017, Alliance Minerals committed to directly (rather than through Cavalier Minerals) invest $30.0 million over the next two years in AllDale III which was created for similar investment purposes as AllDale Minerals.\nOn September 22, 2011, we entered into a series of transactions with White Oak to support development of the White Oak longwall mining operation (now known as the Hamilton mine) including the purchase of preferred equity interests. On July 31, 2015 (\"White Oak Acquisition Date\"), we paid $50.0 million to acquire the remaining equity interest in White Oak and assumed control of the mine. Prior to the White Oak Acquisition Date, we had funded $422.6 million to White Oak under various agreements inclusive of the preferred equity interest purchases. In conjunction with the acquisition of White Oak, we assumed $93.5 million of debt which was extinguished in the fourth quarter of 2015 and replaced with a $100 million equipment sale-leaseback arrangement. For more information on this sale-leaseback arrangement, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies.\" In 2014 and 2015, we paid $48.0 million to Patriot and $11.6 million to CONSOL Energy, Inc. to acquire various assets, including certain mining equipment and reserves. We also paid $5.5 million in 2015 to acquire the remaining equity interest in MAC. For more information on our acquisitions, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 3. Acquisitions.\"\nCash Flows\nCash provided by operating activities was $703.5 million in 2016 compared to $716.3 million in 2015. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in net income as adjusted for non-cash items and an increase in trade receivables during 2016 compared to a decrease in 2015. These decreases in cash provided by operating activities were offset in part by additional cash flows received from a reduction in coal inventories in 2016, a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets in 2016, lower payments made on accounts payable in 2016 as compared to 2015 and an increase in payroll and related benefits accruals in 2016 compared to a decrease in 2015.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $191.8 million in 2016 compared to $355.9 million in 2015. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to lower capital expenditures for mine infrastructure and equipment at various mines and a decrease in acquisition activity in 2016, offset in part by increased equity investments in affiliates and the acquisition of customer contracts in 2016. Reduced capital expenditures for mining equipment reflects in part deployment efforts for used mining equipment acquired through acquisitions in 2015 and continued re-deployment of equipment from our recently idled or closed mines previously discussed.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $505.4 million in 2016 compared to $351.6 million in 2015. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to decreased net borrowing under the revolving credit facilities, decreased proceeds received from sale-leaseback transactions and increases in payments under the term loan and capital lease obligations all in 2016, offset in part by increased net borrowings under the securitization facility and reduced distributions paid to partners in 2016. Comparative results between the years also reflect the use of $205 million of cash in 2015 for repayment of our Series A Notes.\nWe have various commitments primarily related to long-term debt, including capital leases, operating lease commitments related to buildings and equipment, obligations for estimated future asset retirement obligations costs, workers' compensation and pneumoconiosis, capital projects and pension funding. We expect to fund these commitments with existing cash balances, future cash flows from operations and cash provided from borrowings of debt or issuance of equity.\nThe following table provides details regarding our contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2016:\nTable 200: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContractual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthan 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1-3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3-5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMore than\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nObligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nyear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n550,000 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n150,000 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n400,000 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFuture interest obligations(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n37,380 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20,656 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n16,724 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n28,267 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11,811 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15,217 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,239 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCapital leases(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n124,239 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n32,374 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n81,233 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,746 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPurchase obligations for capital projects\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n27,288 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n27,288 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReclamation obligations(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n236,442 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n235,237 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWorkers' compensation and pneumoconiosis benefit(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n251,288 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11,796 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20,586 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15,327 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n203,579 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,254,904 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n254,360 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n534,303 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n26,539 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n439,702 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 201: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nInterest on variable-rate, long-term debt was calculated using rates elected by us at December 31, 2016, adjusted for the estimated increase of 95 basis points under the Credit Agreement, for the remaining term of outstanding borrowings.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncludes amounts classified as interest and maintenance cost.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 203: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFuture commitments for reclamation obligations, workers' compensation and pneumoconiosis are shown at undiscounted amounts.

These arrangements include coal reserve leases, indemnifications, transportation obligations and financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, such as bank letters of credit and surety bonds. Liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, and we do not expect these off-balance sheet arrangements to have any material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe use a combination of surety bonds and letters of credit to secure our financial obligations for reclamation, workers' compensation and other obligations as follows as of December 31, 2016:\nTable 204: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWorkers'\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nReclamation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCompensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nObligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nObligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSurety bonds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n171.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n84.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n13.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n269.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLetters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures decreased to $91.1 million in 2016 compared to $212.8 million in 2015. See our discussion of \"Cash Flows\" above concerning this decrease in capital expenditures.\nWe currently project average estimated annual maintenance capital expenditures over the next five years of approximately $4.25 per ton produced. Our anticipated total capital expenditures, including maintenance capital expenditures, for 2017 are estimated in a range of $145.0 to $165.0 million. Management anticipates funding 2017 capital requirements with our December 31, 2016 cash and cash equivalents of $39.8 million, future cash flows from operations, borrowings under revolving credit and securitization facilities and cash provided from the issuance of debt or equity. We will continue to have significant capital requirements over the long term, which may require us to incur debt or seek additional equity capital. The availability and cost of additional capital will depend upon prevailing market conditions, the\nmarket price of our common units and several other factors over which we have limited control, as well as our financial condition and results of operations.\nInsurance\nEffective October 1, 2016, we renewed our annual property and casualty insurance program. Our property insurance was procured from our wholly owned captive insurance company, Wildcat Insurance. Wildcat Insurance charged certain of our subsidiaries for the premiums on this program and in return purchased reinsurance for the program in the standard market. The maximum limit in the commercial property program is $100.0 million per occurrence, excluding a $1.5 million deductible for property damage, a 75, 90 or 120 day waiting period for underground business interruption depending on the mining complex and an additional $10.0 million overall aggregate deductible. We can make no assurances that we will not experience significant insurance claims in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to purchase property insurance in the future.\nDebt Obligations\nCredit Facility and Senior Notes\nCredit Facility. On January 27, 2017, our Intermediate Partnership entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\") with various financial institutions for a revolving credit facility and term loan (the \"Credit Facility\"). The Credit Facility replaces the $250 million term loan (\"Replaced Term Loan\") and $700 million revolving credit facility (\"Replaced Revolving Credit Facility\") extended to the Intermediate Partnership on May 23, 2012 (the \"Replaced Credit Agreement\") by various banks and other lenders that would have expired on May 23, 2017. Certain lenders under the Replaced Credit Agreement, referred to as the non-extending lenders (\"Non-Extending Lenders\") are only participating in the Credit Facility through May 23, 2017, whereas the remaining lenders under the Replaced Credit Agreement are referred to as the extending lenders (\"Extending Lenders\").\nThe Credit Agreement provides for a $776.5 million revolving credit facility, reducing to $479.75 million on May 23, 2017, including a sublimit of $125 million for the issuance of letters of credit and a sublimit of $15.0 million for swingline borrowings (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\"), and for a term loan with a remaining principal balance of $50.0 million (the \"Term Loan\"). The outstanding revolver balance of $255.0 million and term loan balance of $50.0 million under the Replaced Credit Agreement were deemed to have been advanced under the Credit Facility on January 27, 2017. The Credit Agreement is guaranteed by all of the material direct and indirect subsidiaries of our Intermediate Partnership, and is secured by substantially all of the Intermediate Partnership's assets. The $776.5 million Revolving Credit Facility through May 23, 2017 includes the commitments of the Non-Extending Lenders originally made under the Replaced Credit Agreement, as well as, the commitments of the new lenders and Extending Lenders. The new lenders and Extending Lenders under the new Revolving Credit Facility are providing $479.75 million of the $776.5 million total.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility terminates on May 23, 2019, at which time all amounts outstanding are required to be repaid. The Revolving Credit Facility termination date will accelerate to (a) May 23, 2017 if, on or before May 13, 2017, the Intermediate Partnership has not satisfied the Cavalier Condition (as defined in the Credit Agreement) or (b) March 27, 2018 if, on or before March 27, 2018, the Intermediate Partnership has not satisfied the Senior Notes Condition (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The Cavalier Condition requires by May 13, 2017 that we utilize the Cavalier Credit Facility which is described below, to prepay $96.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Senior Notes Condition requires that we either (a) replace the Series B senior notes (\"Series B Senior Notes,\" as described below) with junior financing that matures no earlier than January 2020, or (b) repay the Series B Senior Notes or escrow funds sufficient to repay them, in either case (a) or (b), at least 90 days prior to their expiration on June 26, 2018. We believe that both the Cavalier Condition and the Senior Note Condition will be fulfilled. The Term Loan will terminate on May 23, 2017 at which time the aggregate remaining outstanding principle balance of $50.0 million and unpaid interest will be paid in full.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the option of the Intermediate Partnership, at either (i) the Base Rate at the greater of three benchmarks, or (ii) a Eurodollar Rate, plus applicable margins for (i) and (ii) that fluctuates depending upon the ratio of Consolidated Debt to Consolidated Cash Flow (each as defined in the Credit Agreement). The Revolving Credit Facility bears a lower interest rate (\"Lower Rate\") for Non-Extending Lenders during their brief participation period which ends May 23, 2017 compared to rates associated with the new lenders and Extending Lenders which are in effect through May 23, 2019. The Lower Rate, which also applies to all lenders for the Term Loan, remains unchanged from prior interest rates under the Replaced Credit Agreement. Interest is payable quarterly. The Credit\nAgreement also provides for the payment of certain fees, including an unused portion fee and a fee with respect to the available amount under outstanding letters of credit. As with the Replaced Credit Agreement borrowings, we will utilize the Revolving Credit Facility, as appropriate, for working capital requirements, capital expenditures and investments in affiliates, scheduled debt payments and distribution payments. We incurred debt issuance costs of approximately $6.7 million, mostly in 2017, in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility which will be deferred and amortized as a component of interest expense over the duration of the Revolving Credit Facility.\nBorrowings under the Replaced Credit Agreement bore interest at a Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate, at our election, plus an applicable margin that fluctuated depending upon the ratio of Consolidated Debt to Consolidated Cash Flow (each as defined in the Replaced Credit Agreement). We elected a Eurodollar Rate, which, with applicable margin, was 2.42% on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2016. In June 2014, we began making quarterly principal payments on the Replaced Term Loan, leaving a balance of $50.0 million at December 31, 2016. We had borrowings of $255.0 million and $5.6 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Replaced Revolving Credit Facility at December 31, 2016. We incurred an annual commitment fee of 0.25% on the undrawn portion of the Replaced Revolving Credit Facility.\nSeries B Senior Notes. On January 27, 2017, the Intermediate Partnership amended the 2008 Note Purchase Agreement dated June 26, 2008, for $145.0 million of Series B Senior Notes which bear interest at 6.72% and mature on June 26, 2018 with interest payable semi-annually. The amendment provides for certain modifications to the terms and provisions of the Note Purchase Agreement, including granting liens on substantially all of the Intermediate Partnership's assets to secure its obligations under the Note Purchase Agreement on an equal basis with the obligations under the Credit Agreement. The amendment also modifies certain covenants to align them with the same covenants in the Credit Agreement. The Series B Senior Notes are the subject of the Senior Notes Condition of the Credit Agreement discussed above. The Series B Senior Notes are guaranteed by all of the material direct and indirect subsidiaries of our Intermediate Partnership.\nThe Credit Agreement and the Series B Senior Notes (collectively, \"ARLP Debt Arrangements\") contain various restrictions affecting our Intermediate Partnership and its subsidiaries including, among other things, incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens, sale of assets, investments, mergers and consolidations and transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to various exceptions, and the payment of cash distributions by our Intermediate Partnership if such payment would result in a fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the ARLP Debt Arrangements) of less than 1.25 to 1.0 for each rolling four-quarter period. See \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 10 - Variable Interest Entities\" for further discussion of restrictions on the cash available for distribution. The ARLP Debt Arrangements also require the Intermediate Partnership to remain in control of a certain amount of mineable coal reserves relative to its annual production. In addition, the ARLP Debt Arrangements, require the Intermediate Partnership maintain (a) a debt to cash flow ratio of not more than 2.25 to 1.0 and (b) a cash flow to interest expense ratio of not less than 3.0 to 1.0, in each case, during the four most recently ended fiscal quarters. The Replaced Credit Agreement and Series B Senior Notes requirements for (a) and (b) above were 3.0 to 1.0 as of December 31, 2016. ARLP's actual debt to cash flow ratio and cash flow to interest expense ratio were 0.93 to 1.0 and 23.0 to 1.0, respectively, for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2016. We were in compliance with the covenants of the Replaced Credit Agreement and the Series B Senior Notes as of December 31, 2016.\nAccounts Receivable Securitization. On December 5, 2014, certain direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of our Intermediate Partnership entered into a $100.0 million accounts receivable securitization facility (\"Securitization Facility\") providing additional liquidity and funding. Under the Securitization Facility, certain subsidiaries sell trade receivables on an ongoing basis to our Intermediate Partnership, which then sells the trade receivables to AROP Funding, a wholly-owned bankruptcy-remote special purpose subsidiary of our Intermediate Partnership, which in turn borrows on a revolving basis up to $100.0 million secured by the trade receivables. After the sale, Alliance Coal, as servicer of the assets, collects the receivables on behalf of AROP Funding. The Securitization Facility bears interest based on a Eurodollar Rate. It was renewed in December 2016 and matures in December 2017. At December 31, 2016, we had $100.0 million outstanding under the Securitization Facility.\nCavalier Credit Agreement. On October 6, 2015, Cavalier Minerals (see Note 10 - Variable Interest Entities) entered into a credit agreement (the \"Cavalier Credit Agreement\") with Mineral Lending, LLC (\"Mineral Lending\") for a $100.0 million line of credit (the \"Cavalier Credit Facility\"). Mineral Lending is an entity owned by (a) ARH II, (b) an entity owned by an officer of ARH who is also a director of ARH II (\"ARH Officer\") and (c) foundations established by the President and Chief Executive Officer of MGP and Kathleen S. Craft. There is no commitment fee under the facility. Borrowings under the Cavalier Credit Facility bear interest at a one month LIBOR rate plus 6.0% with interest payable\nquarterly. Repayment of the principal balance will begin following the first fiscal quarter after the earlier of the date on which the aggregate amount borrowed exceeds $90.0 million or December 31, 2017, in quarterly payments of an amount equal to the greater of $1.3 million initially, escalated to $2.5 million after two years, or fifty percent of Cavalier Minerals' excess cash flow. The Cavalier Credit Facility matures September 30, 2024, at which time all amounts then outstanding are required to be repaid. To secure payment of the facility, Cavalier Minerals pledged all of its partnership interests, owned or later acquired, in AllDale Minerals. Cavalier Minerals may prepay the Cavalier Credit Facility at any time in whole or in part subject to terms and conditions described in the Cavalier Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2016, Cavalier Minerals had not drawn on the Cavalier Credit Facility. Alliance Minerals has the right to require Cavalier Minerals to draw the full amount available under the Cavalier Credit Facility and distribute the proceeds to the members of Cavalier Minerals, including Alliance Minerals. The Cavalier Credit Facility is the subject of the Cavalier Condition of the Credit Agreement discussed above.\nOther. We also have agreements with two banks to provide additional letters of credit in an aggregate amount of $31.1 million to maintain surety bonds to secure certain asset retirement obligations and our obligations for workers' compensation benefits. At December 31, 2016, we had $13.0 million in letters of credit outstanding under agreements with these two banks.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We discuss these estimates and judgments with the audit committee of the MGP Board of Directors (\"Audit Committee\") periodically. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We have provided a description of all significant accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. The following critical accounting policies are materially impacted by judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\nBusiness Combinations and Goodwill\nWe account for business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. See \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 3. Acquisitions\" for more information on our acquisitions. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Given the time it takes to obtain pertinent information to finalize the acquired company's balance sheet, it may be several quarters before we are able to finalize those initial fair value estimates. Accordingly, it is not uncommon for the initial estimates to be subsequently revised. The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.\nIn the 2015 acquisitions of White Oak and MAC, we were required to value the previously held equity interests just prior to acquisition and record a gain or loss if fair value was determined to be different from our carrying value. We re-measured our equity investment immediately prior to the White Oak acquisition using a discounted cash flow model which resulted in a loss of $52.3 million. The assumptions used in the determination of the fair value include projected financial information, forward coal price curves and a risk adjusted discount rate. When valuing the previously held equity investment in MAC, a market approach was used to determine that the carrying value of the investment was equal to the fair value resulting in no gain or loss being recorded.\nAn additional part of the White Oak acquisition was valuing the pre-existing relationships that the Partnership had with White Oak. If pre-existing relationships are settled as part of a business combination the acquirer must evaluate the terms of the relationships compared to current market terms and record a gain or loss to the extent that the relationships are considered above or below market. We developed a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of each of these agreements at market rates and compared the valuations to similar models using the contractual rates of the agreements to determine our gains or losses. The assumptions used in these valuation models include processing rates, royalty rates, transportation rates, marketing rates, forward coal price curves, current interest rates, projected financial information and risk-adjusted discount rates. After completing our analysis, we recorded a $74.8 million gain as a result of net above-market terms associated with the pre-existing relationships.\nThe only indefinite-lived intangible that the Partnership has is goodwill. At December 31, 2016, the Partnership had $136.4 million in goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized, but subject to annual reviews on November 30th for impairment at a reporting unit level. The reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed or operated. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment. We have assessed the reporting unit definitions and determined that at December 31, 2016, the Hamilton reporting unit and the MAC reporting unit are the appropriate reporting units for testing goodwill impairment related to the White Oak and MAC acquisitions.\nThe Partnership computes the fair value of the reporting units primarily using the income approach (discounted cash flow analysis). The computations require management to make significant estimates. Critical estimates are used as part of these evaluations include, among other things, the discount rate applied to future earnings reflecting a weighted average cost of capital rate, and projected coal price assumptions. Our estimate of the coal forward sales price curve and future sales volumes are critical assumptions used in our discounted cash flow analysis. In future periods, it is reasonably possible that a variety of circumstances could result in an impairment of our goodwill.\nA discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about sales, operating margins, capital expenditures, working capital and coal sales prices. Assumptions about sales, operating margins, capital expenditures and coal sales prices are based on our budgets, business plans, economic projections, and anticipated future cash flows. In determining the fair value of our reporting units, we were required to make significant judgments and estimates regarding the impact of anticipated economic factors on our business. The forecast assumptions used in the period ended December 31, 2016 make certain assumptions about future pricing, volumes and expected maintenance capital expenditures. Assumptions are also made for a \"normalized\" perpetual growth rate for periods beyond the long range financial forecast period.\nOur estimates of fair value are sensitive to changes in all of these variables, certain of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside our control. As a result, actual performance in the near and longer-term could be different from these expectations and assumptions. This could be caused by events such as strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions and the impact of economic factors, such as over production in coal and low prices of natural gas. In addition, some of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value of the reporting units are outside the control of management, including interest rates, cost of capital and our credit ratings. While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting units and other intangible assets, it is possible a material change could occur.\nCoal Reserve Values\nAll of the reserves presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitute proven and probable reserves. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of reserves, including many factors beyond our control. Estimates of coal reserves necessarily depend upon a number of variables and assumptions, any one of which may vary considerably from actual results. These factors and assumptions relate to:\nTable 205: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ngeological and mining conditions, which may not be fully identified by available exploration data and/or differ from our experiences in areas where we currently mine;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 206: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe percentage of coal in the ground ultimately recoverable;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 207: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nhistorical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 208: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe assumed effects of regulation and taxes by governmental agencies; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 209: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nassumptions concerning future coal prices, operating costs, capital expenditures, severance and excise taxes and development and reclamation costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor these reasons, estimates of the recoverable quantities of coal attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows expected from these properties as prepared by different engineers, or by the same engineers at different times, may vary substantially. Actual production, revenue and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates, and these variations may be material. Certain account classifications within our financial statements such as depreciation, depletion, and amortization, impairment charges and certain liability calculations such as asset retirement obligations may depend upon estimates of coal reserve quantities and values. Accordingly, when actual coal reserve quantities and values vary significantly from estimates, certain accounting estimates and amounts within our consolidated financial statements may be materially\nimpacted. Coal reserve values are reviewed annually, at a minimum, for consideration in our consolidated financial statements.\nWorkers' Compensation and Pneumoconiosis (Black Lung) Benefits\nWe provide income replacement and medical treatment for work-related traumatic injury claims as required by applicable state laws. We generally provide for these claims through self-insurance programs. Workers' compensation laws also compensate survivors of workers who suffer employment related deaths. Our liability for traumatic injury claims is the estimated present value of current workers' compensation benefits, based on our actuary estimates. Our actuarial calculations are based on a blend of actuarial projection methods and numerous assumptions including claim development patterns, mortality, medical costs and interest rates. See \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 17. Accrued Workers' Compensation and Pneumoconiosis Benefits\" for additional discussion. We had accrued liabilities for workers' compensation of $48.1 million and $54.6 million for these costs at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. A one-percentage-point reduction in the discount rate would have increased the liability and operating expense by approximately $3.7 million at December 31, 2016.\nCoal mining companies are subject to CMHSA, as amended, and various state statutes for the payment of medical and disability benefits to eligible recipients related to coal worker's pneumoconiosis, or black lung. We provide for these claims through self-insurance programs. Our black lung benefits liability is calculated using the service cost method based on the actuarial present value of the estimated black lung obligation. Our actuarial calculations are based on numerous assumptions including disability incidence, medical costs, mortality, death benefits, dependents and discount rates. We had accrued liabilities of $65.0 million and $61.7 million for the black lung benefits at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. A one-percentage-point reduction in the discount rate would have increased the expense recognized for the year ended December 31, 2016 by approximately $4.1 million. Under the service cost method used to estimate our black lung benefits liability, actuarial gains or losses attributable to changes in actuarial assumptions, such as the discount rate, are amortized over the remaining service period of active miners.\nThe discount rate for workers' compensation and black lung is derived by applying the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve to the projected liability payout. Other assumptions, such as claim development patterns, mortality, disability incidence and medical costs, are based upon standard actuarial tables adjusted for our actual historical experiences whenever possible. We review all actuarial assumptions periodically for reasonableness and consistency and update such factors when underlying assumptions, such as discount rates, change or when sustained changes in our historical experiences indicate a shift in our trend assumptions are warranted.\nDefined Benefit Plan\nEligible employees at certain of our mining operations participate in the Alliance Coal, LLC and Affiliates Pension Plan for Coal Employees (the \"Pension Plan\") that we sponsor. The Pension Plan is closed to new participants and effective January 31, 2017 participants within the Pension Plan (\"Participants\") are no longer receiving benefit accruals for service. All Participants can participate in enhanced benefits provisions under the PSSP. The benefit formula for the Pension Plan is a fixed dollar unit based on years of service. The funded status of our pension benefit plan is recognized separately in our consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability. The funded status is the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the plan's benefit obligation. Unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and unrecognized prior service costs and credits are deferred and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until amortized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. Unrecognized actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets are amortized over the participants' average remaining future years of service. The calculation of our net periodic benefit cost (pension expense) and benefit obligation (pension liability) associated with our Pension Plan requires the use of a number of assumptions including expected return on assets, discount rates, mortality assumptions, employee turnover rates and retirement dates. Changes in these assumptions can result in materially different pension expense and pension liability amounts. In addition, actual experiences can differ materially from the assumptions. Significant assumptions used in calculating pension expense and pension liability are shown in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 13. Employee Benefit Plans\" and as follows:\nTable 210: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOur expected long-term rate of return assumption is based on broad equity and bond indices, the investment goals and objectives, the target investment allocation and on the average annual total return for each asset class.

Additionally, we base our determination of pension expense on a smoothed market-related valuation of assets equal to the fair value of assets, which immediately recognizes all investment gains or losses. The actual return on plan assets was 5.9% and (2.0)% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return assumption by 1.0% (from 7.5% to 6.5%) at December 31, 2015 would have increased our pension expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 by approximately $0.7 million; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 214: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOur weighted-average discount rate used to determine our pension liability was 4.06% and 4.27% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

The discount rate that we utilize for determining our future pension obligation is based on a review of currently available high-quality fixed-income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency. We have historically used the average monthly yield for December of an A-rated utility bond index as the primary benchmark for establishing the discount rate. Lowering the discount rate assumption by 0.5% (from 4.27% to 3.77%) at December 31, 2015 would not have materially increased our pension expense for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLong-Lived Assets\nWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows. Long-lived assets and certain intangibles are not reviewed for impairment unless an impairment indicator is noted. Several examples of impairment indicators include:\nTable 215: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nA significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 216: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nA significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used or in its physical condition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 217: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nA significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long-lived asset, including an adverse action of assessment by a regulator;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 218: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAn accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long-lived asset;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 219: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nA current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset; or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 220: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nA current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. The term more likely that not refers to a level of likelihood that is more than 50 percent.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe above factors are not all inclusive, and management must continually evaluate whether other factors are present that would indicate a long-lived asset may be impaired. If there is an indication that carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, the asset is monitored by management where changes to significant assumptions are reviewed. Individual assets are grouped for impairment review purposes based on the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets, generally on a by-mine basis. The amount of impairment is measured by the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset. The fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on various factors, including the present values of expected future cash flows\nusing a risk adjusted discount rate, the marketability of coal properties and the estimated fair value of assets that could be sold or used at other operations. We recorded an asset impairment of $100.1 million in 2015 (see \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 4. Long-Lived Asset Impairments\"). No impairment charges were recorded in 2016.\nMine Development Costs\nMine development costs are capitalized until production, other than production incidental to the mine development process, commences and are amortized on a units of production method based on the estimated proven and probable reserves. Mine development costs represent costs incurred in establishing access to mineral reserves and include costs associated with sinking or driving shafts and underground drifts, permanent excavations, roads and tunnels. The end of the development phase and the beginning of the production phase takes place when construction of the mine for economic extraction is substantially complete. Our estimate of when construction of the mine for economic extraction is substantially complete is based upon a number of factors, such as expectations regarding the economic recoverability of reserves, the type of mine under development, and completion of certain mine requirements, such as ventilation. Coal extracted during the development phase is incidental to the mine's production capacity and is not considered to shift the mine into the production phase. At December 31, 2016, there were no capitalized development costs associated with mines in the development phase. All past capitalized development costs are associated with mines that shifted to the production phase and thus, these costs are being amortized. We believe that the carrying value of the past development costs will be recovered. At December 31, 2015, capitalized mine development costs representing the carrying value of development costs attributable to properties where we had not reached the production stage of mining operations totaled $5.9 million.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nSMCRA and similar state statutes require that mined property be restored in accordance with specified standards and an approved reclamation plan. A liability is recorded for the estimated cost of future mine asset retirement and closing procedures on a present value basis when incurred or acquired and a corresponding amount is capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Those costs relate to permanently sealing portals at underground mines and to reclaiming the final pits and support surface acreage for both our underground mines and past surface mines. Examples of these types of costs, common to both types of mining, include, but are not limited to, removing or covering refuse piles and settling ponds, water treatment obligations, and dismantling preparation plants, other facilities and roadway infrastructure. Accrued liabilities of $125.7 million and $123.7 million for these costs are recorded at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 16. Asset Retirement Obligations\" for additional information. The liability for asset retirement and closing procedures is sensitive to changes in cost estimates and estimated mine lives. As changes in estimates occur (such as mine plan revisions, changes in estimated costs or changes in timing of the performance of reclamation activities), the revisions to the obligation and asset are recognized at the appropriate credit-adjusted, risk-free interest rate.\nAccounting for asset retirement obligations also requires depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost and accretion of the asset retirement obligation over time. Depreciation is generally determined on a units-of-production basis and accretion is generally recognized over the life of the producing assets.\nOn at least an annual basis, we review our entire asset retirement obligation liability and make necessary adjustments for permit changes approved by state authorities, changes in the timing of reclamation activities, and revisions to cost estimates and productivity assumptions, to reflect current experience. Adjustments to the liability associated with these assumptions resulted in a decrease of $1.4 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. The adjustments to the liability for the year ended December 31, 2016 were primarily attributable to the net impact of overall general changes in inflation and discount rates, current estimates of the costs and scope of remaining reclamation work, reclamation work completed and fluctuations in projected mine life estimates, offset in part by increased expansion and disturbances of refuse sites primarily at our Warrior and Gibson County Coal mines.\nWhile the precise amount of these future costs cannot be determined with certainty, we have estimated the costs and timing of future asset retirement obligations escalated for inflation, then discounted and recorded at the present value of those estimates. Discounting resulted in reducing the accrual for asset retirement obligations by $110.7 million and $104.8 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015. We estimate that the aggregate undiscounted cost of final mine closure is approximately $236.4 million at December 31, 2016. If our assumptions differ from actual experiences, or if changes in\nthe regulatory environment occur, our actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated.\nContingencies\nWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings. Our estimates of the probable costs and probability of resolution of these claims are based upon a number of assumptions, which we have developed in consultation with legal counsel involved in the defense of these matters and based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Based on known facts and circumstances, we believe the ultimate outcome of these outstanding lawsuits, claims and regulatory proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, if the results of these matters were different from management's current opinion and in amounts greater than our accruals, then they could have a material adverse effect.\nUniversal Shelf\nIn February 2015, we filed with the SEC a universal shelf registration statement allowing us to issue from time to time an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities (\"2015 Registration Statement\"). At February 24, 2017, we had not utilized any amounts available under the 2015 Registration Statement.\nRelated-Party Transactions\nThe Board of Directors and the conflicts committee of the MGP Board of Directors (\"Conflicts Committee\") review our related-party transactions that involve a potential conflict of interest between a general partner and ARLP or its subsidiaries or another partner to determine that such transactions are fair and reasonable to ARLP. As a result of these reviews, the Board of Directors and the Conflicts Committee approved our related-party transactions described in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 18. Related-Party Transactions\" that had such potential conflict of interest as fair and reasonable to ARLP.\nAccruals of Other Liabilities\nWe had accruals for other liabilities, including current obligations, totaling $270.8 million and $279.2 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These accruals were chiefly comprised of workers' compensation benefits, black lung benefits, and costs associated with asset retirement obligations. These obligations are self-insured except for certain excess insurance coverage for workers' compensation. The accruals of these items were based on estimates of future expenditures based on current legislation, related regulations and other developments. Thus, from time to time, our results of operations may be significantly affected by changes to these liabilities. Please see \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 16. Asset Retirement Obligations\" and \"Note 17. Accrued Workers' Compensation and Pneumoconiosis Benefits.\"\nInflation\nAny future inflationary or deflationary pressures could adversely affect the results of our operations. For example, at times our results have been significantly impacted by price increases affecting many of the components of our operating expenses such as fuel, steel, maintenance expense and labor. Please see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\"\nNew Accounting Standards\nSee \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 2.

discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following financial information, please see \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 1. Organization and Presentation and Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\"\nExecutive Overview\nWe are a diversified producer and marketer of coal primarily to major U.S. utilities and industrial users and were the first such producer and marketer in the nation to be a publicly traded master limited partnership. We are currently the second-largest coal producer in the eastern U.S. In 2016, we produced and sold 35.2 million and 36.7 million tons of coal, respectively. The coal we produced in 2016 was approximately 15.2% low-sulfur coal, 63.8% medium-sulfur coal and 21.0% high-sulfur coal. Based on market expectations, we classify low-sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of less than 1.5%, medium-sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of 1.5% to 3%, and high-sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of greater than 3%. The BTU content of our coal ranges from 11,400 to 13,200.\nWe operate eight underground mining complexes, including the Hamilton longwall mining complex in southern Illinois which we acquired on July 31, 2015 by purchasing the remaining equity ownership in White Oak and operate a coal-loading terminal on the Ohio River at Mt. Vernon, Indiana. Prior to July 31, 2015, we owned a non-controlling, preferred equity interest in White Oak, leased coal reserves to White Oak and owned and operated certain surface facilities at White Oak's mining complex. We also own the idled Onton mine and idled Gibson North mine. In addition, we own through our consolidated affiliate, Cavalier Minerals, an equity interest in AllDale Minerals for the purchase of oil and gas mineral interests in various geographic locations within producing basins in the continental U.S. and plan to make similar additional equity investments. At December 31, 2016, we had approximately 1.76 billion tons of proven and probable coal reserves in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. We believe we control adequate reserves to implement our currently contemplated mining plans. Please see \"Item 1. Business-Mining Operations\" for further discussion of our mines.\nIn 2016, approximately 90.3% of our sales tonnage was purchased by electric utilities, with the balance sold to third-party resellers and industrial consumers. Although many utility customers recently have appeared to favor a shorter-term contracting strategy, in 2016, approximately 87.7% of our sales tonnage was sold under long-term contracts. Our long-term contracts contribute to our stability and profitability by providing greater predictability of sales volumes and sales prices. In 2016, approximately 93.0% of our medium- and high-sulfur coal was sold to utility plants with installed pollution control devices. These devices, also known as scrubbers, eliminate substantially all emissions of sulfur dioxide.\nAs discussed in more detail in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors,\" our results of operations could be impacted by prices for items that are used in coal production such as steel, electricity and other supplies, unforeseen geologic conditions or mining and processing equipment failures and unexpected maintenance problems, and by the availability or reliability of transportation for coal shipments. Additionally, our results of operations could be impacted by our ability to obtain and renew permits necessary for our operations, secure or acquire coal reserves, or find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts. Moreover, the regulatory environment has grown increasingly stringent in recent years. As outlined in \"Item 1. Business-Regulation and Laws,\" a variety of measures taken by regulatory agencies in the U.S. and abroad in response to the perceived threat from climate change attributed to GHG emissions could substantially increase compliance costs for us and our customers and reduce demand for coal, which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations. For additional information regarding some of the risks and uncertainties that affect our business and the industry in which we operate, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\"\nOur principal expenses related to the production of coal are labor and benefits, equipment, materials and supplies, maintenance, royalties and excise taxes. We employ a totally union-free workforce. Many of the benefits of our union-free workforce are related to higher productivity and are not necessarily reflected in our direct costs. In addition, transportation costs may be substantial and are often the determining factor in a coal consumer's contracting decision.\nOur mining operations are located near many of the major eastern utility generating plants and on major coal hauling railroads in the eastern U.S. Our River View and Tunnel Ridge mines and Mt. Vernon transloading facility are located on the Ohio River and our idled Onton mine is located on the Green River in western Kentucky.\nOur primary business strategy is to create sustainable, capital-efficient growth in available cash to maximize distributions to our unitholders by:\n \u00b7 expanding our operations by adding and developing mines and coal reserves in existing, adjacent or neighboring properties; \n \u00b7 extending the lives of our current mining operations through acquisition and development of coal reserves using our existing infrastructure; \n \u00b7 continuing to make productivity improvements to remain a low-cost producer in each region in which we operate; \n \u00b7 strengthening our position with existing and future customers by offering a broad range of coal qualities, transportation alternatives and customized services; \n \u00b7 developing strategic relationships to take advantage of opportunities within the coal industry and MLP sector; and \n \u00b7 making equity investments for the purchase of oil and gas mineral interests in various geographic locations within producing basins in the continental U.S. \nWe have two reportable segments: Illinois Basin and Appalachia, and an \"all other\" category referred to as Other and Corporate. Our reportable segments correspond to major coal producing regions in the eastern U.S. Factors similarly affecting financial performance of our operating segments within each of these two reportable segments generally include coal quality, geology, coal marketing opportunities, mining and transportation methods and regulatory issues.\n \u00b7 Illinois Basin reportable segment is comprised of multiple operating segments, including the following current operating mining complexes: a) Webster County Coal's Dotiki mining complex, b) Gibson County Coal's mining complex, which includes the Gibson North mine (currently idled) and Gibson South mine, c) Warrior's mining complex, d) River View's mining complex and e) the Hamilton mining complex. In April 2014, initial production began at the Gibson South mine. The Gibson North mine has been idled since the fourth quarter of 2015 in response to market conditions. \nThe Illinois Basin reportable segment also includes White County Coal's Pattiki mining complex, Hopkins County Coal's mining complex, which includes the Elk Creek mine, the Pleasant View surface mineable reserves and the Fies underground project, Sebree's mining complex, which includes the Onton mine, Steamport and certain Sebree reserves, CR Services, LLC, CR Machine Shop, LLC, certain properties and equipment of Alliance Resource Properties, ARP Sebree, LLC (\"ARP Sebree\"), ARP Sebree South, LLC, UC Coal, LLC and its subsidiaries, UC Mining, LLC, and UC Processing, LLC. The Pattiki mine ceased production in December 2016. The Elk Creek mine depleted its reserves in March 2016 and ceased production on April 1, 2016. The Sebree properties, the Pleasant View surface mineable reserves and the Fies underground project are held by us for future mine development. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we idled our Onton mine in response to market conditions. In the fourth quarter of 2014 and February 2015, Alliance Resource Properties acquired reserves that would allow increased production from our River View mine, add three new potential development projects for our organic growth strategy and may significantly extend the life of the Dotiki mine. UC Coal, LLC equipment assets acquired in 2015 continue being deployed as needed at various Illinois Basin operating mines. For information regarding the permitting process and matters that could hinder or delay the process, please read \"Item 1. Business-Regulation and Laws-Mining Permits and Approvals\". For information regarding Alliance Resource Properties' acquisition of reserves in December 2014 and February 2015 and our assumption of control at the Hamilton mine in July 2015, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 3. Acquisitions.\"\n \u00b7 Appalachia reportable segment is comprised of multiple operating segments, including the Mettiki mining complex, the Tunnel Ridge mining complex and the MC Mining mining complex. The Mettiki mining complex includes Mettiki Coal (WV)'s Mountain View mine and Mettiki Coal's preparation plant. During the fourth quarter 2015, we surrendered the Penn Ridge lease as those reserves were no longer a core part of our foreseeable development plans. Please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 4. Long-Lived Asset Impairment\" for further discussion of this surrender. \n \u00b7 Other and Corporate includes marketing and administrative expenses, Alliance Service, Inc. (\"ASI\") and its subsidiaries included in the Matrix Group, ASI's ownership of aircraft, Mt. Vernon's dock activities; coal brokerage activity, MAC's manufacturing and sales (primarily to our mines) of rock dust, certain activities of Alliance Resource Properties, throughput receivables and prior workers' compensation and pneumoconiosis liabilities from Pontiki Coal, LLC (\"Pontiki\"), which sold most of its assets in May 2014, Wildcat Insurance, which was established in September 2014 to assist the ARLP Partnership with its insurance requirements, Alliance Minerals and its affiliate, Cavalier Minerals, which holds equity investments in AllDale Minerals and AROP Funding, LLC (\"AROP Funding\"). Please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 7. Long-Term Debt\", \"-Note 10. Variable Interest Entities\" and \"-Note 11. Equity Investments\" for more information on AROP Funding, Alliance Minerals, Cavalier Minerals and AllDale Minerals. \nHow We Evaluate Our Performance\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operational measurements to analyze our performance. Primary measurements include the following: (1) raw and saleable tons produced per unit shift; (2) coal sales price per ton; (3) Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton; (4) EBITDA; and (5) Segment Adjusted EBITDA.\nRaw and Saleable Tons Produced per Unit Shift. We review raw and saleable tons produced per unit shift as part of our operational analysis to measure the productivity of our operating segments, which is significantly influenced by mining conditions and the efficiency of our preparation plants. Our discussion of mining conditions and preparation plant costs are found below under \"-Analysis of Historical Results of Operations\" and therefore provides implicit analysis of raw and saleable tons produced per unit shift.\nCoal Sales Price per Ton. We define coal sales price per ton as total coal sales divided by tons sold. We review coal sales price per ton to evaluate marketing efforts and for market demand and trend analysis.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per Ton. We define Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton (a non-GAAP financial measure) as the sum of operating expenses, outside coal purchases and other income divided by total tons sold. We review segment adjusted EBITDA expense per ton for cost trends.\nEBITDA. We define EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) as net income (prior to the allocation of noncontrolling interest) before net interest expense, income taxes and depreciation, depletion and amortization. EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by our management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others. We believe that the presentation of EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our performance and results of operations because EBITDA, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, (i) provides additional information about our core operating performance and ability to generate and distribute cash flow, (ii) provides investors with the financial analytical framework upon which we base financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions and (iii) presents a measurement that investors, rating agencies and debt holders have indicated is useful in assessing us and our results of operations.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA. We define Segment Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) as net income (prior to the allocation of noncontrolling interest) before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, asset impairment, acquisition gain, net and general and administrative expenses. Management therefore is able to focus solely on the evaluation of segment operating profitability as it relates to our revenues and operating expenses, which are primarily controlled by our segments.\nAnalysis of Historical Results of Operations\n2016 Compared with 2015\nWe reported net income of $339.5 million for 2016 compared to $306.2 million for 2015, an increase of $33.3 million. Comparative results between the years reflect in part the negative net impact in 2015 of $77.6 million of certain large non-cash items ( Non-Cash Items\u201d) described below and $48.5 million of equity in loss of affiliates related to White Oak also in 2015. Net income in 2016 was negatively impacted by reduced revenues compared to 2015 resulting from planned reductions in coal sales and production volumes, lower coal sales prices, lower other sales and operating revenues due to the absence of coal royalty and surface facilities revenues from White Oak in 2016, offset in part by reduced operating expenses in 2016. Lower operating expenses during 2016 primarily reflect decreased sales volumes and a favorable production cost mix resulting from our initiative to shift production to lower-cost per ton operations. Lower volumes in\n2016 resulted from idling our Onton and Gibson North mines in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the planned depletion of reserves at our Elk Creek mine in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by additional volumes from our Tunnel Ridge and Gibson South operations and the Hamilton mine acquired in the White Oak Acquisition. The Non-Cash Items in 2015 included asset impairments of $100.1 million offset in part by a net gain of $22.5 million related to final business combination accounting for the White Oak Acquisition. For more information on the White Oak Acquisition, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 3. Acquisitions.\" For more information on the 2015 non-cash asset impairments, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 4. Long-Lived Asset Impairments.\"\n\nCoal sales. Coal sales decreased $296.2 million or 13.7% to $1.86 billion for 2016 from $2.16 billion for 2015. The decrease was attributable to a volume variance of $191.2 million resulting from reduced tons sold as discussed above and a price variance of $105.0 million due to lower average coal sales prices. Average coal sales prices decreased $2.86 per ton sold in 2016 to $50.76 compared to $53.62 per ton sold in 2015, primarily due to lower-priced legacy contracts at our Hamilton mine inherited in the White Oak Acquisition and lower average prices at certain mines, particularly at our Gibson South, Dotiki, Tunnel Ridge and MC Mining operations, as a result of challenging market conditions.\nOperating expenses and outside coal purchases. Operating expenses and outside coal purchases decreased 17.2% to $1.14 billion for 2016 from $1.38 billion for 2015 primarily as a result of the previously discussed reductions to coal production volumes and a favorable production cost mix. On a per ton basis, operating expenses and outside coal purchases decreased 9.1% to $31.09 per ton sold from $34.22 per ton sold in 2015, due primarily to the lower-cost production mix and higher productivity from our Tunnel Ridge and Gibson South mines. Operating expenses were impacted by various other factors, the most significant of which are discussed below:\n \u00b7 Labor and benefit expenses per ton produced, excluding workers' compensation, decreased 7.8% to $10.65 per ton in 2016 from $11.55 per ton in 2015. This decrease of $0.90 per ton was primarily attributable to the increased mix of lower-cost production discussed above and reduced overtime in response to market conditions; \n \u00b7 Material and supplies expenses per ton produced decreased 14.8% to $9.58 per ton in 2016 from $11.25 per ton in 2015. The decrease of $1.67 per ton produced resulted primarily from the increased mix of lower-cost production discussed above and related decreases of $0.77 per ton for roof support, $0.47 per ton for contract labor used in the mining process and $0.24 per ton for certain ventilation expenses partially offset by increases of $0.22 per ton for equipment rentals primarily due to equipment leases assumed in the White Oak Acquisition and $0.15 per ton for environmental and reclamation expenses; \n \u00b7 Maintenance expenses per ton produced decreased 21.1% to $3.10 per ton in 2016 from $3.93 per ton in 2015. The decrease of $0.83 per ton produced was primarily due to production variances at certain mines discussed above; and \n \u00b7 Production taxes and royalties expenses incurred as a percentage of coal sales prices and volumes decreased $0.39 per produced ton sold in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily as a result of lower excise taxes per ton resulting from a favorable state production mix and lower average coal sales prices discussed above; \nOperating expenses and outside coal purchases per ton decreases discussed above were partially offset by the following increase:\n \u00b7 Operating expenses were increased by a 1.4 million ton inventory reduction and related inventory cost adjustments in 2016 as compared to a 1.0 million ton inventory increase and related inventory cost adjustments in 2015. \nOther sales and operating revenues. Other sales and operating revenues were principally comprised of Mt. Vernon transloading revenues, Matrix Design sales, other outside services and administrative services revenue from affiliates and, in 2015, surface facility services and coal royalty revenues received from White Oak prior to the White Oak Acquisition in July 2015. Other sales and operating revenues decreased to $39.6 million in 2016 from $82.1 million in 2015. The decrease of $42.5 million was primarily due to the absence of coal royalty and surface facilities revenues from White Oak in 2016.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses for 2016 increased to $72.5 million compared to $67.5 million in 2015. The increase of $5.0 million was primarily due to higher incentive compensation expenses.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense (\"DD&A\") for 2016 decreased to $322.5 million compared to $333.7 million in 2015. The decrease of $11.2 million was primarily due to previously discussed volume reductions at our Onton, Gibson North and Elk Creek mines, partially offset by increases in DD&A associated with the acquisition of the Hamilton mine in July 2015 and at our Pattiki mine, which ceased production in December 2016.\nAsset impairment. In 2015, we recorded $100.1 million of impairment charges comprised of a $66.9 million impairment related to the idling of our Onton mine, a $19.5 million impairment at the MC Mining complex, primarily due to lower coal sales prices, and a $13.7 million impairment due to the surrender in 2015 of leases of undeveloped coal reserves and related property. No asset impairments were recorded in 2016.\nInterest expense. Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, decreased slightly to $30.7 million in 2016 from $31.2 million in 2015 primarily due to the repayment of our Series A senior notes in June 2015 offset in part by additional interest incurred under capital lease obligations. Interest payable under our senior notes, term loan, revolving credit facility and capital lease financings is discussed below under \"-Debt Obligations.\"\nEquity in income (loss) of affiliates. Equity in income (loss) of affiliates for 2016 includes Cavalier Minerals' equity investments in AllDale Minerals. In addition to AllDale Minerals, 2015 also includes our equity investment in White Oak. For 2016, we recognized equity in income of affiliates of $3.5 million compared to equity in loss of affiliates of $49.0 million for 2015. As discussed above, as a result of the White Oak Acquisition in July 2015, we no longer account for the Hamilton mine financial results as an equity investment in our consolidated financials, but now consolidate Hamilton in our financial results. Thus, the change in equity in earnings of affiliates was primarily due to the elimination of equity losses related to White Oak as well as an increase in equity earnings from AllDale Minerals.\nAcquisition gain, net. In 2015, we recognized a $22.5 million non-cash net gain related to the final business combination accounting for the White Oak Acquisition. For more information on the White Oak Acquisition, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 3. Acquisitions.\"\nTransportation revenues and expenses. Transportation revenues and expenses were $30.1 million and $33.6 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease of $3.5 million was primarily attributable to a decrease in average transportation rates in 2016, partially offset by increased tonnage for which we arrange transportation at certain mines. The cost of transportation services are passed through to our customers. Consequently, we do not realize any gain or loss on transportation revenues.\nSegment Information. Our 2016 Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 6.1% to $765.2 million from 2015 Segment Adjusted EBITDA of $814.7 million. Segment Adjusted EBITDA, tons sold, coal sales, other sales and operating revenues and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense by segment are as follows:\n\n (1) For a definition of Segment Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense and related reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures, please see below under \"-Reconciliation of non-GAAP \"Segment Adjusted EBITDA\" to GAAP \"net income\" and reconciliation of non-GAAP \"Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense\" to GAAP \"Operating Expenses.\" \nIllinois Basin - Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 12.8% to $538.1 million in 2016 from $617.1 million in 2015, a decrease of $79.0 million. Segment Adjusted EBITDA in 2016 was negatively impacted by reduced revenues compared to 2015 resulting from planned reductions in coal sales and production volumes, lower coal sales prices, lower other sales and operating revenues due to the absence of coal royalty and surface facilities revenues from White Oak in 2016, offset in part by reduced operating expenses in 2016. Comparative results between the years also reflect the negative impact in 2015 of $48.5 million of equity in loss of affiliates related to White Oak prior to the White Oak Acquisition in July 2015. Coal sales decreased 16.9% to $1.31 billion compared to $1.57 billion in 2015. The coal sales decrease of $264.8 million primarily reflects the previously discussed reduction of coal sales and production volumes at our Onton, Gibson North and Elk Creek mines, partially offset by additional volumes from our Gibson South operation and the Hamilton mine acquired in the White Oak Acquisition. Also impacting 2016 were lower average coal sales prices which decreased 4.8% to $48.54\nper ton sold compared to $51.01 per ton sold in 2015 as a result of challenging market conditions and lower-priced legacy contracts at the Hamilton mine inherited in the White Oak Acquisition. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense decreased 18.3% to $775.9 million in 2016 from $949.3 million in 2015 due to reduced production and sales volumes as discussed above. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton decreased $1.99 per ton sold to $28.83 in 2016 from $30.82 per ton sold in 2015, primarily as a result of a favorable production cost mix in 2016 due to reducing production from higher-cost per ton operations and improved recoveries at our Gibson South, River View and Warrior mines, as well as certain cost decreases described above under \"-Operating expenses and outside coal purchases.\"\nAppalachia - Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 4.2% to $191.7 million for 2016 from $183.9 million in 2015. The increase of $7.8 million was primarily attributable to increased tons sold and reduced operating expenses partially offset by lower average coal sales prices of $54.94 per ton sold during 2016 compared to $60.76 per ton sold in 2015. Coal sales decreased 6.7% to $534.8 million in 2016 compared to $573.5 million in 2015. The decrease of $38.7 million was primarily due to lower average coal sales prices at our MC Mining and Tunnel Ridge mines. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense decreased 13.5% to $346.5 million in 2016 from $400.7 million in 2015 and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton decreased $6.85 per ton sold to $35.60 compared to $42.45 per ton sold in 2015, primarily due to a favorable production cost mix resulting from an additional 1.0 million tons being produced from Tunnel Ridge in 2016 compared to 2015 and a reduction in volumes from our higher cost Appalachia mines. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton also benefited from fewer longwall move days and lower roof support expenses, lower selling expenses across the region, and certain other cost decreases described above under \"-Operating expenses and outside coal purchases.\"\nOther and Corporate - In 2016, Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $20.2 million compared to 2015 primarily as a result of increased margins on both safety equipment sales by Matrix Design and coal brokerage sales, as well as an increase in equity earnings from AllDale Minerals and a reduction in workers' compensation and pneumoconiosis accruals related to Pontiki which sold most of its assets in May 2014. In 2016, coal sales decreased $47.3 million and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense decreased $64.1 million compared to 2015. These decreases primarily resulted from reduced intercompany coal brokerage activity.\nElimination - Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense eliminations decreased in 2016 to $72.3 million from $127.2 million in 2015 and coal sales eliminations decreased to $65.4 million from $120.0 million, respectively, primarily reflecting reduced intercompany coal brokerage activity.\n2015 Compared with 2014\nWe reported net income of $306.2 million for 2015 compared to $497.2 million for 2014. The decrease of $191.0 million was principally due to non-cash asset impairments of $100.1 million, lower average coal sales prices particularly at our Appalachian segment mines, increased depreciation, depletion and amortization and higher equity in loss of affiliates, partially offset by record coal sales volumes, increased coal volumes at lower cost per ton operations, a net gain of $22.5 million related to the final business combination accounting for the White Oak Acquisition and increased other sales and operating revenues primarily reflecting higher surface facility services and coal royalties from White Oak prior to the White Oak Acquisition. For more information on the White Oak Acquisition, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 3. Acquisitions.\" For more information on the non-cash asset impairments, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 4. Long-Lived Asset Impairments.\"\n\nCoal sales. Coal sales decreased 2.3% to $2.16 billion for 2015 from $2.21 billion for 2014. The decrease of $50.6 million in coal sales reflected lower average coal sales prices, which reduced coal sales by $79.3 million, partially offset by the benefit of record tons sold, which contributed $28.7 million in additional coal sales. Average coal sales prices decreased by $1.97 to $53.62 per ton sold in 2015 compared to $55.59 per ton sold in 2014, primarily as a result of market conditions impacted by reduced coal demand at utilities due to low natural gas prices, regulatory pressures that caused\ncoal to gas switching or plant closures and high inventories. The decline in average sales prices was particularly noticeable for our Appalachian segment, decreasing $4.51 per ton to $60.75. In addition, average coal sales prices were impacted by lower-priced legacy contracts inherited in the White Oak Acquisition. Sales and production volumes rose to 40.2 million tons sold and 41.2 million tons produced in 2015 compared to 39.7 million tons sold and 40.7 million tons produced in 2014, primarily due to the addition of Hamilton production beginning August 1, 2015, the ramp up of coal production at our Gibson South mine following the commencement of operations in April 2014 and increased sales at our Tunnel Ridge and Mettiki mines. Volume increases were partially offset by lower sales at our Warrior, Gibson North, River View and Onton mines due to shift reductions, the shutdown of operations at our Gibson North and Onton mines in the fourth quarter of 2015 and scaled backed production at our Tunnel Ridge mine during the second half of 2015, all in response to weak coal demand, as well as an inventory build at several locations. In addition to shift reductions, reduced production from Warrior resulted from its continuing transition to a new mining area.\nOperating expenses and outside coal purchases. Operating expenses and outside coal purchases decreased 0.4% to $1.38 billion in 2015 remaining comparable to 2014. Decreases primarily resulted from a production scale-back at various mines discussed above, lower compensation expense and reduced selling expense resulting from lower coal sales prices and a favorable sales mix. These decreases were partially offset by increased operating expenses resulting from the assumption of operations at the Hamilton mine and a full year of production operations at our Gibson South mine. On a per ton basis, operating expenses and outside coal purchases decreased by 1.7% to $34.22 per ton sold in 2015 from $34.82 per ton sold in 2014, primarily as a result of lower operating expenses discussed above and increased coal volumes at lower cost per ton mines, partially offset by the impact of scaled back production at our Tunnel Ridge mine. Operating expenses were impacted by various other factors, the most significant of which are discussed below:\n \u00b7 Labor and benefit expenses per ton produced, excluding workers' compensation, decreased 1.5% to $11.55 per ton in 2015 from $11.72 per ton in 2014. This decrease of $0.17 per ton was primarily attributable to a favorable production mix in 2015 discussed above, lower production-related bonus compensation and reduced overtime hours as a result of reduced unit shifts at certain mines, offset partially by higher medical expenses in 2015; \n \u00b7 Material and supplies expenses per ton produced decreased 3.0% to $11.25 per ton in 2015 from $11.60 per ton in 2014. The decrease of $0.35 per ton produced resulted primarily from the benefits of increased production and a favorable production mix in 2015 discussed above and related decreases of $0.31 per ton for roof support supplies and $0.13 per ton for certain ventilation related materials and supplies expenses, partially offset by an increase of $0.10 per ton in longwall subsidence expense; \n \u00b7 Production taxes and royalties expenses incurred as a percentage of coal sales prices and volumes decreased $0.45 per produced ton sold in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of lower average coal sales prices and a favorable sales mix as discussed above and increased brokerage coal sales which have minimal production taxes and royalty expenses if any; and \n \u00b7 Operating expenses also benefited from a $4.4 million gain reflecting a reduction in the estimated value, due to lower coal sales prices, of contingent consideration potentially payable in the White Oak Acquisition. \nOperating expenses and outside coal purchases per ton decreases discussed above were partially offset by the following increases:\n \u00b7 Operating expenses for 2015 increased as a result of the benefit of $7.0 million of insurance proceeds in 2014 related to claims from an adverse geological event at the Onton mine in 2013 and a gain of $4.4 million recognized in 2014 on the sale of Pontiki's assets, both of which were absent in 2015. In May 2014, Pontiki completed the sale of most of its assets, including certain coal reserves, mining equipment and infrastructure and surface facilities. \nOther sales and operating revenues. Other sales and operating revenues are principally comprised of Mt. Vernon transloading revenues, Matrix Group sales, surface facility services and coal royalty revenues received from White Oak prior to the White Oak Acquisition and other outside services and administrative services revenue from affiliates. Other sales and operating revenues increased to $82.1 million for 2015 from $66.1 million for 2014. The increase of $16.0 million was primarily attributable to White Oak's start-up of longwall production and resulting increased surface facility services and coal royalty revenues prior to the White Oak Acquisition and increased revenues at our Mt. Vernon operations\nprimarily due to increased transloading fees from White Oak prior to the White Oak Acquisition, partially offset by decreased payments-in-lieu-of-shipments received from a customer related to an Appalachian coal supply agreement.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses for 2015 decreased to $67.5 million compared to $72.6 million in 2014. The decrease of $5.1 million was primarily due to lower incentive compensation expenses.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased to $333.7 million for 2015 from $274.6 million for 2014. The increase of $59.1 million was attributable to the reduction of the economic mine life at our Elk Creek mine, which closed near the end of the first quarter of 2016, increased production at the Gibson South mine, which commenced initial production in April 2014, amortization of coal supply agreements acquired in December 2014 and the addition of the Hamilton mine in late July 2015.\nAsset impairment. In 2015, we recorded $100.1 million of impairment charges comprised of a $66.9 million impairment related to the idling of our Onton mine, a $19.5 million impairment at the MC Mining complex, primarily due to lower coal sales prices, and a $13.7 million impairment due to the surrender in 2015 of leases of undeveloped coal reserves and related property.\nInterest expense. Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, decreased to $31.2 million in 2015 from $33.6 million in 2014. The decrease of $2.4 million was principally attributable to the repayment of our Series A senior notes in June 2015 partially offset by interest incurred on debt assumed in the White Oak Acquisition and an increase in the principal balance of our revolving credit facility. Our debt instruments are discussed in more detail below under \"-Debt Obligations.\"\nEquity in loss of affiliates. Equity in loss of affiliates for 2015 includes our equity investments in White Oak prior to the White Oak Acquisition and AllDale Minerals. In 2014, our equity investments also include MAC. For 2015, we recognized equity in loss of affiliates of $49.0 million compared to $16.6 million for 2014. The increase in equity in loss of affiliates is primarily due to low coal sales price realizations and higher expenses related to White Oak's ramp up of longwall operations in 2015 prior to the White Oak Acquisition and the impact of changes in allocations of equity income or losses resulting from reduced equity contributions during 2015 from another White Oak partner.\nAcquisition gain, net. In 2015, we recognized a $22.5 million non-cash net gain related to the final business combination accounting for the White Oak Acquisition. For more information on the White Oak Acquisition, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 3. Acquisitions.\"\nTransportation revenues and expenses. Transportation revenues and expenses were $33.6 million and $26.0 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase of $7.6 million was primarily attributable to increased tonnage for which we arrange transportation at certain mines, partially offset by a decrease in average transportation rates in 2015. The cost of transportation services are passed through to our customers. Consequently, we do not realize any gain or loss on transportation revenues.\nSegment Information. Our 2015 Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 7.0% to $814.7 million from 2014 Segment Adjusted EBITDA of $876.2 million. Segment Adjusted EBITDA, tons sold, coal sales, other sales and operating revenues and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense by segment are as follows:\n\n (1) Percentage change was greater than or equal to 100%. \n (2) For a definition of Segment Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense and related reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures, please see below under \"-Reconciliation of non-GAAP \"Segment Adjusted EBITDA\" to GAAP \"net income\" and reconciliation of non-GAAP \"Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense\" to GAAP \"Operating Expenses.\" \nIllinois Basin - Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased slightly by 0.1% to $617.1 million in 2015 from $616.7 million in 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to increased surface facility services and coal royalty revenues received from White Oak prior to the White Oak Acquisition as well as decreased expenses per ton resulting from a favorable production mix, partially offset by lower coal sales, which decreased 2.4% to $1.57 billion in 2015 from $1.61 billion in 2014, and higher equity in loss of affiliates from White Oak prior to the White Oak Acquisition as discussed above. The decrease of $38.1 million in coal sales primarily reflects lower average coal sales prices of $51.01 in 2015 compared to $52.67 in 2014 resulting from current market conditions discussed above and the assumption of lower-priced legacy\ncontracts inherited in the White Oak Acquisition, partially offset by increased tons sold, which increased 0.8% to 30.8 million tons in 2015 compared to 30.5 million tons in 2014. Higher coal sales volumes resulted from our Gibson South mine and the assumption of operations at the Hamilton mine, partially offset by lower recoveries and shift reductions at our River View, Warrior and Gibson North mines, shift reductions at our Onton mine, as well as the shutdown of operations at our Gibson North and Onton mines in the fourth quarter of 2015, all in response to weak coal demand. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense decreased 5.1% to $949.3 million in 2015 from $1.00 billion in 2014 and decreased $1.92 per ton sold to $30.82 from $32.74 per ton sold in 2014, primarily due to the favorable production mix in 2015, partially offset by insurance proceeds received in 2014 related to the Onton mine discussed above, as well as the impact of certain other cost increases and decreases described above under \"-Operating expenses and outside coal purchases.\"\nAppalachia - Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $183.9 million for 2015 as compared to $254.0 million for 2014. The decrease of $70.1 million was primarily attributable to lower average coal sales prices as a result of market conditions, lower production recoveries across the region and decreased payments in lieu of shipments received from a customer related to a Tunnel Ridge coal supply agreement. Coal sales decreased 4.3% to $573.5 million in 2015 compared to $599.3 million in 2014. The decrease of $25.8 million was primarily attributable to lower average coal sales prices of $60.75 per ton sold during 2015 compared to $65.26 per ton sold in 2014 reflecting the impact of market conditions on sales from our Tunnel Ridge and MC Mining mines, partially offset by increased tons sold, which increased 2.8% to 9.4 million tons in 2015 compared to 9.2 million tons sold in 2014 as a result of increased sales volumes at our Tunnel Ridge and Mettiki mines. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense increased 9.9% to $400.7 million in 2015 from $364.7 million in 2014 and increased $2.73 per ton sold to $42.45 from $39.72 per ton sold in 2014, primarily due to lower recoveries and reduced production at our Tunnel Ridge mine as a result of lower coal demand and the need to manage coal inventories, partially offset by the benefit of fewer longwall move days in 2015, as well as the impact of certain other cost increases and decreases discussed above under \"-Operating expenses and outside coal purchases.\"\nOther and Corporate - Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $17.6 million to $26.2 million in 2015 from $8.6 million in 2014 and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense increased to $153.7 million for 2015 from $25.5 million in 2014. These increases were primarily as a result of increased Mt. Vernon transloading services and intercompany related activity such as increased coal brokerage activity, MAC sales and revenues and expenses of AROP Funding and Wildcat Insurance, which are eliminated upon consolidation. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense also increased in 2015 due to the absence of the benefit of a gain of $4.4 million recognized in 2014 on the sale of Pontiki's assets.\nElimination - Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense and coal sales eliminations significantly increased in 2015 to $127.2 million and $120.0 million, respectively, reflecting additional intercompany coal sales to Alliance Coal to support increased coal brokerage activity resulting from coal supply agreements acquired from Patriot Coal Corporation (\"Patriot\") on December 31, 2014. For more information on the Patriot acquisition, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 3. Acquisitions.\"\nReconciliation of non-GAAP \"Segment Adjusted EBITDA\" to GAAP \"net income\" and reconciliation of non-GAAP \"Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense\" to GAAP \"Operating Expenses\"\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) is defined as net income (prior to the allocation of noncontrolling interest) before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, asset impairment, acquisition gain, net and general and administrative expenses. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is a key component of consolidated EBITDA, which is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others. We believe that the presentation of EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our performance and results of operations because EBITDA, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, (i) provides additional information about our core operating performance and ability to generate and distribute cash flow, (ii) provides investors with the financial analytical framework upon which we base financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions and (iii) presents a measurement that investors, rating agencies and debt holders have indicated is useful in assessing us and our results of operations.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA is also used as a supplemental financial measure by our management for reasons similar to those stated in the previous explanation of EBITDA. In addition, the exclusion of corporate general and administrative expenses, which are discussed above under \"-Analysis of Historical Results of Operations,\" from consolidated Segment Adjusted EBITDA allows management to focus solely on the evaluation of segment operating profitability as it relates to our revenues and operating expenses, which are primarily controlled by our segments.\nThe following is a reconciliation of consolidated Segment Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most comparable GAAP financial measure:\n\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA Expense (a non-GAAP financial measure) includes operating expenses, outside coal purchases and other income. Transportation expenses are excluded as these expenses are passed through to our customers and, consequently, we do not realize any gain or loss on transportation revenues. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense is used as a supplemental financial measure by our management to assess the operating performance of our segments. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense is a key component of Segment Adjusted EBITDA in addition to coal sales and other sales and operating revenues. The exclusion of corporate general and administrative expenses from Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense allows management to focus solely on the evaluation of segment operating performance as it primarily relates to our operating expenses. Outside coal purchases are included in Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense because tons sold and coal sales include sales from outside coal purchases.\nThe following is a reconciliation of consolidated Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense to operating expense, the most comparable GAAP financial measure:\n\nOngoing Acquisition Activities\nConsistent with our business strategy, from time to time we engage in discussions with potential sellers regarding our possible acquisitions of certain assets and/or companies of the sellers. For more information on acquisitions, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 3. Acquisitions.\"\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nWe have historically satisfied our working capital requirements and funded our capital expenditures, equity investments and debt service obligations with cash generated from operations, cash provided by the issuance of debt or equity, borrowings under credit and securitization facilities and sale-leaseback transactions. We believe that existing cash balances, future cash flows from operations, borrowings under credit facilities, sale-leaseback transactions and cash provided from the issuance of debt or equity will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and additional equity investments, debt payments, commitments and distribution payments. Nevertheless, our ability to satisfy our working capital requirements, to fund planned capital expenditures and equity investments, to service our debt obligations or to pay distributions will depend upon our future operating performance and access to and cost of financing sources, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions generally and in the coal industry\nspecifically, as well as other financial and business factors, some of which are beyond our control. Based on our recent operating results, current cash position, current unitholder distributions, anticipated future cash flows and sources of financing that we expect to have available, we do not anticipate any constraints to our liquidity at this time. However, to the extent operating cash flow or access to and cost of financing sources are materially different than expected, future liquidity may be adversely affected. Please see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\"\nWe own through our consolidated affiliate, Cavalier Minerals, an equity interest in AllDale Minerals for the purchase of oil and gas mineral interests in various geographic locations within producing basins in the continental U.S. and plan to make similar additional equity investments in the future. As of December 31, 2016, Cavalier Minerals had provided funding of $142.7 million to AllDale Minerals and had a remaining commitment of $6.3 million, which was funded in 2017. For more information on transactions with Cavalier Minerals and AllDale Minerals, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 10. Variable Interest Entities\" and \"Note 11. Equity Investments.\"\nIn February 2017, Alliance Minerals committed to directly (rather than through Cavalier Minerals) invest $30.0 million over the next two years in AllDale III which was created for similar investment purposes as AllDale Minerals.\nOn September 22, 2011, we entered into a series of transactions with White Oak to support development of the White Oak longwall mining operation (now known as the Hamilton mine) including the purchase of preferred equity interests. On July 31, 2015 (\"White Oak Acquisition Date\"), we paid $50.0 million to acquire the remaining equity interest in White Oak and assumed control of the mine. Prior to the White Oak Acquisition Date, we had funded $422.6 million to White Oak under various agreements inclusive of the preferred equity interest purchases. In conjunction with the acquisition of White Oak, we assumed $93.5 million of debt which was extinguished in the fourth quarter of 2015 and replaced with a $100 million equipment sale-leaseback arrangement. For more information on this sale-leaseback arrangement, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies.\" In 2014 and 2015, we paid $48.0 million to Patriot and $11.6 million to CONSOL Energy, Inc. to acquire various assets, including certain mining equipment and reserves. We also paid $5.5 million in 2015 to acquire the remaining equity interest in MAC. For more information on our acquisitions, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 3. Acquisitions.\"\nCash Flows\nCash provided by operating activities was $703.5 million in 2016 compared to $716.3 million in 2015. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in net income as adjusted for non-cash items and an increase in trade receivables during 2016 compared to a decrease in 2015. These decreases in cash provided by operating activities were offset in part by additional cash flows received from a reduction in coal inventories in 2016, a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets in 2016, lower payments made on accounts payable in 2016 as compared to 2015 and an increase in payroll and related benefits accruals in 2016 compared to a decrease in 2015.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $191.8 million in 2016 compared to $355.9 million in 2015. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to lower capital expenditures for mine infrastructure and equipment at various mines and a decrease in acquisition activity in 2016, offset in part by increased equity investments in affiliates and the acquisition of customer contracts in 2016. Reduced capital expenditures for mining equipment reflects in part deployment efforts for used mining equipment acquired through acquisitions in 2015 and continued re-deployment of equipment from our recently idled or closed mines previously discussed.\nNet cash used in financing activities was", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGeneral\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following financial information, please see \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 1. Organization and Presentation and Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\"\nExecutive Overview\nWe are a diversified producer and marketer of coal primarily to major U.S. utilities and industrial users and were the first such producer and marketer in the nation to be a publicly traded master limited partnership. We are currently the second-largest coal producer in the eastern U.S. In 2016, we produced and sold 35.2 million and 36.7 million tons of coal, respectively. The coal we produced in 2016 was approximately 15.2% low-sulfur coal, 63.8% medium-sulfur coal and 21.0% high-sulfur coal. Based on market expectations, we classify low-sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of less than 1.5%, medium-sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of 1.5% to 3%, and high-sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of greater than 3%. The BTU content of our coal ranges from 11,400 to 13,200.\nWe operate eight underground mining complexes, including the Hamilton longwall mining complex in southern Illinois which we acquired on July 31, 2015 by purchasing the remaining equity ownership in White Oak and operate a coal-loading terminal on the Ohio River at Mt. Vernon, Indiana. Prior to July 31, 2015, we owned a non-controlling, preferred equity interest in White Oak, leased coal reserves to White Oak and owned and operated certain surface facilities at White Oak's mining complex. We also own the idled Onton mine and idled Gibson North mine. In addition, we own through our consolidated affiliate, Cavalier Minerals, an equity interest in AllDale Minerals for the purchase of oil and gas mineral interests in various geographic locations within producing basins in the continental U.S. and plan to make similar additional equity investments. At December 31, 2016, we had approximately 1.76 billion tons of proven and probable coal reserves in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. We believe we control adequate reserves to implement our currently contemplated mining plans. Please see \"Item 1. Business-Mining Operations\" for further discussion of our mines.\nIn 2016, approximately 90.3% of our sales tonnage was purchased by electric utilities, with the balance sold to third-party resellers and industrial consumers. Although many utility customers recently have appeared to favor a shorter-term contracting strategy, in 2016, approximately 87.7% of our sales tonnage was sold under long-term contracts. Our long-term contracts contribute to our stability and profitability by providing greater predictability of sales volumes and sales prices. In 2016, approximately 93.0% of our medium- and high-sulfur coal was sold to utility plants with installed pollution control devices. These devices, also known as scrubbers, eliminate substantially all emissions of sulfur dioxide.\nAs discussed in more detail in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors,\" our results of operations could be impacted by prices for items that are used in coal production such as steel, electricity and other supplies, unforeseen geologic conditions or mining and processing equipment failures and unexpected maintenance problems, and by the availability or reliability of transportation for coal shipments. Additionally, our results of operations could be impacted by our ability to obtain and renew permits necessary for our operations, secure or acquire coal reserves, or find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts. Moreover, the regulatory environment has grown increasingly stringent in recent years. As outlined in \"Item 1. Business-Regulation and Laws,\" a variety of measures taken by regulatory agencies in the U.S. and abroad in response to the perceived threat from climate change attributed to GHG emissions could substantially increase compliance costs for us and our customers and reduce demand for coal, which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations. For additional information regarding some of the risks and uncertainties that affect our business and the industry in which we operate, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\"\nOur principal expenses related to the production of coal are labor and benefits, equipment, materials and supplies, maintenance, royalties and excise taxes. We employ a totally union-free workforce. Many of the benefits of our union-free workforce are related to higher productivity and are not necessarily reflected in our direct costs. In addition, transportation costs may be substantial and are often the determining factor in a coal consumer's contracting decision.\nOur mining operations are located near many of the major eastern utility generating plants and on major coal hauling railroads in the eastern U.S. Our River View and Tunnel Ridge mines and Mt. Vernon transloading facility are located on the Ohio River and our idled Onton mine is located on the Green River in western Kentucky.\nOur primary business strategy is to create sustainable, capital-efficient growth in available cash to maximize distributions to our unitholders by:\n \u00b7 expanding our operations by adding and developing mines and coal reserves in existing, adjacent or neighboring properties; \n \u00b7 extending the lives of our current mining operations through acquisition and development of coal reserves using our existing infrastructure; \n \u00b7 continuing to make productivity improvements to remain a low-cost producer in each region in which we operate; \n \u00b7 strengthening our position with existing and future customers by offering a broad range of coal qualities, transportation alternatives and customized services; \n \u00b7 developing strategic relationships to take advantage of opportunities within the coal industry and MLP sector; and \n \u00b7 making equity investments for the purchase of oil and gas mineral interests in various geographic locations within producing basins in the continental U.S. \nWe have two reportable segments: Illinois Basin and Appalachia, and an \"all other\" category referred to as Other and Corporate. Our reportable segments correspond to major coal producing regions in the eastern U.S. Factors similarly affecting financial performance of our operating segments within each of these two reportable segments generally include coal quality, geology, coal marketing opportunities, mining and transportation methods and regulatory issues.\n \u00b7 Illinois Basin reportable segment is comprised of multiple operating segments, including the following current operating mining complexes: a) Webster County Coal's Dotiki mining complex, b) Gibson County Coal's mining complex, which includes the Gibson North mine (currently idled) and Gibson South mine, c) Warrior's mining complex, d) River View's mining complex and e) the Hamilton mining complex. In April 2014, initial production began at the Gibson South mine. The Gibson North mine has been idled since the fourth quarter of 2015 in response to market conditions. \nThe Illinois Basin reportable segment also includes White County Coal's Pattiki mining complex, Hopkins County Coal's mining complex, which includes the Elk Creek mine, the Pleasant View surface mineable reserves and the Fies underground project, Sebree's mining complex, which includes the Onton mine, Steamport and certain Sebree reserves, CR Services, LLC, CR Machine Shop, LLC, certain properties and equipment of Alliance Resource Properties, ARP Sebree, LLC (\"ARP Sebree\"), ARP Sebree South, LLC, UC Coal, LLC and its subsidiaries, UC Mining, LLC, and UC Processing, LLC. The Pattiki mine ceased production in December 2016. The Elk Creek mine depleted its reserves in March 2016 and ceased production on April 1, 2016. The Sebree properties, the Pleasant View surface mineable reserves and the Fies underground project are held by us for future mine development. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we idled our Onton mine in response to market conditions. In the fourth quarter of 2014 and February 2015, Alliance Resource Properties acquired reserves that would allow increased production from our River View mine, add three new potential development projects for our organic growth strategy and may significantly extend the life of the Dotiki mine. UC Coal, LLC equipment assets acquired in 2015 continue being deployed as needed at various Illinois Basin operating mines. For information regarding the permitting process and matters that could hinder or delay the process, please read \"Item 1. Business-Regulation and Laws-Mining Permits and Approvals\". For information regarding Alliance Resource Properties' acquisition of reserves in December 2014 and February 2015 and our assumption of control at the Hamilton mine in July 2015, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 3. Acquisitions.\"\n \u00b7 Appalachia reportable segment is comprised of multiple operating segments, including the Mettiki mining complex, the Tunnel Ridge mining complex and the MC Mining mining complex. The Mettiki mining complex includes Mettiki Coal (WV)'s Mountain View mine and Mettiki Coal's preparation plant. During the fourth quarter 2015, we surrendered the Penn Ridge lease as those reserves were no longer a core part of our foreseeable development plans. Please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 4. Long-Lived Asset Impairment\" for further discussion of this surrender. \n \u00b7 Other and Corporate includes marketing and administrative expenses, Alliance Service, Inc. (\"ASI\") and its subsidiaries included in the Matrix Group, ASI's ownership of aircraft, Mt. Vernon's dock activities; coal brokerage activity, MAC's manufacturing and sales (primarily to our mines) of rock dust, certain activities of Alliance Resource Properties, throughput receivables and prior workers' compensation and pneumoconiosis liabilities from Pontiki Coal, LLC (\"Pontiki\"), which sold most of its assets in May 2014, Wildcat Insurance, which was established in September 2014 to assist the ARLP Partnership with its insurance requirements, Alliance Minerals and its affiliate, Cavalier Minerals, which holds equity investments in AllDale Minerals and AROP Funding, LLC (\"AROP Funding\"). Please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 7. Long-Term Debt\", \"-Note 10. Variable Interest Entities\" and \"-Note 11. Equity Investments\" for more information on AROP Funding, Alliance Minerals, Cavalier Minerals and AllDale Minerals. \nHow We Evaluate Our Performance\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operational measurements to analyze our performance. Primary measurements include the following: (1) raw and saleable tons produced per unit shift; (2) coal sales price per ton; (3) Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton; (4) EBITDA; and (5) Segment Adjusted EBITDA.\nRaw and Saleable Tons Produced per Unit Shift. We review raw and saleable tons produced per unit shift as part of our operational analysis to measure the productivity of our operating segments, which is significantly influenced by mining conditions and the efficiency of our preparation plants. Our discussion of mining conditions and preparation plant costs are found below under \"-Analysis of Historical Results of Operations\" and therefore provides implicit analysis of raw and saleable tons produced per unit shift.\nCoal Sales Price per Ton. We define coal sales price per ton as total coal sales divided by tons sold. We review coal sales price per ton to evaluate marketing efforts and for market demand and trend analysis.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per Ton. We define Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton (a non-GAAP financial measure) as the sum of operating expenses, outside coal purchases and other income divided by total tons sold. We review segment adjusted EBITDA expense per ton for cost trends.\nEBITDA. We define EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) as net income (prior to the allocation of noncontrolling interest) before net interest expense, income taxes and depreciation, depletion and amortization. EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by our management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others. We believe that the presentation of EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our performance and results of operations because EBITDA, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, (i) provides additional information about our core operating performance and ability to generate and distribute cash flow, (ii) provides investors with the financial analytical framework upon which we base financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions and (iii) presents a measurement that investors, rating agencies and debt holders have indicated is useful in assessing us and our results of operations.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA. We define Segment Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) as net income (prior to the allocation of noncontrolling interest) before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, asset impairment, acquisition gain, net and general and administrative expenses. Management therefore is able to focus solely on the evaluation of segment operating profitability as it relates to our revenues and operating expenses, which are primarily controlled by our segments.\nAnalysis of Historical Results of Operations\n2016 Compared with 2015\nWe reported net income of $339.5 million for 2016 compared to $306.2 million for 2015, an increase of $33.3 million. Comparative results between the years reflect in part the negative net impact in 2015 of $77.6 million of certain large non-cash items ( Non-Cash Items\u201d) described below and $48.5 million of equity in loss of affiliates related to White Oak also in 2015. Net income in 2016 was negatively impacted by reduced revenues compared to 2015 resulting from planned reductions in coal sales and production volumes, lower coal sales prices, lower other sales and operating revenues due to the absence of coal royalty and surface facilities revenues from White Oak in 2016, offset in part by reduced operating expenses in 2016. Lower operating expenses during 2016 primarily reflect decreased sales volumes and a favorable production cost mix resulting from our initiative to shift production to lower-cost per ton operations. Lower volumes in\n2016 resulted from idling our Onton and Gibson North mines in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the planned depletion of reserves at our Elk Creek mine in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by additional volumes from our Tunnel Ridge and Gibson South operations and the Hamilton mine acquired in the White Oak Acquisition. The Non-Cash Items in 2015 included asset impairments of $100.1 million offset in part by a net gain of $22.5 million related to final business combination accounting for the White Oak Acquisition.

Coal sales decreased $296.2 million or 13.7% to $1.86 billion for 2016 from $2.16 billion for 2015. The decrease was attributable to a volume variance of $191.2 million resulting from reduced tons sold as discussed above and a price variance of $105.0 million due to lower average coal sales prices. Average coal sales prices decreased $2.86 per ton sold in 2016 to $50.76 compared to $53.62 per ton sold in 2015, primarily due to lower-priced legacy contracts at our Hamilton mine inherited in the White Oak Acquisition and lower average prices at certain mines, particularly at our Gibson South, Dotiki, Tunnel Ridge and MC Mining operations, as a result of challenging market conditions.\nOperating expenses and outside coal purchases. Operating expenses and outside coal purchases decreased 17.2% to $1.14 billion for 2016 from $1.38 billion for 2015 primarily as a result of the previously discussed reductions to coal production volumes and a favorable production cost mix. On a per ton basis, operating expenses and outside coal purchases decreased 9.1% to $31.09 per ton sold from $34.22 per ton sold in 2015, due primarily to the lower-cost production mix and higher productivity from our Tunnel Ridge and Gibson South mines. Operating expenses were impacted by various other factors, the most significant of which are discussed below:\n \u00b7 Labor and benefit expenses per ton produced, excluding workers' compensation, decreased 7.8% to $10.65 per ton in 2016 from $11.55 per ton in 2015. This decrease of $0.90 per ton was primarily attributable to the increased mix of lower-cost production discussed above and reduced overtime in response to market conditions; \n \u00b7 Material and supplies expenses per ton produced decreased 14.8% to $9.58 per ton in 2016 from $11.25 per ton in 2015. The decrease of $1.67 per ton produced resulted primarily from the increased mix of lower-cost production discussed above and related decreases of $0.77 per ton for roof support, $0.47 per ton for contract labor used in the mining process and $0.24 per ton for certain ventilation expenses partially offset by increases of $0.22 per ton for equipment rentals primarily due to equipment leases assumed in the White Oak Acquisition and $0.15 per ton for environmental and reclamation expenses; \n \u00b7 Maintenance expenses per ton produced decreased 21.1% to $3.10 per ton in 2016 from $3.93 per ton in 2015. The decrease of $0.83 per ton produced was primarily due to production variances at certain mines discussed above; and \n \u00b7 Production taxes and royalties expenses incurred as a percentage of coal sales prices and volumes decreased $0.39 per produced ton sold in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily as a result of lower excise taxes per ton resulting from a favorable state production mix and lower average coal sales prices discussed above; \nOperating expenses and outside coal purchases per ton decreases discussed above were partially offset by the following increase:\n \u00b7 Operating expenses were increased by a 1.4 million ton inventory reduction and related inventory cost adjustments in 2016 as compared to a 1.0 million ton inventory increase and related inventory cost adjustments in 2015. \nOther sales and operating revenues. Other sales and operating revenues were principally comprised of Mt. Vernon transloading revenues, Matrix Design sales, other outside services and administrative services revenue from affiliates and, in 2015, surface facility services and coal royalty revenues received from White Oak prior to the White Oak Acquisition in July 2015. Other sales and operating revenues decreased to $39.6 million in 2016 from $82.1 million in 2015. The decrease of $42.5 million was primarily due to the absence of coal royalty and surface facilities revenues from White Oak in 2016.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses for 2016 increased to $72.5 million compared to $67.5 million in 2015. The increase of $5.0 million was primarily due to higher incentive compensation expenses.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense (\"DD&A\") for 2016 decreased to $322.5 million compared to $333.7 million in 2015. The decrease of $11.2 million was primarily due to previously discussed volume reductions at our Onton, Gibson North and Elk Creek mines, partially offset by increases in DD&A associated with the acquisition of the Hamilton mine in July 2015 and at our Pattiki mine, which ceased production in December 2016.\nAsset impairment. In 2015, we recorded $100.1 million of impairment charges comprised of a $66.9 million impairment related to the idling of our Onton mine, a $19.5 million impairment at the MC Mining complex, primarily due to lower coal sales prices, and a $13.7 million impairment due to the surrender in 2015 of leases of undeveloped coal reserves and related property. No asset impairments were recorded in 2016.\nInterest expense. Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, decreased slightly to $30.7 million in 2016 from $31.2 million in 2015 primarily due to the repayment of our Series A senior notes in June 2015 offset in part by additional interest incurred under capital lease obligations. Interest payable under our senior notes, term loan, revolving credit facility and capital lease financings is discussed below under \"-Debt Obligations.\"\nEquity in income (loss) of affiliates. Equity in income (loss) of affiliates for 2016 includes Cavalier Minerals' equity investments in AllDale Minerals. In addition to AllDale Minerals, 2015 also includes our equity investment in White Oak. For 2016, we recognized equity in income of affiliates of $3.5 million compared to equity in loss of affiliates of $49.0 million for 2015. As discussed above, as a result of the White Oak Acquisition in July 2015, we no longer account for the Hamilton mine financial results as an equity investment in our consolidated financials, but now consolidate Hamilton in our financial results. Thus, the change in equity in earnings of affiliates was primarily due to the elimination of equity losses related to White Oak as well as an increase in equity earnings from AllDale Minerals.\nAcquisition gain, net. In 2015, we recognized a $22.5 million non-cash net gain related to the final business combination accounting for the White Oak Acquisition. For more information on the White Oak Acquisition, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 3. Acquisitions.\"\nTransportation revenues and expenses. Transportation revenues and expenses were $30.1 million and $33.6 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease of $3.5 million was primarily attributable to a decrease in average transportation rates in 2016, partially offset by increased tonnage for which we arrange transportation at certain mines. The cost of transportation services are passed through to our customers. Consequently, we do not realize any gain or loss on transportation revenues.\nSegment Information. Our 2016 Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 6.1% to $765.2 million from 2015 Segment Adjusted EBITDA of $814.7 million.

For a definition of Segment Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense and related reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures, please see below under \"-Reconciliation of non-GAAP \"Segment Adjusted EBITDA\" to GAAP \"net income\" and reconciliation of non-GAAP \"Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense\" to GAAP \"Operating Expenses.\" \nIllinois Basin - Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 12.8% to $538.1 million in 2016 from $617.1 million in 2015, a decrease of $79.0 million. Segment Adjusted EBITDA in 2016 was negatively impacted by reduced revenues compared to 2015 resulting from planned reductions in coal sales and production volumes, lower coal sales prices, lower other sales and operating revenues due to the absence of coal royalty and surface facilities revenues from White Oak in 2016, offset in part by reduced operating expenses in 2016. Comparative results between the years also reflect the negative impact in 2015 of $48.5 million of equity in loss of affiliates related to White Oak prior to the White Oak Acquisition in July 2015. Coal sales decreased 16.9% to $1.31 billion compared to $1.57 billion in 2015. The coal sales decrease of $264.8 million primarily reflects the previously discussed reduction of coal sales and production volumes at our Onton, Gibson North and Elk Creek mines, partially offset by additional volumes from our Gibson South operation and the Hamilton mine acquired in the White Oak Acquisition. Also impacting 2016 were lower average coal sales prices which decreased 4.8% to $48.54\nper ton sold compared to $51.01 per ton sold in 2015 as a result of challenging market conditions and lower-priced legacy contracts at the Hamilton mine inherited in the White Oak Acquisition. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense decreased 18.3% to $775.9 million in 2016 from $949.3 million in 2015 due to reduced production and sales volumes as discussed above. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton decreased $1.99 per ton sold to $28.83 in 2016 from $30.82 per ton sold in 2015, primarily as a result of a favorable production cost mix in 2016 due to reducing production from higher-cost per ton operations and improved recoveries at our Gibson South, River View and Warrior mines, as well as certain cost decreases described above under \"-Operating expenses and outside coal purchases.\"\nAppalachia - Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 4.2% to $191.7 million for 2016 from $183.9 million in 2015. The increase of $7.8 million was primarily attributable to increased tons sold and reduced operating expenses partially offset by lower average coal sales prices of $54.94 per ton sold during 2016 compared to $60.76 per ton sold in 2015. Coal sales decreased 6.7% to $534.8 million in 2016 compared to $573.5 million in 2015. The decrease of $38.7 million was primarily due to lower average coal sales prices at our MC Mining and Tunnel Ridge mines. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense decreased 13.5% to $346.5 million in 2016 from $400.7 million in 2015 and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton decreased $6.85 per ton sold to $35.60 compared to $42.45 per ton sold in 2015, primarily due to a favorable production cost mix resulting from an additional 1.0 million tons being produced from Tunnel Ridge in 2016 compared to 2015 and a reduction in volumes from our higher cost Appalachia mines. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton also benefited from fewer longwall move days and lower roof support expenses, lower selling expenses across the region, and certain other cost decreases described above under \"-Operating expenses and outside coal purchases.\"\nOther and Corporate - In 2016, Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $20.2 million compared to 2015 primarily as a result of increased margins on both safety equipment sales by Matrix Design and coal brokerage sales, as well as an increase in equity earnings from AllDale Minerals and a reduction in workers' compensation and pneumoconiosis accruals related to Pontiki which sold most of its assets in May 2014. In 2016, coal sales decreased $47.3 million and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense decreased $64.1 million compared to 2015. These decreases primarily resulted from reduced intercompany coal brokerage activity.\nElimination - Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense eliminations decreased in 2016 to $72.3 million from $127.2 million in 2015 and coal sales eliminations decreased to $65.4 million from $120.0 million, respectively, primarily reflecting reduced intercompany coal brokerage activity.\n2015 Compared with 2014\nWe reported net income of $306.2 million for 2015 compared to $497.2 million for 2014. The decrease of $191.0 million was principally due to non-cash asset impairments of $100.1 million, lower average coal sales prices particularly at our Appalachian segment mines, increased depreciation, depletion and amortization and higher equity in loss of affiliates, partially offset by record coal sales volumes, increased coal volumes at lower cost per ton operations, a net gain of $22.5 million related to the final business combination accounting for the White Oak Acquisition and increased other sales and operating revenues primarily reflecting higher surface facility services and coal royalties from White Oak prior to the White Oak Acquisition.

Coal sales decreased 2.3% to $2.16 billion for 2015 from $2.21 billion for 2014. The decrease of $50.6 million in coal sales reflected lower average coal sales prices, which reduced coal sales by $79.3 million, partially offset by the benefit of record tons sold, which contributed $28.7 million in additional coal sales. Average coal sales prices decreased by $1.97 to $53.62 per ton sold in 2015 compared to $55.59 per ton sold in 2014, primarily as a result of market conditions impacted by reduced coal demand at utilities due to low natural gas prices, regulatory pressures that caused\ncoal to gas switching or plant closures and high inventories. The decline in average sales prices was particularly noticeable for our Appalachian segment, decreasing $4.51 per ton to $60.75. In addition, average coal sales prices were impacted by lower-priced legacy contracts inherited in the White Oak Acquisition. Sales and production volumes rose to 40.2 million tons sold and 41.2 million tons produced in 2015 compared to 39.7 million tons sold and 40.7 million tons produced in 2014, primarily due to the addition of Hamilton production beginning August 1, 2015, the ramp up of coal production at our Gibson South mine following the commencement of operations in April 2014 and increased sales at our Tunnel Ridge and Mettiki mines. Volume increases were partially offset by lower sales at our Warrior, Gibson North, River View and Onton mines due to shift reductions, the shutdown of operations at our Gibson North and Onton mines in the fourth quarter of 2015 and scaled backed production at our Tunnel Ridge mine during the second half of 2015, all in response to weak coal demand, as well as an inventory build at several locations. In addition to shift reductions, reduced production from Warrior resulted from its continuing transition to a new mining area.\nOperating expenses and outside coal purchases. Operating expenses and outside coal purchases decreased 0.4% to $1.38 billion in 2015 remaining comparable to 2014. Decreases primarily resulted from a production scale-back at various mines discussed above, lower compensation expense and reduced selling expense resulting from lower coal sales prices and a favorable sales mix. These decreases were partially offset by increased operating expenses resulting from the assumption of operations at the Hamilton mine and a full year of production operations at our Gibson South mine. On a per ton basis, operating expenses and outside coal purchases decreased by 1.7% to $34.22 per ton sold in 2015 from $34.82 per ton sold in 2014, primarily as a result of lower operating expenses discussed above and increased coal volumes at lower cost per ton mines, partially offset by the impact of scaled back production at our Tunnel Ridge mine. Operating expenses were impacted by various other factors, the most significant of which are discussed below:\n \u00b7 Labor and benefit expenses per ton produced, excluding workers' compensation, decreased 1.5% to $11.55 per ton in 2015 from $11.72 per ton in 2014. This decrease of $0.17 per ton was primarily attributable to a favorable production mix in 2015 discussed above, lower production-related bonus compensation and reduced overtime hours as a result of reduced unit shifts at certain mines, offset partially by higher medical expenses in 2015; \n \u00b7 Material and supplies expenses per ton produced decreased 3.0% to $11.25 per ton in 2015 from $11.60 per ton in 2014. The decrease of $0.35 per ton produced resulted primarily from the benefits of increased production and a favorable production mix in 2015 discussed above and related decreases of $0.31 per ton for roof support supplies and $0.13 per ton for certain ventilation related materials and supplies expenses, partially offset by an increase of $0.10 per ton in longwall subsidence expense; \n \u00b7 Production taxes and royalties expenses incurred as a percentage of coal sales prices and volumes decreased $0.45 per produced ton sold in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of lower average coal sales prices and a favorable sales mix as discussed above and increased brokerage coal sales which have minimal production taxes and royalty expenses if any; and \n \u00b7 Operating expenses also benefited from a $4.4 million gain reflecting a reduction in the estimated value, due to lower coal sales prices, of contingent consideration potentially payable in the White Oak Acquisition. \nOperating expenses and outside coal purchases per ton decreases discussed above were partially offset by the following increases:\n \u00b7 Operating expenses for 2015 increased as a result of the benefit of $7.0 million of insurance proceeds in 2014 related to claims from an adverse geological event at the Onton mine in 2013 and a gain of $4.4 million recognized in 2014 on the sale of Pontiki's assets, both of which were absent in 2015. In May 2014, Pontiki completed the sale of most of its assets, including certain coal reserves, mining equipment and infrastructure and surface facilities. \nOther sales and operating revenues. Other sales and operating revenues are principally comprised of Mt. Vernon transloading revenues, Matrix Group sales, surface facility services and coal royalty revenues received from White Oak prior to the White Oak Acquisition and other outside services and administrative services revenue from affiliates. Other sales and operating revenues increased to $82.1 million for 2015 from $66.1 million for 2014. The increase of $16.0 million was primarily attributable to White Oak's start-up of longwall production and resulting increased surface facility services and coal royalty revenues prior to the White Oak Acquisition and increased revenues at our Mt. Vernon operations\nprimarily due to increased transloading fees from White Oak prior to the White Oak Acquisition, partially offset by decreased payments-in-lieu-of-shipments received from a customer related to an Appalachian coal supply agreement.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses for 2015 decreased to $67.5 million compared to $72.6 million in 2014. The decrease of $5.1 million was primarily due to lower incentive compensation expenses.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased to $333.7 million for 2015 from $274.6 million for 2014. The increase of $59.1 million was attributable to the reduction of the economic mine life at our Elk Creek mine, which closed near the end of the first quarter of 2016, increased production at the Gibson South mine, which commenced initial production in April 2014, amortization of coal supply agreements acquired in December 2014 and the addition of the Hamilton mine in late July 2015.\nAsset impairment. In 2015, we recorded $100.1 million of impairment charges comprised of a $66.9 million impairment related to the idling of our Onton mine, a $19.5 million impairment at the MC Mining complex, primarily due to lower coal sales prices, and a $13.7 million impairment due to the surrender in 2015 of leases of undeveloped coal reserves and related property.\nInterest expense. Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, decreased to $31.2 million in 2015 from $33.6 million in 2014. The decrease of $2.4 million was principally attributable to the repayment of our Series A senior notes in June 2015 partially offset by interest incurred on debt assumed in the White Oak Acquisition and an increase in the principal balance of our revolving credit facility. Our debt instruments are discussed in more detail below under \"-Debt Obligations.\"\nEquity in loss of affiliates. Equity in loss of affiliates for 2015 includes our equity investments in White Oak prior to the White Oak Acquisition and AllDale Minerals. In 2014, our equity investments also include MAC. For 2015, we recognized equity in loss of affiliates of $49.0 million compared to $16.6 million for 2014. The increase in equity in loss of affiliates is primarily due to low coal sales price realizations and higher expenses related to White Oak's ramp up of longwall operations in 2015 prior to the White Oak Acquisition and the impact of changes in allocations of equity income or losses resulting from reduced equity contributions during 2015 from another White Oak partner.\nAcquisition gain, net. In 2015, we recognized a $22.5 million non-cash net gain related to the final business combination accounting for the White Oak Acquisition. For more information on the White Oak Acquisition, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 3. Acquisitions.\"\nTransportation revenues and expenses. Transportation revenues and expenses were $33.6 million and $26.0 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase of $7.6 million was primarily attributable to increased tonnage for which we arrange transportation at certain mines, partially offset by a decrease in average transportation rates in 2015. The cost of transportation services are passed through to our customers. Consequently, we do not realize any gain or loss on transportation revenues.\nSegment Information. Our 2015 Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 7.0% to $814.7 million from 2014 Segment Adjusted EBITDA of $876.2 million.

\"Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense\" to GAAP \"Operating Expenses.\" \nIllinois Basin - Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased slightly by 0.1% to $617.1 million in 2015 from $616.7 million in 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to increased surface facility services and coal royalty revenues received from White Oak prior to the White Oak Acquisition as well as decreased expenses per ton resulting from a favorable production mix, partially offset by lower coal sales, which decreased 2.4% to $1.57 billion in 2015 from $1.61 billion in 2014, and higher equity in loss of affiliates from White Oak prior to the White Oak Acquisition as discussed above. The decrease of $38.1 million in coal sales primarily reflects lower average coal sales prices of $51.01 in 2015 compared to $52.67 in 2014 resulting from current market conditions discussed above and the assumption of lower-priced legacy\ncontracts inherited in the White Oak Acquisition, partially offset by increased tons sold, which increased 0.8% to 30.8 million tons in 2015 compared to 30.5 million tons in 2014. Higher coal sales volumes resulted from our Gibson South mine and the assumption of operations at the Hamilton mine, partially offset by lower recoveries and shift reductions at our River View, Warrior and Gibson North mines, shift reductions at our Onton mine, as well as the shutdown of operations at our Gibson North and Onton mines in the fourth quarter of 2015, all in response to weak coal demand. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense decreased 5.1% to $949.3 million in 2015 from $1.00 billion in 2014 and decreased $1.92 per ton sold to $30.82 from $32.74 per ton sold in 2014, primarily due to the favorable production mix in 2015, partially offset by insurance proceeds received in 2014 related to the Onton mine discussed above, as well as the impact of certain other cost increases and decreases described above under \"-Operating expenses and outside coal purchases.\"\nAppalachia - Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $183.9 million for 2015 as compared to $254.0 million for 2014. The decrease of $70.1 million was primarily attributable to lower average coal sales prices as a result of market conditions, lower production recoveries across the region and decreased payments in lieu of shipments received from a customer related to a Tunnel Ridge coal supply agreement. Coal sales decreased 4.3% to $573.5 million in 2015 compared to $599.3 million in 2014. The decrease of $25.8 million was primarily attributable to lower average coal sales prices of $60.75 per ton sold during 2015 compared to $65.26 per ton sold in 2014 reflecting the impact of market conditions on sales from our Tunnel Ridge and MC Mining mines, partially offset by increased tons sold, which increased 2.8% to 9.4 million tons in 2015 compared to 9.2 million tons sold in 2014 as a result of increased sales volumes at our Tunnel Ridge and Mettiki mines. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense increased 9.9% to $400.7 million in 2015 from $364.7 million in 2014 and increased $2.73 per ton sold to $42.45 from $39.72 per ton sold in 2014, primarily due to lower recoveries and reduced production at our Tunnel Ridge mine as a result of lower coal demand and the need to manage coal inventories, partially offset by the benefit of fewer longwall move days in 2015, as well as the impact of certain other cost increases and decreases discussed above under \"-Operating expenses and outside coal purchases.\"\nOther and Corporate - Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $17.6 million to $26.2 million in 2015 from $8.6 million in 2014 and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense increased to $153.7 million for 2015 from $25.5 million in 2014. These increases were primarily as a result of increased Mt. Vernon transloading services and intercompany related activity such as increased coal brokerage activity, MAC sales and revenues and expenses of AROP Funding and Wildcat Insurance, which are eliminated upon consolidation. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense also increased in 2015 due to the absence of the benefit of a gain of $4.4 million recognized in 2014 on the sale of Pontiki's assets.\nElimination - Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense and coal sales eliminations significantly increased in 2015 to $127.2 million and $120.0 million, respectively, reflecting additional intercompany coal sales to Alliance Coal to support increased coal brokerage activity resulting from coal supply agreements acquired from Patriot Coal Corporation (\"Patriot\") on December 31, 2014.

Acquisitions.\"\nReconciliation of non-GAAP \"Segment Adjusted EBITDA\" to GAAP \"net income\" and reconciliation of non-GAAP \"Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense\" to GAAP \"Operating Expenses\"\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) is defined as net income (prior to the allocation of noncontrolling interest) before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, asset impairment, acquisition gain, net and general and administrative expenses. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is a key component of consolidated EBITDA, which is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others. We believe that the presentation of EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our performance and results of operations because EBITDA, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, (i) provides additional information about our core operating performance and ability to generate and distribute cash flow, (ii) provides investors with the financial analytical framework upon which we base financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions and (iii) presents a measurement that investors, rating agencies and debt holders have indicated is useful in assessing us and our results of operations.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA is also used as a supplemental financial measure by our management for reasons similar to those stated in the previous explanation of EBITDA. In addition, the exclusion of corporate general and administrative expenses, which are discussed above under \"-Analysis of Historical Results of Operations,\" from consolidated Segment Adjusted EBITDA allows management to focus solely on the evaluation of segment operating profitability as it relates to our revenues and operating expenses, which are primarily controlled by our segments.\nThe following is a reconciliation of consolidated Segment Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most comparable GAAP financial measure:\nTable 198: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nConsolidated Segment Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n765,248 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n814,665 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n876,244 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeneral and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(72,529) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(67,484) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(72,552) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(322,509) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(333,713) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(274,566) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAsset impairment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(100,130) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(30,659) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(29,694) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(31,913) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAcquisition gain, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n22,548 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(13) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(21) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n339,538 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n306,171 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n497,213 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA Expense (a non-GAAP financial measure) includes operating expenses, outside coal purchases and other income. Transportation expenses are excluded as these expenses are passed through to our customers and, consequently, we do not realize any gain or loss on transportation revenues. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense is used as a supplemental financial measure by our management to assess the operating performance of our segments. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense is a key component of Segment Adjusted EBITDA in addition to coal sales and other sales and operating revenues. The exclusion of corporate general and administrative expenses from Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense allows management to focus solely on the evaluation of segment operating performance as it primarily relates to our operating expenses. Outside coal purchases are included in Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense because tons sold and coal sales include sales from outside coal purchases.\nThe following is a reconciliation of consolidated Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense to operating expense, the most comparable GAAP financial measure:\nTable 199: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,139,637 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,376,425 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,381,808 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOutside coal purchases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,514) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(327) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(14) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,566 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating expenses (excluding depreciation, depletion and amortization)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,138,848 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,377,053 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,383,360 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOngoing Acquisition Activities\nConsistent with our business strategy, from time to time we engage in discussions with potential sellers regarding our possible acquisitions of certain assets and/or companies of the sellers. For more information on acquisitions, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 3. Acquisitions.\"\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nWe have historically satisfied our working capital requirements and funded our capital expenditures, equity investments and debt service obligations with cash generated from operations, cash provided by the issuance of debt or equity, borrowings under credit and securitization facilities and sale-leaseback transactions. We believe that existing cash balances, future cash flows from operations, borrowings under credit facilities, sale-leaseback transactions and cash provided from the issuance of debt or equity will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and additional equity investments, debt payments, commitments and distribution payments. Nevertheless, our ability to satisfy our working capital requirements, to fund planned capital expenditures and equity investments, to service our debt obligations or to pay distributions will depend upon our future operating performance and access to and cost of financing sources, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions generally and in the coal industry\nspecifically, as well as other financial and business factors, some of which are beyond our control. Based on our recent operating results, current cash position, current unitholder distributions, anticipated future cash flows and sources of financing that we expect to have available, we do not anticipate any constraints to our liquidity at this time. However, to the extent operating cash flow or access to and cost of financing sources are materially different than expected, future liquidity may be adversely affected. Please see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\"\nWe own through our consolidated affiliate, Cavalier Minerals, an equity interest in AllDale Minerals for the purchase of oil and gas mineral interests in various geographic locations within producing basins in the continental U.S. and plan to make similar additional equity investments in the future. As of December 31, 2016, Cavalier Minerals had provided funding of $142.7 million to AllDale Minerals and had a remaining commitment of $6.3 million, which was funded in 2017. For more information on transactions with Cavalier Minerals and AllDale Minerals, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 10. Variable Interest Entities\" and \"Note 11. Equity Investments.\"\nIn February 2017, Alliance Minerals committed to directly (rather than through Cavalier Minerals) invest $30.0 million over the next two years in AllDale III which was created for similar investment purposes as AllDale Minerals.\nOn September 22, 2011, we entered into a series of transactions with White Oak to support development of the White Oak longwall mining operation (now known as the Hamilton mine) including the purchase of preferred equity interests. On July 31, 2015 (\"White Oak Acquisition Date\"), we paid $50.0 million to acquire the remaining equity interest in White Oak and assumed control of the mine. Prior to the White Oak Acquisition Date, we had funded $422.6 million to White Oak under various agreements inclusive of the preferred equity interest purchases. In conjunction with the acquisition of White Oak, we assumed $93.5 million of debt which was extinguished in the fourth quarter of 2015 and replaced with a $100 million equipment sale-leaseback arrangement. For more information on this sale-leaseback arrangement, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies.\" In 2014 and 2015, we paid $48.0 million to Patriot and $11.6 million to CONSOL Energy, Inc. to acquire various assets, including certain mining equipment and reserves. We also paid $5.5 million in 2015 to acquire the remaining equity interest in MAC. For more information on our acquisitions, please read \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 3. Acquisitions.\"\nCash Flows\nCash provided by operating activities was $703.5 million in 2016 compared to $716.3 million in 2015. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in net income as adjusted for non-cash items and an increase in trade receivables during 2016 compared to a decrease in 2015. These decreases in cash provided by operating activities were offset in part by additional cash flows received from a reduction in coal inventories in 2016, a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets in 2016, lower payments made on accounts payable in 2016 as compared to 2015 and an increase in payroll and related benefits accruals in 2016 compared to a decrease in 2015.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $191.8 million in 2016 compared to $355.9 million in 2015. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to lower capital expenditures for mine infrastructure and equipment at various mines and a decrease in acquisition activity in 2016, offset in part by increased equity investments in affiliates and the acquisition of customer contracts in 2016. Reduced capital expenditures for mining equipment reflects in part deployment efforts for used mining equipment acquired through acquisitions in 2015 and continued re-deployment of equipment from our recently idled or closed mines previously discussed.\nNet cash used in financing activities was"}
