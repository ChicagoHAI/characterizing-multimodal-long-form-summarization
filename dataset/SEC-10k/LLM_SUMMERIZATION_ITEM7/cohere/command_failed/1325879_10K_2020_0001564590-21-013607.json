Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the Risk Factors\u201d section in Part 1, Item 1A of this report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are an oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company committed to delivering medicines that provide a better life for cancer patients. Our strategy is to focus our resources toward the development and commercialization of our product candidates in North America, while leveraging partnerships to support development and commercialization in other geographies. With the approval of our first commercial product, FOTIVDA\u00ae (tivozanib), in the United States, we have transitioned from a clinical development stage biopharmaceutical company to a commercial and clinical development stage biopharmaceutical company.\nOn March 10, 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved FOTIVDA in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory advanced renal cell carcinoma, or RCC, following two or more prior systemic therapies. FOTIVDA is an oral, next-generation vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, or VEGFR, tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or TKI. The approval of FOTIVDA is based on our pivotal phase 3 randomized, controlled, multi-center, open-label clinical trial comparing tivozanib to an approved therapy, Nexavar\u00ae (sorafenib), in RCC patients whose disease had relapsed or become refractory to two or three prior systemic therapies, which we refer to as the TIVO-3 trial. The approval is also supported by three additional trials in RCC and includes safety data from over 1,000 clinical trial subjects.\nWe are actively preparing for the commercial launch of FOTIVDA in the United States. Our U.S. sales force, sales training, marketing, market access and medical affairs teams as well as distribution capabilities are in place and we expect to have full promotional capabilities and FOTIVDA available to patients by March 31, 2021.\nFOTIVDA is also approved and commercialized through our development partner EUSA Pharma (UK) Limited, or EUSA, in the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain and certain other countries in their territory, for the treatment of adult patients with advanced RCC who are VEGFR pathway inhibitor-na\u00efve and are either untreated or who have failed prior therapy with interferon-alpha (IFN-a) or interleukin-2 (IL-2).\nBased on FOTIVDA's demonstrated anti-tumor activity, tolerability profile and reduction of regulatory T-cell production, we are studying FOTIVDA in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of RCC and hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC, in phase 2 clinical trials and we recently announced our entry into a collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb, or BMS, to conduct a phase 3 study of FOTIVDA in combination with OPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab), BMS's anti-PD-1 therapy, in patients with advanced relapsed or refractory RCC following prior immunotherapy exposure.\nOur pipeline of product candidates includes ficlatuzumab, a potent humanized immunoglobulin G1, or IgG1, monoclonal antibody that targets hepatocyte growth factor, or HGF. We have previously reported promising early clinical data on ficlatuzumab in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, or HNSCC, pancreatic cancer and acute myeloid leukemia, or AML. We are currently conducting a randomized phase 2 confirmatory study of ficlatuzumab for the potential treatment of HNSCC.\nOur pipeline of product candidates also includes worldwide rights to AV-380, a potent humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets growth differentiation factor 15, or GDF15. In December 2020, the FDA accepted our investigational new drug application, or IND, for AV-380 for the potential treatment of cancer cachexia, and we have initiated a phase 1 clinical trial in healthy subjects.\nOur earlier-stage pipeline under development includes AV-203 and AV-353, both as potential oncology treatments. AV-203 is a potent humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets ErbB3 (also known as HER3) to which we expect to regain worldwide rights in September 2021. AV-353 is a potent IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets the Notch 3 pathway.\nCommercial Launch\nDuring 2020 and early 2021, in preparation for the commercial launch of FOTIVDA in the United States, we:\nTable 299: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> expanded our organization with approximately 65 field-based employees, which includes approximately 50 oncology sales professionals;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 300: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> developed our commercial capabilities with implementation of systems and infrastructure to support our virtual and in person commercial sales organization, patient-focused programs and appropriate quality systems and compliance policies, systems and procedures; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 301: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> established our distribution network in order to be prepared to have full promotional capabilities and product available for sale by March 31, 2021.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Recent Events\nOn December 28, 2017, we entered into the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement, or the 2017 Loan Agreement, with Hercules Capital, Inc. and certain of its affiliates, or Hercules. On August 7, 2020, we entered into the first amendment to the 2017 Loan Agreement with Hercules, or the 2020 Loan Amendment, to provide us with additional term loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $35.0 million, or the 2020 Loan Facility, in four tranches to be used to repay in full the outstanding loans under the 2017 Loan Agreement and for general working capital purposes through the commercial launch of FOTIVDA, subject to certain terms and conditions. On February 1, 2021, we entered into the second amendment to the 2017 Loan Agreement with Hercules, or the 2021 Loan Amendment, that increases the 2020 Loan Facility from up to $35.0 million to up to $45.0 million following FDA approval of FOTIVDA. On March 11, 2021, we completed a second drawdown, in the amount of $20.0 million, under the 2020 Loan Facility that was made available in connection with the FDA approval of FOTIVDA on March 10, 2021.\nFinancial Overview\nWe do not have a history of generating operating profits and, as of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $621.2 million. We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant operating expenses for the foreseeable future as we seek to commercialize FOTIVDA in the United States and continue our planned development activities for our clinical stage assets.\nWe may require substantial additional funding to advance our pipeline of clinical stage assets, and the timing and nature of these activities will be conducted subject to the availability of sufficient financial resources. Please see Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources -Liquidity and Going Concern\u201d for a further discussion of our funding requirements.\nRevenue\nOur revenues have historically been generated primarily through collaborative research, development and commercialization agreements. Payments to us under these arrangements typically include one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront license fees; option exercise fees; funding of research and/or development efforts; milestone payments; and royalties on future product sales. In November 2017, we began earning sales royalties upon EUSA's commencement of the first commercial launch of FOTIVDA (tivozanib).\nIn the future, we may generate revenue from a combination of product sales, license fees, milestone payments and research and development payments in connection with strategic partnerships, and royalties resulting from the sales of products developed under licenses of our intellectual property. On March 10, 2021, the FDA approved FOTIVDA in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory advanced RCC following two or more prior systemic therapies. We are actively preparing for the commercial launch of FOTIVDA in the United States and we expect to make FOTIVDA available to patients by March 31, 2021. We expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year as a result of the timing and amount of license fees, research and development reimbursements, milestones, royalties and other payments received under our strategic partnerships, and the payments that we receive upon the sale of our products, to the extent any are successfully commercialized. If we or our strategic partners fail to complete the development of our product candidates in a timely manner or to obtain or maintain regulatory approval for them, our ability to generate future revenue, and our results of operations and financial position, would be materially adversely affected.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses have historically consisted of expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our product candidates. We recognize research and development expenses as they are incurred. These expenses consist primarily of:\nTable 302: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> employee-related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, stock-based compensation and research-related overhead;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 303: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> external development-related expenses, including clinical trials, preclinical studies, consultants and other outsourced services;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 304: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs of acquiring and manufacturing drug development related materials and related distribution;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 305: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs associated with our regulatory and quality assurance operations and medical affairs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 306: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> upfront license payments, milestones, sublicense fees and royalties related to in-licensed products and technology; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 307: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> allocated expenses for facilities and information technology.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses are net of amounts reimbursed under our agreements with Biodesix and AstraZeneca for their respective shares of development costs incurred by us under our joint development plans with each respective partner.\nWe anticipate that research and development expenses will increase in 2021, principally related to increases for a full year of costs for the medical affairs function in support of the commercial launch of FOTIVDA, ficlatuzumab manufacturing of clinical supply for a potential phase 3 clinical trial in HNSCC and the conduct of the phase 1 clinical trial of AV-380 for the potential treatment of cancer cachexia. These increases will be partially offset by lower costs, principally related to the TIVO-3 trial as it nears completion and costs incurred in 2020 that will not be incurred in 2021 related to the submission of our tivozanib NDA in March 2020 and related FDA review support. The timing and nature of contemplated activities in 2021 will be conducted subject to the availability of sufficient financial resources.\nCurrently, we track direct external development expenses and direct salary on a program-by-program basis and allocate general-related expenses, such as indirect compensation, benefits and consulting fees, to each program based on the personnel resources allocated to such program. Facilities, IT costs and stock-based compensation are not allocated amongst programs and are considered overhead.\nUncertainties of Estimates Related to Research and Development Expenses\nThe process of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain FDA approval for each of our product candidates is costly and time-consuming. The probability of success for each product candidate and clinical trial may be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the risk benefit profile of the product candidates' clinical activity, investment in the program, competition, manufacturing capabilities and commercial viability.\nAt this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, specific timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of our product candidates, or the period, if any, in which material net cash inflows may commence from sales of any approved products. This uncertainty is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs, including the uncertainty of:\nTable 308: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our ability to establish and maintain strategic partnerships, the terms of those strategic partnerships and the success of those strategic partnerships, if any, including the timing and amount of payments that we might receive from strategic partners;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 309: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for any product candidate;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 310: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the progress and results of our clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 311: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 312: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the emergence of competing technologies and products and other adverse market developments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 313: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property-related claims; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 314: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> additional manufacturing requirements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs a result of the uncertainties associated with developing drugs, including those discussed above, we are unable to determine the exact duration and completion costs of current or future clinical stages of our product candidates, or when, or to what extent, we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval. Development timelines, probability of success and development costs vary widely. We anticipate that we will make determinations as to which additional programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success, if any, of each product candidate, as well as ongoing assessment of each product candidate's commercial potential. We will need to raise substantial additional capital in the future in order to fund the development of our preclinical and clinical product candidates.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of compensation, benefits and travel for employees in executive, finance, legal, human resource and commercial functions. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include professional fees for audit, tax, general legal, patent legal, investor relations, commercial, consulting services and directors' fees, as well as facility and information technology-related costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses.\nWe anticipate that selling, general and administrative expenses will continue to increase significantly through the commercial launch of FOTIVDA and will remain consistent at that level in the second half of 2021, principally related to the addition of our salesforce, and continued expansion of our marketing, market access and commercial capabilities and general and administrative support. Accordingly, the timing and nature of contemplated activities in 2021 will be conducted subject to the availability of sufficient financial resources.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense consists of interest, amortization of debt discount, and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with our loans payable, and is shown net of interest income, which consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The primary objective of our investment policy is capital preservation.\nIncome Taxes\nWe generated tax losses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, and since we maintain a full valuation allowance on all of our deferred tax assets, we have recorded no income tax provision or benefit during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, the assessment of our ability to continue as a going concern, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments for changes in facts and circumstances, including those related to revenue recognition, contract research accruals, measurements of the PIPE Warrant liability, stock-based compensation, and estimates of our capital requirements over the next twelve months from the date of issuance of the annual consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. Changes in estimates are recorded or reflected in our disclosures in the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate. Our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nAs of December 31, 2020, our revenues have been generated primarily through collaborative research, development and commercialization agreements. The terms of these agreements generally contain multiple promised goods and services, which may include (i) licenses, or options to obtain licenses, to our technology, (ii) research and development activities to be performed on behalf of the collaborative partner, and (iii) in certain cases, services in connection with the manufacturing of preclinical and clinical material. Payments to us under these arrangements typically include one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront license fees; option exercise fees; funding of research and/or development efforts; milestone payments; and royalties on future product sales.\nCollaboration Arrangements Within the Scope of ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements\nWe analyze our collaboration arrangements to assess whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities and are therefore within the scope of ASC Topic 808, Collaborative Arrangements, or ASC 808. This assessment is performed throughout the life of the arrangement based on changes in the responsibilities of all parties in the arrangement.\nFor collaboration arrangements that are deemed to be within the scope of ASC 808, we first determine which elements of the collaboration are deemed to be within the scope of ASC 808 and those that are more reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and therefore within the scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606. Our policy is generally to recognize amounts received from collaborators in connection with joint operating activities that are within the scope of ASC 808 as a reduction in research and development expense.\nArrangements Within the Scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nUnder ASC 606, we recognize revenue when our customers obtain control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we determine we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that we determine are within the scope of ASC 606, we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligation(s) in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation(s) in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy our performance obligation(s). As part of the accounting for these arrangements, we must make significant judgments, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each performance obligation.\nOnce a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess the goods or services promised within the contract and determine those that are performance obligations. Arrangements that include rights to additional goods or services that are exercisable at a customer's discretion are generally considered options. We assess if these options provide a material right to the customer and if so, they are considered performance obligations. The exercise of a material right is accounted for as a contract modification for accounting purposes.\nWe assess whether each promised good or service is distinct for the purpose of identifying the performance obligations in the contract. This assessment involves subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the individual promised goods or services and whether such are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship. Promised goods and services are considered distinct provided that: (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (that is, the good or service is capable of being distinct) and (ii) the entity's promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (that is, the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract). In assessing whether a promised good or service is distinct, we consider factors such as the research, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. We also consider the intended benefit of the contract in assessing whether a promised good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. If a promised good or service is not distinct, an entity is required to combine that good or service with other promised goods or services until it identifies a bundle of goods or services that is distinct.\nThe transaction price is then determined and allocated to the identified performance obligations in proportion to their standalone selling prices, or SSP, on a relative SSP basis. SSP is determined at contract inception and is not updated to reflect changes between contract inception and when the performance obligations are satisfied. Determining the SSP for performance obligations requires significant judgment. In developing the SSP for a performance obligation, we consider applicable market conditions and relevant entity-specific factors, including factors that were contemplated in negotiating the agreement with the customer and estimated costs. We validate the SSP for performance obligations by evaluating whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine the SSP will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between multiple performance obligations.\nIf the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, we estimate the amount of consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to a customer. We determine the amount of variable consideration by using the expected value method or the most likely amount method. We include the unconstrained amount of estimated variable consideration in the transaction price. The amount included in the transaction price is constrained to the amount for which it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we re-evaluate the estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period of adjustment.\nIn determining the transaction price, we adjust consideration for the effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments provides us with a significant benefit of financing. We do not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component if the expectation at contract inception is such that the period between payment by the licensees and the transfer of the promised goods or services to the licensees will be one year or less. We assess each of our revenue generating arrangements in order to determine whether a significant financing component exists and concluded that a significant financing component does not exist in any of our arrangements.\nWe then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over time, and if over time based on the use of an output or input method.\nLicenses of Intellectual Property: The terms of our license agreements include the license of functional intellectual property, given the functionality of the intellectual property is not expected to change substantially as a result of our ongoing activities. If the license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenues from the portion of the transaction price allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the licensee and the licensee is able to use and benefit from the license. For licenses that are bundled with other promises (that is, for licenses that are not distinct from other promised goods and services in an arrangement), we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition.\nResearch and Development Funding: Arrangements that include payment for research and development services are generally considered to have variable consideration. If and when we assess the payment for these services is no longer subject to the constraint on variable consideration, the related revenue is included in the transaction price.\nMilestone Payments: At the inception of each arrangement that includes non-refundable payments for contingent milestones, including preclinical research and development, clinical development and regulatory, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being achieved and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within the control of us or the licensee, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. At the end of each reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of the achievement of contingent milestones and the likelihood of a significant reversal of such milestone revenue, and if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect collaboration and licensing revenue in the period of adjustment. This quarterly assessment may result in the recognition of revenue related to a contingent milestone payment before the milestone event has been achieved.\nRoyalties: For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied).\nThe following table summarizes the total revenues earned in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, by partner (in thousands). Refer to Note 4 Collaborations and License Agreements\u201d of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding specific details of these collaboration and license arrangements.\nTable 315: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Strategic Partner:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> KKC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EUSA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CANbridge\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccrued Expenses and Accrued Clinical Trial Costs and Contract Research Liabilities\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate accrued expenses. This process involves identifying services which have been performed on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements. Given our current business, the primary area of uncertainty concerning accruals which could have a material effect on our operating results is with respect to service fees paid to\ncontract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical drug supplies and to contract research organizations, or CROs, in connection with our clinical trials. In connection with all of the foregoing service fees, our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided. The majority of our service providers, including CROs, invoice us in arrears for services performed. In the event that we do not identify some costs which have begun to be incurred, or we under or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services in a given period, our reported expenses for such period would be understated or overstated. We currently reflect the effects of any changes in estimates based on changes in facts and circumstances directly in our operations in the period such change becomes known.\nOur arrangements with CROs in connection with clinical trials often provide for payment prior to commencing the project or based upon predetermined milestones throughout the period during which services are expected to be performed. We recognize expense relating to these arrangements based on the various services provided over the estimated time to completion. The date on which services commence, the level of services performed on or before a given date, and the cost of such services are often determined based on subjective judgments. We make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us based on the terms of the contract and our ongoing monitoring of service performance. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we had arrangements with multiple CROs whereby these organizations commit to performing services for us over multiple reporting periods. We recognize the expenses associated with these arrangements based on our expectation of the timing of the performance of components under these arrangements by these organizations. Generally, these components consist of the costs of setting up the trial, monitoring the trial, closing the trial and preparing the resulting data. Costs related to patient enrollment in clinical trials are accrued as patients are enrolled in the trial.\nWith respect to financial reporting periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the timing of our actual costs incurred have not differed materially from our estimated timing of such costs.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nRevenues\nTable 316: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2020 / 2019\nComparison\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 / 2018\nComparison\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Strategic Partner:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> KKC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (22,200\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (89\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EUSA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (576\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CANbridge\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (22,776\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (79\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur total revenues decreased by $22.8 million, or 79%, to $6.0 million in 2020 from $28.8 million in 2019, principally due to payments we earned pursuant to the amendment to the KKC Agreement for KKC's repurchase of the non-oncology rights to tivozanib in our territory, including the $25.0 million upfront payment we earned in 2019 offset by a $2.8 million development milestone we earned in 2020, as well as a $0.6 million decrease related to revenues from EUSA.\nOn August 1, 2019, we entered into an amendment to the KKC Agreement pursuant to which KKC repurchased the non-oncology rights to tivozanib in our territory, excluding the rights we have sublicensed to EUSA under the EUSA Agreement, and KKC made a $25.0 million non-refundable upfront payment to us that we received in September 2019. In the third quarter of 2019, we recognized this $25.0 million upfront payment as revenue in accordance with ASC 606. On August 2, 2020, we earned a $2.8 million development milestone payment from KKC for the acceptance of KKC's IND for a non-oncology formulation of tivozanib by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency of Japan. In the third quarter of 2020, we recognized this $2.8 million development milestone as revenue in accordance with ASC 606. Prior to the amendment to the KKC Agreement, KKC did not have any payment obligations to us for non-oncology rights to tivozanib in our territory. Refer to Note 4 Collaborations and License Agreements - In-License Agreements - Kyowa Kirin Co. (KKC)\u201d, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding the specific application of ASC 606 to our amendment to the KKC Agreement.\nNo milestone payments were earned under the CANbridge Agreement in 2020 or in 2019.\nRevenues from EUSA decreased by $0.6 million, or 15%, in 2020 as compared to 2019. In February 2019, we earned a $2.0 million milestone payment under the EUSA Agreement for reimbursement approval for FOTIVDA (tivozanib) in the first-line treatment of RCC from the Ministry of Health, Consumer Affairs and Social Welfare in Spain. In accordance with ASC 606, we recognized $1.0 million in revenue in 2019 that was not recognized in 2020. No milestone payments were earned under the EUSA Agreement in 2020. The $1.0 million decrease in milestone revenue was partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in royalty revenue from sales of FOTIVDA to $1.2 million in 2020 from $0.8 million in 2019. Refer to Note 4 Collaborations and License Agreements - Out-License Agreements - EUSA\u201d, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding the specific application of ASC 606 to our EUSA Agreement.\nOur total revenues increased by $23.4 million, or 432%, to $28.8 million in 2019 from $5.4 million in 2018, principally due to the $25.0 million upfront payment we earned from KKC under the August 1, 2019 amendment to the KKC Agreement, pursuant to which KKC repurchased the non-oncology rights to tivozanib in our territory, excluding the rights we have sublicensed to EUSA under the EUSA Agreement, partially offset by a $2.0 million development and regulatory milestone earned under the CANbridge Agreement in 2018 that was not earned in 2019.\nRevenues from KKC were $25.0 million in 2019, as discussed above, and none in 2018. No revenues were earned from KKC in 2018 as KKC did not have any payment obligations to us for non-oncology rights to tivozanib in our territory prior to the August 1, 2019 amendment to the KKC Agreement.\nRevenues from EUSA increased by $0.4 million, or 11%, in 2019 as compared to 2018. The $0.4 million increase in 2019 as compared to 2018 was principally due to the increase in royalty revenue from the sales of FOTIVDA to $0.9 million in 2019 from $0.5 million in 2018.\nRevenues from CANbridge decreased by $2.0 million, or 100%, in 2019 as compared to 2018. In the third quarter of 2018, we earned a $2.0 million development and regulatory milestone under the CANbridge Agreement for regulatory approval from the NMPA of an IND application for a clinical study of AV-203 in ESCC and recognized $2.0 million as revenue in accordance with ASC 606.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nTable 317: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2020 / 2019\nComparison\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 / 2018\nComparison\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tivozanib\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (6,101\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (33\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AV-380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (829\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (25\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ficlatuzumab\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AV-203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (670\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Overhead\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,694\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur total research and development expenses increased by $4.7 million, or 26%, to $22.7 million in 2020 from $18.0 million in 2019, principally due to an increase of $5.3 million in tivozanib-related expenses, partially offset by a decrease of $0.8 million in AV-380 related expenses. Our total research and development expenses decreased by $2.7 million, or 13%, to $18.0 million in 2019 from $20.7 million in 2018, principally due to a decrease of $6.1 million in tivozanib-related expenses, partially offset by an increase of $3.4 million in AV-380 related expense.\nTivozanib expenses increased by $5.3 million, or 44%, in 2020 as compared to 2019. The $5.3 million increase was principally due to increases totaling $7.4 million, including: (i) $3.4 million related to the tivozanib NDA for RCC, including $0.5 million related to the completion of the NDA submission and ongoing support of the FDA's review of the NDA and the $2.9 million application user fee pursuant to the PDUFA that was due upon the filing of the tivozanib NDA on March 31, 2020, (ii) $0.6 million related to the DEDUCTIVE trial that was initiated in September 2019, net of cost sharing with AstraZeneca, and (iii) $3.4 million in commercial launch-readiness initiatives incurred in 2020 that were not incurred in 2019, including $1.7 million related to the conduct of certain post-commercial launch drug supply manufacturing, $1.3 million related to the buildout of our medical affairs function and $0.4 million related to other commercial-launch readiness initiatives.\nThese increases were partially offset by decreases totaling $2.3 million, principally including: (i) $1.8 million related to lower expenses in connection with the TIVO-3 and TiNivo trials that are nearing completion and (ii) $0.5 million related to fluctuations in the year-to-year sublicense fees due to KKC in connection with a milestone we earned under our EUSA Agreement in 2019 that was not earned in 2020.\nTivozanib expenses decreased by $6.1 million, or 33%, in 2019 as compared to 2018. The $6.1 million decrease in 2019 as compared to 2018 was principally due to decreases of $4.2 million related to lower expenses in connection with the TIVO-3 and TiNivo trials as a result of a lower number of patients on treatment, $1.1 million related to commercial drug manufacturing conducted in 2018 that was not incurred in 2019, $0.6 million related to fluctuations in the year-to-year sublicense fees due to KKC in connection with milestones we earned under our EUSA Agreement and $0.7 million related to fluctuations in the year-to-year conduct of NDA submission preparation. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $0.4 million related to the commencement of the DEDUCTIVE trial in HCC in 2019, net of cost sharing with AstraZeneca.\nAV-380 expenses were $2.6 million, $3.4 million and $0 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The $0.8 million decrease in 2020 as compared to 2019 was principally due to the $2.3 million time-based milestone obligation due to St. Vincent's Hospital Sydney Limited, or St. Vincent's, under our license agreement with St. Vincent's, in the first quarter of 2019 that was not incurred in 2020, partially offset by an increase of $1.5 million related to pre-clinical development costs incurred in 2020 that were not incurred in 2019. In 2019, we incurred a total of $3.4 million in expenses, including the $2.3 million time-based milestone obligation due to St. Vincent's in January 2019 and $1.1 million of expenses related to the initiation of pre-clinical development following the return of the AV-380 program to us by Novartis International Pharmaceutical, Ltd., or Novartis. In 2018, we did not incur any AV-380 related expenses.\nFiclatuzumab expenses were flat in 2020 as compared to 2019. Ficlatuzumab expenses increased by $0.6 million, or 95%, in 2019 as compared to 2018 principally due to the commencement of the CyFi-2 trial in AML in November 2019, net of cost sharing with Biodesix. In March 2020, we decided to discontinue the CyFi-2 trial due to the urgent shift in priorities among clinical trial sites towards efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, which had impacted the trial enrollment timeline and the feasibility of completing the study within the shelf-life of the current ficlatuzumab clinical trial drug supply.\nWe did not incur any expenses related to AV-203 in 2020 or 2019. AV-203 expenses were $0.7 million in 2018 and comprised the $0.7 million sublicense fee due to Biogen in connection with the $2.0 million development and regulatory milestone we earned in the third quarter of 2018 under the CANbridge Agreement for regulatory approval from the NMPA of an IND application for a clinical study of AV-203 in ESCC. No milestones were earned nor sublicense fees incurred under the CANbridge Agreement in 2020 or 2019.\nWe anticipate that research and development expenses will increase in 2021, principally related to increases for a full year of costs for the medical affairs function in support of the commercial launch of FOTIVDA, ficlatuzumab manufacturing of the clinical supply for a potential phase 3 clinical trial in HNSCC and the conduct of the phase 1 clinical trial of AV-380 for the potential treatment of cancer cachexia. These increases will be partially offset by lower costs, principally related to the TIVO-3 trial as it nears completion and costs incurred in 2020 that will not be incurred in 2021 related to the submission of our tivozanib NDA on March 31, 2020 and related FDA review support. The timing and nature of contemplated activities in 2021 will be conducted subject to the availability of sufficient financial resources.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nTable 318: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2020 / 2019\nComparison\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 / 2018\nComparison\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $11.0 million, or 98%, to $22.2 million in 2020 from $11.2 million in 2019. The $11.0 million increase was principally due to $11.2 million in total increases, including: (i) $8.5 million in commercial launch-readiness initiatives incurred in 2020 that were not incurred in 2019, including $3.1 million in compensation costs related to the growth in our commercial infrastructure and $5.4 million related to external commercial-launch readiness activities in marketing, market access and commercial operations, (ii) $2.3 million in other professional fees, and (iii) $0.4 million in other compensation-related costs. These increases were partially offset by $0.2 million in lower facility costs resulting from our corporate headquarters move in 2020 to 30 Winter Street in Boston, Massachusetts.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $0.4 million, or 4%, to $11.2 million in 2019 from $10.8 million in 2018. The $0.4 million increase in 2019 as compared to 2018 was principally due to increases in compensation-related costs.\nWe anticipate that selling, general and administrative expenses will continue to increase significantly through the commercial launch of FOTIVDA and will remain consistent at that level in the second half of 2021, principally related to the addition of our salesforce, and continued expansion of our marketing, market access and commercial capabilities and general and administrative support. Accordingly, the timing and nature of contemplated activities in 2021 will be conducted subject to the availability of sufficient financial resources.\nSettlement Costs\nTable 319: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2020 / 2019\nComparison\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 / 2018\nComparison\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Settlement costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (667\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe did not incur any settlement costs in 2020 or 2019.

The PIPE Warrants are subject to revaluation at each balance sheet date and any changes in fair value are recorded as a non-cash gain or (loss) in our Statement of Operations as a component of other income (expense).\nIn 2020, we recorded an approximate non-cash gain of $4.9 million in our Statement of Operations attributable to the decrease in the fair value of the PIPE Warrant liability that resulted from a lower stock price of $5.77 on December 31, 2020 compared to the stock price of $6.20 on December 31, 2019, a decrease in our stock volatility rate and a shorter remaining term as the PIPE Warrants approach expiration in May 2021.\nIn 2019, we recorded an approximate non-cash gain of $11.6 million in our Statement of Operations attributable to the decrease in the fair value of the PIPE Warrant liability that principally resulted from a lower stock price of $6.20 on December 31, 2019 compared to the stock price of $16.00 on December 31, 2018.\nIn 2018, we recorded an approximate non-cash gain of $19.9 million in our Statement of Operations attributable to the decrease in the fair value of the PIPE Warrant liability that principally resulted from a lower stock price of $16.00 on December 31, 2018 compared to the stock price of $27.90 on December 31, 2017.\nOther Income (Expense)\nTable 321: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2020 / 2019\nComparison\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 / 2018\nComparison\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,300\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2020 and 2019, we did not recognize any other income or other expense. Other income (expense) was $2.3 million in 2018. In 2018, we recognized other income for the one-time payment by Novartis to us of $2.3 million in connection with the return of the AV-380 program to us. In August 2015, in connection with our AV-380 program, we entered into a license agreement with Novartis that was subsequently terminated by Novartis effective August 28, 2018. In December 2018, we entered into an agreement with\nNovartis to further establish and clarify the terms on which the AV-380 program was to be returned to us, or the AV-380 Transfer Agreement. Pursuant to the AV-380 Transfer Agreement, Novartis was obligated to make a one-time payment to us of $2.3 million. The $2.3 million payment due from Novartis was not considered a revenue transaction due to the effective termination of the Novartis Agreement on August 28, 2018 and was instead considered other income.

This decrease was principally due to the decrease in interest expense resulting from the paydown of principal under our 2017 Loan Agreement with Hercules and a lower interest rate that ranged from 9.45% to 9.65% in 2020 as compared to the interest rate that ranged from 9.70% to 10.2% in 2019. Principal payments to Hercules resumed during the period from August 1, 2019 through August 1, 2020.\nIn August 2020, we entered into the 2020 Loan Amendment with Hercules to provide us with the 2020 Loan Facility, an additional term loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to $35.0 million in four tranches to be used to refinance outstanding loans under the 2017 Loan Agreement and for general working capital purposes through the commercial launch of FOTIVDA, subject to certain terms and conditions. We received the initial $15.0 million of the 2020 Loan Facility upon the closing of the 2020 Loan Amendment, including approximately $9.7 million of which was used to retire the outstanding balance under the 2017 Loan Agreement and approximately $5.3 million of which is new loan funding. The 2020 Loan Amendment provides for an initial interest-only period effective for the period from September 1, 2020 through September 1, 2021. See Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Hercules Loan Facility\u201d below for a description of the 2017 Loan Agreement, 2020 Loan Amendment and 2020 Loan Facility.\nInterest expense, net decreased by $0.4 million, or 17%, in 2019 as compared to 2018 principally due to an increase in interest income from the investment of the higher balances of our cash equivalents and marketable securities.\nWe anticipate that interest expense, net will increase in 2021 due to the higher loan balance and interest-only period through September 1, 2021 pursuant to the 2020 Loan Amendment with Hercules, and lower investment income due to current market conditions.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nHercules Loan Facility\nOn August 7, 2020, we entered into the 2020 Loan Amendment with Hercules. The 2020 Loan Amendment provides us with the 2020 Loan Facility, an additional term loan of up to $35.0 million in four tranches to be used to refinance outstanding loans under the 2017 Loan Agreement and for general working capital purposes through the commercial launch of FOTIVDA, subject to certain terms and conditions. The 2020 Loan Facility includes (i) $15.0 million in initial funding upon execution of the 2020 Loan Amendment to retire the outstanding balance of approximately $9.7 million under the 2017 Loan Agreement and to provide approximately $5.3 million in new loan funding, and (ii) up to $20.0 million in additional loan funding following FDA approval of FOTIVDA and our net product revenues from sales of FOTIVDA, within certain time frames and subject to certain terms and conditions.\nOn February 1, 2021, we entered into the 2021 Loan Amendment with Hercules. The 2021 Loan Amendment increases the 2020 Loan Facility from up to $35.0 million to up to $45.0 million upon FDA approval of FOTIVDA. The 2021 Loan Amendment makes certain changes to the 2020 Loan Amendment, including, among other things, increasing the amount of Tranche Two funding for Performance Milestone I for FDA approval of FOTIVDA from $10.0 million to $20.0 million, thereby increasing the total amount of unfunded term loan commitments under the 2020 Loan Facility from $20.0 million to $30.0 million following FDA approval of FOTIVDA and our net product revenues from sales of FOTIVDA, within certain time frames and subject to certain terms and conditions. For more information, see Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources -Hercules Loan Facility\u201d below, as well as Note 6, -Hercules Loan Facility\u201d of the Notes to our consolidated financial statements, each included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCollaborations and License Agreements\nUnder our license agreement with KKC, we are required to pay tiered royalty payments on net sales we make of FOTIVDA in our North American territory, which range from the low to mid-teens as a percentage of net sales. We are also required to pay KKC 30% of certain amounts we receive from sublicensees, including upfront license fees, milestone payments and royalties, other than amounts we receive in respect of research and development funding or equity investments, subject to certain limitations. Also, under our license agreement with St. Vincent's, we are required to make certain milestone payments upon the earlier of the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones or a specified date for the first indication, and upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones for the second and third indications. We are also obligated to pay Biogen a percentage of milestone payments received by us from future partnerships after March 28, 2016 and single digit royalty payments on net sales related to the sale of ErbB3 products, if any, up to a cumulative maximum amount of $50.0 million. In addition, we are obligated to pay Biodesix a low double digit royalty on future product sales and 25% of future licensing revenue (excluding contributions to research and development expenses), less approximately $2.5 million that Biodesix would be required to pay to us pursuant to the October 2016 amendment to the Biodesix Agreement. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate when or if we may be required to make other additional payments to KKC, St. Vincent's, Biogen or Biodesix. For example, we are required to make future milestone payments to St. Vincent's, up to an aggregate total of $14.4 million, upon the earlier of the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones or a specified date for the first indication and second indication, and upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones for the third indication, for licensed therapeutic products, some of which payments may be increased by a mid to high double digit percentage rate for milestone payments made after we grant any sublicense under the license agreement, depending on the sublicensed territory. For more information, see Note 6, -Collaborations and License Agreements\u201d of the Notes to our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWinter Street Lease\nOn March 5, 2020, we entered into a sublease agreement for office space located at 30 Winter Street in Boston, Massachusetts (the Winter Street Sublease\u201d) to relocate our corporate headquarters located at One Broadway in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Under the terms of the Winter Street Sublease, we lease 10,158 square feet of office space for $47.00 per square foot, or approximately $0.5 million per year in base rent subject to certain operating expenses, taxes and annual base rent increases of approximately 3%. The sublease term will continue through November 29, 2022.\nOther Funding Commitments\nWe enter into contracts in the normal course of business with CROs for preclinical research studies and clinical trials. We have contracts with CROs for our TIVO-3, DEDUCTIVE and TiNivo trials, as well as our Phase 1 trial in AV-380. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice with no early termination fees. We have also entered into a contract with a third-party contract manufacturer for the manufacture of clinical drug supply for tivozanib and commercial drug supply for FOTIVDA in the United States, which includes minimum annual purchase requirements, in the approximate amount of $1.4 million for the next few years. In addition, we have entered into contracts with another contract manufacturer for the manufacture of clinical drug supply for ficlatuzumab and AV-380, for which we have manufacturing commitments in 2021, in the aggregate amount of approximately $10.3 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have financed our operations to date primarily through private placements and public offerings of our common stock and preferred stock, license fees, milestone payments and research and development funding from strategic partners, and loan proceeds. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $61.8 million. See Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources -Liquidity and Going Concern\u201d below and Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of our liquidity. Currently, our funds are invested in a United States government money market fund.

Cash used in operations was principally due to our net income (loss) adjusted for non-cash items and changes in working capital.\nOur investing activities provided cash of $17.7 million and $18.6 million in 2020 and 2018, respectively, and used cash of $17.9 million in 2019, principally due to net changes in the maturities and purchases of marketable securities.\nOur financing activities provided cash of $52.3 million, $26.2 million and $15.9 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nIn 2020, we raised approximately $52.2 million in funding, including approximately $47.7 million in net proceeds from the sale of approximately 9.7 million shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering in June 2020, approximately $5.1 million in new loan funding pursuant to the 2020 Loan Amendment with Hercules, net of transaction costs, and approximately $5.9 million in net proceeds from the sale of approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock in November 2020 pursuant to our at-the-market\u201d sales agreement with SVB Leerink LLC, or SVB Leerink, which we refer to as the SVB Leerink Sales Agreement, partially offset by approximately $6.5 million in total principal payments pursuant to a prior loan facility with Hercules from May 2010, or the 2010 Loan Agreement, during the period from January 2020 through August 2020.\nIn 2019, we raised approximately $30.3 million in net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock, including $7.5 million in net proceeds from the sale of approximately 1.3 million shares of our common stock pursuant to the SVB Leerink Sales Agreement in February 2019 and approximately $22.8 million in net proceeds from the sale of approximately 2.2 million shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 2.5 million shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering in April 2019, offset in part by approximately $4.1 million in debt-related payments pursuant to our 2010 Loan Agreement, including approximately $3.8 million in total principal payments during the period from August 2019 through December 2019 and a $0.3 million end-of-term fee in December 2019.\nIn 2018, we raised approximately $16.4 million in net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock, including approximately $5.1 million in net proceeds from an underwritten public offering of approximately 0.3 million shares of our common stock in August 2018, $10.3 million in net proceeds from the sale of approximately 0.5 million shares of our common stock pursuant to the SVB Leerink Sales Agreement in the fourth quarter of 2018 and approximately $1.0 million from the exercise of PIPE Warrants and stock options, offset in part by a $0.5 million end-of-term debt payment in January 2018 pursuant to our 2010 Loan Agreement.\nPublic Offering - June 2020\nOn June 19, 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of 9,725,000 shares of our common stock, including the partial exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase an additional 1,225,000 shares, at the public offering price of $5.25 per share for gross proceeds of approximately $51.1 million. Three stockholders each beneficially holding more than 5% of our voting securities, including an entity affiliated with New Enterprise Associates and two other stockholders purchased an aggregate of 4,503,571 shares in this offering at the same public offering price per share as the other investors. At such time, entities affiliated with New Enterprise Associates (collectively) beneficially held more than 5% of our voting securities. The net offering proceeds to us were approximately $47.7 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.\nHercules Loan Facility\nOn December 28, 2017, we entered into the 2017 Loan Agreement to refinance in full the 2010 Loan Agreement. The 2017 Loan Agreement provided for a term loan, or the 2017 Loan, subject to certain terms and conditions, in the aggregate principal amount of $20.0 million. The 2017 Loan: (i) was scheduled to mature on July 1, 2021, (ii) accrued interest at the greater of 9.45% and an amount equal to 9.45% plus the prime rate minus 4.75% (subject to a 15.0% cap), and (iii) had an interest-only period that began on the closing date of the 2017 Loan Agreement and ended on August 1, 2019, with equal installments of principal due thereafter until the maturity date.\nOn August 7, 2020, we entered into the 2020 Loan Amendment, to provide us, subject to certain terms and conditions, with additional term loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $35.0 million, or the 2020 Loan Facility, to be used to repay in full the 2017 Loan and for general working capital purposes. The 2020 Loan Facility was made available to us in four tranches, the first of which, in the amount of $15.0 million, was made available to us immediately upon the closing of the 2020 Loan Amendment. We used the $15.0 million in proceeds of the first tranche as follows: approximately $9.7 million was used to repay the outstanding balance of the 2017 Loan in full, and approximately $5.3 million was used for general working capital purposes. In connection with the 2020 Loan Amendment, we incurred approximately $0.3 million in loan issuance costs paid directly to Hercules, which are accounted for as a loan discount. The 2020 Loan Amendment was accounted for as a loan modification in accordance with ASC 470-50.\nThe remaining $20.0 million of term loans available to us under the 2020 Loan Facility subject to, among other terms and conditions, the achievement of the following milestones: (i) Tranche Two in the amount of $10.0 million, would be available through June 30, 2021 upon achieving Performance Milestone I for FDA approval of FOTIVDA, (ii) the third tranche, or Tranche Three, in the amount of $5.0 million, would be available from July 1, 2021 through January 31, 2022 if we achieve $20.0 million in net product revenues from sales of FOTIVDA, following FDA approval, by no later than December 31, 2021, or Performance Milestone II, and (iii) the fourth tranche, or Tranche Four, in the amount of $5.0 million, would be available through June 30, 2022 if we achieve both Performance Milestone I and Performance Milestone II, and if Hercules consents to the advancement of Tranche Four.\nThe 2020 Loan Amendment also amended the 2017 Loan Agreement by: (i) extending maturity of the loans from July 1, 2021 until September 1, 2023, which is extendable to September 1, 2024 upon our option if the Tranche Three funding has occurred, (ii) providing for an interest-only period beginning on the closing date of 2020 Loan Amendment and ending September 30, 2021, which period may be extended through September 30, 2022 provided we achieved Performance Milestone I, and further extendable through March 31, 2023 if the Tranche Three funding has occurred, and (iii) revising the interest rate to the greater of 9.65% and an amount equal to 9.65% plus the prime rate minus 3.25% (subject to a 15% cap). Principal payments are scheduled to commence on October 1, 2021, at the earliest, as described above. The interest rate as of December 31, 2020 was 9.65%.\nPursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement, principal will be repaid in equal monthly installments following the conclusion of the interest-only period. We may prepay all of the outstanding principal and accrued interest under the Loan Agreement, subject to a prepayment charge up to 3.0% in the first year following the closing of the 2020 Loan Amendment, decreasing to 2.0% in year two and 1.0% in year three. We are obligated to make an end-of-term payment of (i) 6.95% of the aggregate amount of loan funding received under the Loan Agreement on the earlier of the maturity of the loans or the date on which we prepay the outstanding loan balance in full, and (ii) an approximate $0.8 million payment due on the earlier of July 1, 2021 or the date on which we prepay the outstanding loan balance in full.\nThe Loan Agreement includes (i) a financial covenant that we maintain minimum unrestricted cash positions of $10.0 million through the date the Second Tranche funding is received, $15.0 million through the date the Third Tranche funding is received and $10.0 million thereafter through the maturity of the Loan Agreement, and (ii) an operating covenant that we achieve greater than or equal to 75% of our forecasted net product revenues from our sales of tivozanib over a 6-month trailing period, as defined and measured on a monthly basis, commencing upon the earlier to occur of (x) the Third Tranche funding and (y) the month of April 2022. The Loan Agreement also includes various other affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants to deliver certain financial reports; to maintain insurance coverage; and to refrain from transferring assets, incurring additional indebtedness, engaging in mergers or acquisitions, paying dividends or making other distributions, making investments, creating liens, and suffering a change in control, in each case subject to certain exceptions.\nOn February 1, 2021, we entered into the 2021 Loan Amendment. The 2021 Loan Amendment increased the aggregate principal amount of loans available under the 2020 Loan Facility from up to $35.0 million to up to $45.0 million following FDA approval of FOTIVDA. The 2021 Loan Amendment also (i) increased Tranche Two funding upon achieving Performance Milestone I from $10.0 million to $20.0 million, (ii) increased the amount of net product revenues from sales of FOTIVDA required for us to achieve Performance Milestone II from $20.0 million to $35.0 million, and changed the deadline for achieving Performance Milestone II from December 31, 2021 to April 1, 2022, and (iii) increased the amount of unrestricted cash required for us to satisfy the minimum financial covenant during the period between receiving Tranche Two funding and Tranche Three funding from $10.0 million to $15.0 million.\nOn March 11, 2021, we completed the $20.0 million drawdown of Tranche Two funding under the 2021 Loan Amendment that was made available in connection with the achievement of Performance Milestone I upon FDA approval of FOTIVDA on March 10, 2021. The achievement of Performance Milestone I extended the interest-only period by twelve months from September 30, 2021 to September 30, 2022 and increased the amount of unrestricted cash required for us to satisfy the minimum financial covenant during the period between receiving Tranche Two funding and Tranche Three funding from $10.0 million to $15.0 million.\nObligations under the Loan Agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding intellectual property. The Loan Agreement provides that certain events shall constitute a default by us, including failure by us to pay amounts under the Loan Agreement when due; breach or default in the performance of any covenant under the Loan Agreement by us, subject to certain cure periods; our insolvency and certain other bankruptcy proceedings involving us; our default of obligations involving indebtedness in excess of $500,000; and the occurrence of an event or circumstance that would have a material adverse effect upon our business.\nWe have determined that the risk of subjective acceleration under the material adverse events clause included in the Loan Agreement is remote and, therefore, have classified the outstanding principal amount in current and long-term liabilities based on the timing of scheduled principal payments. As of December 31, 2020, we are in compliance with all of the loan covenants and, through the date of this filing, the lenders have not asserted any events of default under the Loan Agreement. We do not believe that there has been a material adverse change as defined in the Loan Agreement.\nUniversal Shelf Registration Statement\nOn November 9, 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which covers the offering, issuance and sale of up to $300.0 million of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and/or units, or the 2020 Shelf. The 2020 Shelf (File No. 333-249982) was declared effective by the SEC on November 18, 2020 and was filed to replace our then existing shelf registration statement, which was terminated. As of December 31, 2020, there was approximately $268.2 million available for future issuance of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and/or units.\nPublic Offering - April 2019\nIn April 2019, we completed an underwritten public offering of 2,173,913 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 2,500,000 shares of our common stock, which we refer to herein as the Offering Warrants, including warrants to purchase an aggregate of 326,086 shares of our common stock sold pursuant to the underwriter's partial exercise of its overallotment option, at the public offering price of $11.40 per share and $0.10 per warrant for gross proceeds of approximately $25.0 million. The Offering Warrants were immediately exercisable upon issuance at an exercise price of $12.50 per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, and will expire two years from the date of issuance. Any Offering Warrants that have not been exercised for cash prior to their expiration shall be automatically exercised via cashless exercise on the expiration date. The shares and warrants were issued separately and are separately transferable. An entity affiliated with New Enterprise Associates purchased 434,782 shares and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 434,782 shares in this offering at the same public offering price per share as the other investors. At such time, entities affiliated with New Enterprise Associates (collectively) beneficially held more than 5% of our voting securities. The net offering proceeds to us were approximately $22.8 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. As of December 31, 2020, Offering Warrants to purchase 2,500,000 shares of our common stock were outstanding, at an exercise price of $12.50 per share, with an expiration date of April 8, 2021.\nIn March 2021, Offering Warrants exercisable for 247,391 shares of common stock had been exercised, for approximately $3.1 million in cash proceeds, and Offering Warrants exercisable for 2,252,609 shares of common stock were outstanding.\nSales Agreement with SVB Leerink\nIn February 2018, we entered into the SVB Leerink Sales Agreement with SVB Leerink pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock from time to time up to an aggregate amount of $50 million, at our option, through SVB Leerink as our sales agent, with any sales of common stock through SVB Leerink being made by any method that is deemed an at-the-market offering\u201d as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or in other transactions. Any such shares of common stock will be sold pursuant to a prospectus supplement filed under the 2017 Shelf, as defined below. We agreed to pay SVB Leerink a commission of up to 3% of the gross proceeds of any sales of common stock pursuant to the SVB Leerink Sales Agreement. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we sold approximately 0.5 million shares pursuant to the SVB Leerink Sales Agreement, resulting in approximately $10.3 million in proceeds, net of commissions. In February 2019, we sold approximately 1.3 million shares pursuant to the SVB Leerink Sales Agreement, resulting in proceeds of approximately $7.5 million, net of commissions. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we sold approximately 1.1 million shares as a block pursuant to the SVB Leerink Sales Agreement, resulting in proceeds of approximately $5.9 million, net of commissions. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $25.7 million was available for future issuance pursuant to the SVB Leerink Sales Agreement.\nPublic Offering - August 2018\nOn August 21, 2018, we closed an underwritten public offering of approximately 0.3 million shares of our common stock at the public offering price of $22.60 per share for gross proceeds of approximately $5.7 million. Two greater than 5% stockholders, including an entity affiliated with New Enterprise Associates and another stockholder purchased approximately 0.2 million shares in this offering at the same public offering price per share as the other investors. The net offering proceeds to us were approximately $5.1 million after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses payable by us.\nPrivate Placement / PIPE Warrants\nIn May 2016, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with a select group of qualified institutional buyers, institutional accredited investors and accredited investors pursuant to which we sold 1,764,242 units, at a price of $9.65 per unit, for gross proceeds of approximately $17.0 million. Each unit consisted of one share of our common stock and a PIPE Warrant to purchase one share of our common stock. The PIPE Warrants have an exercise price of $10.00 per share and are exercisable in any manner at any time for a period of five years from the date of issuance. Certain of our directors and executive officers purchased an aggregate of 54,402 units in this offering at the same price as the other investors. The net offering proceeds to us were approximately $15.4 million after deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses payable by us. As of December 31, 2020, PIPE Warrants exercisable for 1,683,933 shares of common stock were outstanding, at an exercise price of $10.00 per share, with an expiration date of May 16, 2021.\nLiquidity and Going Concern\nWe have devoted substantially all of our resources to our drug development efforts, comprised of research and development, manufacturing, conducting clinical trials for our product candidates, protecting our intellectual property and general and administrative functions relating to these operations. Our future success is dependent on our ability to commercialize FOTIVDA in the United States and develop our clinical stage assets and, ultimately, upon our ability to create shareholder value.\nOn March 10, 2021, the FDA approved FOTIVDA in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory advanced RCC following two or more prior systemic therapies. We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant operating expenses for the foreseeable future as we commercialize FOTIVDA in the United States and continue our planned development activities for our clinical stage assets. Our future product revenues will depend upon the size of markets in which FOTIVDA, and any future products, have received approval, and our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, reimbursement from third-party payers and adequate market share for FOTIVDA and any future products in those markets. The likelihood of our long-term success must be considered in light of the expenses, difficulties and potential delays that may be encountered in the development and commercialization of new pharmaceutical products, competitive factors in the marketplace and the complex regulatory environment in which we operate. Absent the realization of sufficient revenues from product sales to support our cost structure, we may never attain or sustain profitability. We may require substantial additional funding to advance our pipeline of clinical stage assets, and the timing and nature of these activities will be conducted subject to the availability of sufficient financial resources.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we received approximately $65.3 million in funding, including approximately $53.6 million in equity funding, approximately $5.1 million in new loan funding pursuant to the August 2020 Loan Amendment with Hercules, net of transaction costs, and approximately $6.6 million in partnership funding for cost sharing obligations, royalties from the sales of FOTIVDA by EUSA and a development milestone payment by KKC. The $53.6 million in equity finding included approximately $47.7 million in net proceeds from the sale of approximately 9.7 million shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering in June 2020 and approximately $5.9 million in net proceeds from the sale of approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock pursuant to the SVB Leerink Sales Agreement.\nWe believe that our $61.8 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020, along with proceeds from the $20.0 million drawdown under the 2020 Loan Facility in March 2021 and from warrant exercises to date, together with anticipated partnership cost sharing reimbursements, royalties from EUSA's FOTIVDA sales, product revenues upon the commercial launch of FOTIVDA in the United States and the potential additional $10.0 million in credit under the Loan Agreement, as described above in Liquidity and Capital Resources-Hercules Loan Facility\u201d, would allow us to fund our planned operations into 2022.\nThere are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products. Accordingly, our future funding requirements may vary from our current expectations and will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\nTable 324: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the cost of commercialization activities of FOTIVDA in the United States and any of our product candidates that may be approved for sale, including marketing, sales and distribution costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 325: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the cost of manufacturing FOTIVDA in the United States, our product candidates and any additional products we may successfully commercialize;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 326: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our ability to establish and maintain strategic partnerships, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 327: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the number and characteristics of the product candidates we pursue;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 328: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our product candidates, and of conducting preclinical and clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 329: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the timing of, and the costs involved in, completing our clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 330: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 331: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the absence of any breach, acceleration event or event of default under our Loan Agreement, or under any other agreements with third parties;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 332: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the cost and outcome of any legal actions against us;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 333: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties on, tivozanib and our future products, if any;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 334: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> general economic, industry and market conditions; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 335: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the impact of COVID-19 on our operations, business and prospects.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe may require substantial additional funding to advance our pipeline of clinical stage assets. We may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock or through additional credit facilities, these securities and/or the loans under credit facilities could provide for rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. Additional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. We also expect to seek additional funds through arrangements with collaborators, licensees or other third parties. These arrangements would generally require us to relinquish or encumber rights to some of our technologies or product candidates, and we may not be able to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise substantial additional funding to advance our pipeline of clinical stage assets, whether on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all or if we were to default under the Loan Agreement, and Hercules accelerated the then remaining principal payments and fees due under the loan, then we may be required to:\nTable 336: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> delay,

Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the Risk Factors\u201d section in Part 1, Item 1A of this report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are an oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company committed to delivering medicines that provide a better life for cancer patients. Our strategy is to focus our resources toward the development and commercialization of our product candidates in North America, while leveraging partnerships to support development and commercialization in other geographies. With the approval of our first commercial product, FOTIVDA\u00ae (tivozanib), in the United States, we have transitioned from a clinical development stage biopharmaceutical company to a commercial and clinical development stage biopharmaceutical company.\nOn March 10, 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved FOTIVDA in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory advanced renal cell carcinoma, or RCC, following two or more prior systemic therapies. FOTIVDA is an oral, next-generation vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, or VEGFR, tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or TKI. The approval of FOTIVDA is based on our pivotal phase 3 randomized, controlled, multi-center, open-label clinical trial comparing tivozanib to an approved therapy, Nexavar\u00ae (sorafenib), in RCC patients whose disease had relapsed or become refractory to two or three prior systemic therapies, which we refer to as the TIVO-3 trial. The approval is also supported by three additional trials in RCC and includes safety data from over 1,000 clinical trial subjects.\nWe are actively preparing for the commercial launch of FOTIVDA in the United States. Our U.S. sales force, sales training, marketing, market access and medical affairs teams as well as distribution capabilities are in place and we expect to have full promotional capabilities and FOTIVDA available to patients by March 31, 2021.\nFOTIVDA is also approved and commercialized through our development partner EUSA Pharma (UK) Limited, or EUSA, in the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain and certain other countries in their territory, for the treatment of adult patients with advanced RCC who are VEGFR pathway inhibitor-na\u00efve and are either untreated or who have failed prior therapy with interferon-alpha (IFN-a) or interleukin-2 (IL-2).\nBased on FOTIVDA's demonstrated anti-tumor activity, tolerability profile and reduction of regulatory T-cell production, we are studying FOTIVDA in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of RCC and hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC, in phase 2 clinical trials and we recently announced our entry into a collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb, or BMS, to conduct a phase 3 study of FOTIVDA in combination with OPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab), BMS's anti-PD-1 therapy, in patients with advanced relapsed or refractory RCC following prior immunotherapy exposure.\nOur pipeline of product candidates includes ficlatuzumab, a potent humanized immunoglobulin G1, or IgG1, monoclonal antibody that targets hepatocyte growth factor, or HGF. We have previously reported promising early clinical data on ficlatuzumab in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, or HNSCC, pancreatic cancer and acute myeloid leukemia, or AML. We are currently conducting a randomized phase 2 confirmatory study of ficlatuzumab for the potential treatment of HNSCC.\nOur pipeline of product candidates also includes worldwide rights to AV-380, a potent humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets growth differentiation factor 15, or GDF15. In December 2020, the FDA accepted our investigational new drug application, or IND, for AV-380 for the potential treatment of cancer cachexia, and we have initiated a phase 1 clinical trial in healthy subjects.\nOur earlier-stage pipeline under development includes AV-203 and AV-353, both as potential oncology treatments. AV-203 is a potent humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets ErbB3 (also known as HER3) to which we expect to regain worldwide rights in September 2021. AV-353 is a potent IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets the Notch 3 pathway.\nCommercial Launch\nDuring 2020 and early 2021, in preparation for the commercial launch of FOTIVDA in the United States, we:\n \u2022 expanded our organization with approximately 65 field-based employees, which includes approximately 50 oncology sales professionals; \n \u2022 developed our commercial capabilities with implementation of systems and infrastructure to support our virtual and in person commercial sales organization, patient-focused programs and appropriate quality systems and compliance policies, systems and procedures; and \n \u2022 established our distribution network in order to be prepared to have full promotional capabilities and product available for sale by March 31, 2021. \nOther Recent Events\nOn December 28, 2017, we entered into the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement, or the 2017 Loan Agreement, with Hercules Capital, Inc. and certain of its affiliates, or Hercules. On August 7, 2020, we entered into the first amendment to the 2017 Loan Agreement with Hercules, or the 2020 Loan Amendment, to provide us with additional term loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $35.0 million, or the 2020 Loan Facility, in four tranches to be used to repay in full the outstanding loans under the 2017 Loan Agreement and for general working capital purposes through the commercial launch of FOTIVDA, subject to certain terms and conditions. On February 1, 2021, we entered into the second amendment to the 2017 Loan Agreement with Hercules, or the 2021 Loan Amendment, that increases the 2020 Loan Facility from up to $35.0 million to up to $45.0 million following FDA approval of FOTIVDA. On March 11, 2021, we completed a second drawdown, in the amount of $20.0 million, under the 2020 Loan Facility that was made available in connection with the FDA approval of FOTIVDA on March 10, 2021.\nFinancial Overview\nWe do not have a history of generating operating profits and, as of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $621.2 million. We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant operating expenses for the foreseeable future as we seek to commercialize FOTIVDA in the United States and continue our planned development activities for our clinical stage assets.\nWe may require substantial additional funding to advance our pipeline of clinical stage assets, and the timing and nature of these activities will be conducted subject to the availability of sufficient financial resources. Please see Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources -Liquidity and Going Concern\u201d for a further discussion of our funding requirements.\nRevenue\nOur revenues have historically been generated primarily through collaborative research, development and commercialization agreements. Payments to us under these arrangements typically include one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront license fees; option exercise fees; funding of research and/or development efforts; milestone payments; and royalties on future product sales. In November 2017, we began earning sales royalties upon EUSA's commencement of the first commercial launch of FOTIVDA (tivozanib).\nIn the future, we may generate revenue from a combination of product sales, license fees, milestone payments and research and development payments in connection with strategic partnerships, and royalties resulting from the sales of products developed under licenses of our intellectual property. On March 10, 2021, the FDA approved FOTIVDA in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory advanced RCC following two or more prior systemic therapies. We are actively preparing for the commercial launch of FOTIVDA in the United States and we expect to make FOTIVDA available to patients by March 31, 2021. We expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year as a result of the timing and amount of license fees, research and development reimbursements, milestones, royalties and other payments received under our strategic partnerships, and the payments that we receive upon the sale of our products, to the extent any are successfully commercialized. If we or our strategic partners fail to complete the development of our product candidates in a timely manner or to obtain or maintain regulatory approval for them, our ability to generate future revenue, and our results of operations and financial position, would be materially adversely affected.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses have historically consisted of expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our product candidates. We recognize research and development expenses as they are incurred. These expenses consist primarily of:\n \u2022 employee-related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, stock-based compensation and research-related overhead; \n \u2022 external development-related expenses, including clinical trials, preclinical studies, consultants and other outsourced services; \n \u2022 costs of acquiring and manufacturing drug development related materials and related distribution; \n \u2022 costs associated with our regulatory and quality assurance operations and medical affairs; \n \u2022 upfront license payments, milestones, sublicense fees and royalties related to in-licensed products and technology; and \n \u2022 allocated expenses for facilities and information technology. \nResearch and development expenses are net of amounts reimbursed under our agreements with Biodesix and AstraZeneca for their respective shares of development costs incurred by us under our joint development plans with each respective partner.\nWe anticipate that research and development expenses will increase in 2021, principally related to increases for a full year of costs for the medical affairs function in support of the commercial launch of FOTIVDA, ficlatuzumab manufacturing of clinical supply for a potential phase 3 clinical trial in HNSCC and the conduct of the phase 1 clinical trial of AV-380 for the potential treatment of cancer cachexia. These increases will be partially offset by lower costs, principally related to the TIVO-3 trial as it nears completion and costs incurred in 2020 that will not be incurred in 2021 related to the submission of our tivozanib NDA in March 2020 and related FDA review support. The timing and nature of contemplated activities in 2021 will be conducted subject to the availability of sufficient financial resources.\nCurrently, we track direct external development expenses and direct salary on a program-by-program basis and allocate general-related expenses, such as indirect compensation, benefits and consulting fees, to each program based on the personnel resources allocated to such program. Facilities, IT costs and stock-based compensation are not allocated amongst programs and are considered overhead.\nUncertainties of Estimates Related to Research and Development Expenses\nThe process of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain FDA approval for each of our product candidates is costly and time-consuming. The probability of success for each product candidate and clinical trial may be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the risk benefit profile of the product candidates' clinical activity, investment in the program, competition, manufacturing capabilities and commercial viability.\nAt this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, specific timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of our product candidates, or the period, if any, in which material net cash inflows may commence from sales of any approved products. This uncertainty is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs, including the uncertainty of:\n \u2022 our ability to establish and maintain strategic partnerships, the terms of those strategic partnerships and the success of those strategic partnerships, if any, including the timing and amount of payments that we might receive from strategic partners; \n \u2022 the scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for any product candidate; \n \u2022 the progress and results of our clinical trials; \n \u2022 the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates; \n \u2022 the emergence of competing technologies and products and other adverse market developments; \n \u2022 the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property-related claims; and \n \u2022 additional manufacturing requirements. \nAs a result of the uncertainties associated with developing drugs, including those discussed above, we are unable to determine the exact duration and completion costs of current or future clinical stages of our product candidates, or when, or to what extent, we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval. Development timelines, probability of success and development costs vary widely. We anticipate that we will make determinations as to which additional programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success, if any, of each product candidate, as well as ongoing assessment of each product candidate's commercial potential. We will need to raise substantial additional capital in the future in order to fund the development of our preclinical and clinical product candidates.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of compensation, benefits and travel for employees in executive, finance, legal, human resource and commercial functions. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include professional fees for audit, tax, general legal, patent legal, investor relations, commercial, consulting services and directors' fees, as well as facility and information technology-related costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses.\nWe anticipate that selling, general and administrative expenses will continue to increase significantly through the commercial launch of FOTIVDA and will remain consistent at that level in the second half of 2021, principally related to the addition of our salesforce, and continued expansion of our marketing, market access and commercial capabilities and general and administrative support. Accordingly, the timing and nature of contemplated activities in 2021 will be conducted subject to the availability of sufficient financial resources.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense consists of interest, amortization of debt discount, and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with our loans payable, and is shown net of interest income, which consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The primary objective of our investment policy is capital preservation.\nIncome Taxes\nWe generated tax losses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, and since we maintain a full valuation allowance on all of our deferred tax assets, we have recorded no income tax provision or benefit during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, the assessment of our ability to continue as a going concern, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments for changes in facts and circumstances, including those related to revenue recognition, contract research accruals, measurements of the PIPE Warrant liability, stock-based compensation, and estimates of our capital requirements over the next twelve months from the date of issuance of the annual consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. Changes in estimates are recorded or reflected in our disclosures in the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate. Our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nAs of December 31, 2020, our revenues have been generated primarily through collaborative research, development and commercialization agreements. The terms of these agreements generally contain multiple promised goods and services, which may include (i) licenses, or options to obtain licenses, to our technology, (ii) research and development activities to be performed on behalf of the collaborative partner, and (iii) in certain cases, services in connection with the manufacturing of preclinical and clinical material. Payments to us under these arrangements typically include one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront license fees; option exercise fees; funding of research and/or development efforts; milestone payments; and royalties on future product sales.\nCollaboration Arrangements Within the Scope of ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements\nWe analyze our collaboration arrangements to assess whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities and are therefore within the scope of ASC Topic 808, Collaborative Arrangements, or ASC 808. This assessment is performed throughout the life of the arrangement based on changes in the responsibilities of all parties in the arrangement.\nFor collaboration arrangements that are deemed to be within the scope of ASC 808, we first determine which elements of the collaboration are deemed to be within the scope of ASC 808 and those that are more reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and therefore within the scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606. Our policy is generally to recognize amounts received from collaborators in connection with joint operating activities that are within the scope of ASC 808 as a reduction in research and development expense.\nArrangements Within the Scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nUnder ASC 606, we recognize revenue when our customers obtain control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we determine we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that we determine are within the scope of ASC 606, we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligation(s) in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation(s) in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy our performance obligation(s). As part of the accounting for these arrangements, we must make significant judgments, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each performance obligation.\nOnce a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess the goods or services promised within the contract and determine those that are performance obligations. Arrangements that include rights to additional goods or services that are exercisable at a customer's discretion are generally considered options. We assess if these options provide a material right to the customer and if so, they are considered performance obligations. The exercise of a material right is accounted for as a contract modification for accounting purposes.\nWe assess whether each promised good or service is distinct for the purpose of identifying the performance obligations in the contract. This assessment involves subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the individual promised goods or services and whether such are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship. Promised goods and services are considered distinct provided that: (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (that is, the good or service is capable of being distinct) and (ii) the entity's promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (that is, the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract). In assessing whether a promised good or service is distinct, we consider factors such as the research, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. We also consider the intended benefit of the contract in assessing whether a promised good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. If a promised good or service is not distinct, an entity is required to combine that good or service with other promised goods or services until it identifies a bundle of goods or services that is distinct.\nThe transaction price is then determined and allocated to the identified performance obligations in proportion to their standalone selling prices, or SSP, on a relative SSP basis. SSP is determined at contract inception and is not updated to reflect changes between contract inception and when the performance obligations are satisfied. Determining the SSP for performance obligations requires significant judgment. In developing the SSP for a performance obligation, we consider applicable market conditions and relevant entity-specific factors, including factors that were contemplated in negotiating the agreement with the customer and estimated costs. We validate the SSP for performance obligations by evaluating whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine the SSP will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between multiple performance obligations.\nIf the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, we estimate the amount of consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to a customer. We determine the amount of variable consideration by using the expected value method or the most likely amount method. We include the unconstrained amount of estimated variable consideration in the transaction price. The amount included in the transaction price is constrained to the amount for which it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we re-evaluate the estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period of adjustment.\nIn determining the transaction price, we adjust consideration for the effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments provides us with a significant benefit of financing. We do not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component if the expectation at contract inception is such that the period between payment by the licensees and the transfer of the promised goods or services to the licensees will be one year or less. We assess each of our revenue generating arrangements in order to determine whether a significant financing component exists and concluded that a significant financing component does not exist in any of our arrangements.\nWe then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over time, and if over time based on the use of an output or input method.\nLicenses of Intellectual Property: The terms of our license agreements include the license of functional intellectual property, given the functionality of the intellectual property is not expected to change substantially as a result of our ongoing activities. If the license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenues from the portion of the transaction price allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the licensee and the licensee is able to use and benefit from the license. For licenses that are bundled with other promises (that is, for licenses that are not distinct from other promised goods and services in an arrangement), we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition.\nResearch and Development Funding: Arrangements that include payment for research and development services are generally considered to have variable consideration. If and when we assess the payment for these services is no longer subject to the constraint on variable consideration, the related revenue is included in the transaction price.\nMilestone Payments: At the inception of each arrangement that includes non-refundable payments for contingent milestones, including preclinical research and development, clinical development and regulatory, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being achieved and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within the control of us or the licensee, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. At the end of each reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of the achievement of contingent milestones and the likelihood of a significant reversal of such milestone revenue, and if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect collaboration and licensing revenue in the period of adjustment. This quarterly assessment may result in the recognition of revenue related to a contingent milestone payment before the milestone event has been achieved.\nRoyalties: For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied).\nThe following table summarizes the total revenues earned in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, by partner (in thousands). Refer to Note 4 Collaborations and License Agreements\u201d of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding specific details of these collaboration and license arrangements.\n\nAccrued Expenses and Accrued Clinical Trial Costs and Contract Research Liabilities\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate accrued expenses. This process involves identifying services which have been performed on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements. Given our current business, the primary area of uncertainty concerning accruals which could have a material effect on our operating results is with respect to service fees paid to\ncontract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical drug supplies and to contract research organizations, or CROs, in connection with our clinical trials. In connection with all of the foregoing service fees, our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided. The majority of our service providers, including CROs, invoice us in arrears for services performed. In the event that we do not identify some costs which have begun to be incurred, or we under or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services in a given period, our reported expenses for such period would be understated or overstated. We currently reflect the effects of any changes in estimates based on changes in facts and circumstances directly in our operations in the period such change becomes known.\nOur arrangements with CROs in connection with clinical trials often provide for payment prior to commencing the project or based upon predetermined milestones throughout the period during which services are expected to be performed. We recognize expense relating to these arrangements based on the various services provided over the estimated time to completion. The date on which services commence, the level of services performed on or before a given date, and the cost of such services are often determined based on subjective judgments. We make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us based on the terms of the contract and our ongoing monitoring of service performance. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we had arrangements with multiple CROs whereby these organizations commit to performing services for us over multiple reporting periods. We recognize the expenses associated with these arrangements based on our expectation of the timing of the performance of components under these arrangements by these organizations. Generally, these components consist of the costs of setting up the trial, monitoring the trial, closing the trial and preparing the resulting data. Costs related to patient enrollment in clinical trials are accrued as patients are enrolled in the trial.\nWith respect to financial reporting periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the timing of our actual costs incurred have not differed materially from our estimated timing of such costs.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nRevenues\n\nOur total revenues decreased by $22.8 million, or 79%, to $6.0 million in 2020 from $28.8 million in 2019, principally due to payments we earned pursuant to the amendment to the KKC Agreement for KKC's repurchase of the non-oncology rights to tivozanib in our territory, including the $25.0 million upfront payment we earned in 2019 offset by a $2.8 million development milestone we earned in 2020, as well as a $0.6 million decrease related to revenues from EUSA.\nOn August 1, 2019, we entered into an amendment to the KKC Agreement pursuant to which KKC repurchased the non-oncology rights to tivozanib in our territory, excluding the rights we have sublicensed to EUSA under the EUSA Agreement, and KKC made a $25.0 million non-refundable upfront payment to us that we received in September 2019. In the third quarter of 2019, we recognized this $25.0 million upfront payment as revenue in accordance with ASC 606. On August 2, 2020, we earned a $2.8 million development milestone payment from KKC for the acceptance of KKC's IND for a non-oncology formulation of tivozanib by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency of Japan. In the third quarter of 2020, we recognized this $2.8 million development milestone as revenue in accordance with ASC 606. Prior to the amendment to the KKC Agreement, KKC did not have any payment obligations to us for non-oncology rights to tivozanib in our territory. Refer to Note 4 Collaborations and License Agreements - In-License Agreements - Kyowa Kirin Co. (KKC)\u201d, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding the specific application of ASC 606 to our amendment to the KKC Agreement.\nNo milestone payments were earned under the CANbridge Agreement in 2020 or in 2019.\nRevenues from EUSA decreased by $0.6 million, or 15%, in 2020 as compared to 2019. In February 2019, we earned a $2.0 million milestone payment under the EUSA Agreement for reimbursement approval for FOTIVDA (tivozanib) in the first-line treatment of RCC from the Ministry of Health, Consumer Affairs and Social Welfare in Spain. In accordance with ASC 606, we recognized $1.0 million in revenue in 2019 that was not recognized in 2020. No milestone payments were earned under the EUSA Agreement in 2020. The $1.0 million decrease in milestone revenue was partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in royalty revenue from sales of FOTIVDA to $1.2 million in 2020 from $0.8 million in 2019. Refer to Note 4 Collaborations and License Agreements - Out-License Agreements - EUSA\u201d, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding the specific application of ASC 606 to our EUSA Agreement.\nOur total revenues increased by $23.4 million, or 432%, to $28.8 million in 2019 from $5.4 million in 2018, principally due to the $25.0 million upfront payment we earned from KKC under the August 1, 2019 amendment to the KKC Agreement, pursuant to which KKC repurchased the non-oncology rights to tivozanib in our territory, excluding the rights we have sublicensed to EUSA under the EUSA Agreement, partially offset by a $2.0 million development and regulatory milestone earned under the CANbridge Agreement in 2018 that was not earned in 2019.\nRevenues from KKC were $25.0 million in 2019, as discussed above, and none in 2018. No revenues were earned from KKC in 2018 as KKC did not have any payment obligations to us for non-oncology rights to tivozanib in our territory prior to the August 1, 2019 amendment to the KKC Agreement.\nRevenues from EUSA increased by $0.4 million, or 11%, in 2019 as compared to 2018. The $0.4 million increase in 2019 as compared to 2018 was principally due to the increase in royalty revenue from the sales of FOTIVDA to $0.9 million in 2019 from $0.5 million in 2018.\nRevenues from CANbridge decreased by $2.0 million, or 100%, in 2019 as compared to 2018. In the third quarter of 2018, we earned a $2.0 million development and regulatory milestone under the CANbridge Agreement for regulatory approval from the NMPA of an IND application for a clinical study of AV-203 in ESCC and recognized $2.0 million as revenue in accordance with ASC 606.\nResearch and Development Expenses\n\nOur total research and development expenses increased by $4.7 million, or 26%, to $22.7 million in 2020 from $18.0 million in 2019, principally due to an increase of $5.3 million in tivozanib-related expenses, partially offset by a decrease of $0.8 million in AV-380 related expenses. Our total research and development expenses decreased by $2.7 million, or 13%, to $18.0 million in 2019 from $20.7 million in 2018, principally due to a decrease of $6.1 million in tivozanib-related expenses, partially offset by an increase of $3.4 million in AV-380 related expense.\nTivozanib expenses increased by $5.3 million, or 44%, in 2020 as compared to 2019. The $5.3 million increase was principally due to increases totaling $7.4 million, including: (i) $3.4 million related to the tivozanib NDA for RCC, including $0.5 million related to the completion of the NDA submission and ongoing support of the FDA's review of the NDA and the $2.9 million application user fee pursuant to the PDUFA that was due upon the filing of the tivozanib NDA on March 31, 2020, (ii) $0.6 million related to the DEDUCTIVE trial that was initiated in September 2019, net of cost sharing with AstraZeneca, and (iii) $3.4 million in commercial launch-readiness initiatives incurred in 2020 that were not incurred in 2019, including $1.7 million related to the conduct of certain post-commercial launch drug supply manufacturing, $1.3 million related to the buildout of our medical affairs function and $0.4 million related to other commercial-launch readiness initiatives.\nThese increases were partially offset by decreases totaling $2.3 million, principally including: (i) $1.8 million related to lower expenses in connection with the TIVO-3 and TiNivo trials that are nearing completion and (ii) $0.5 million related to fluctuations in the year-to-year sublicense fees due to KKC in connection with a milestone we earned under our EUSA Agreement in 2019 that was not earned in 2020.\nTivozanib expenses decreased by $6.1 million, or 33%, in 2019 as compared to 2018. The $6.1 million decrease in 2019 as compared to 2018 was principally due to decreases of $4.2 million related to lower expenses in connection with the TIVO-3 and TiNivo trials as a result of a lower number of patients on treatment, $1.1 million related to commercial drug manufacturing conducted in 2018 that was not incurred in 2019, $0.6 million related to fluctuations in the year-to-year sublicense fees due to KKC in connection with milestones we earned under our EUSA Agreement and $0.7 million related to fluctuations in the year-to-year conduct of NDA submission preparation. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $0.4 million related to the commencement of the DEDUCTIVE trial in HCC in 2019, net of cost sharing with AstraZeneca.\nAV-380 expenses were $2.6 million, $3.4 million and $0 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The $0.8 million decrease in 2020 as compared to 2019 was principally due to the $2.3 million time-based milestone obligation due to St. Vincent's Hospital Sydney Limited, or St. Vincent's, under our license agreement with St. Vincent's, in the first quarter of 2019 that was not incurred in 2020, partially offset by an increase of $1.5 million related to pre-clinical development costs incurred in 2020 that were not incurred in 2019. In 2019, we incurred a total of $3.4 million in expenses, including the $2.3 million time-based milestone obligation due to St. Vincent's in January 2019 and $1.1 million of expenses related to the initiation of pre-clinical development following the return of the AV-380 program to us by Novartis International Pharmaceutical, Ltd., or Novartis. In 2018, we did not incur any AV-380 related expenses.\nFiclatuzumab expenses were flat in 2020 as compared to 2019. Ficlatuzumab expenses increased by $0.6 million, or 95%, in 2019 as compared to 2018 principally due to the commencement of the CyFi-2 trial in AML in November 2019, net of cost sharing with Biodesix. In March 2020, we decided to discontinue the CyFi-2 trial due to the urgent shift in priorities among clinical trial sites towards efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, which had impacted the trial enrollment timeline and the feasibility of completing the study within the shelf-life of the current ficlatuzumab clinical trial drug supply.\nWe did not incur any expenses related to AV-203 in 2020 or 2019. AV-203 expenses were $0.7 million in 2018 and comprised the $0.7 million sublicense fee due to Biogen in connection with the $2.0 million development and regulatory milestone we earned in the third quarter of 2018 under the CANbridge Agreement for regulatory approval from the NMPA of an IND application for a clinical study of AV-203 in ESCC. No milestones were earned nor sublicense fees incurred under the CANbridge Agreement in 2020 or 2019.\nWe anticipate that research and development expenses will increase in 2021, principally related to increases for a full year of costs for the medical affairs function in support of the commercial launch of FOTIVDA, ficlatuzumab manufacturing of the clinical supply for a potential phase 3 clinical trial in HNSCC and the conduct of the phase 1 clinical trial of AV-380 for the potential treatment of cancer cachexia. These increases will be partially offset by lower costs, principally related to the TIVO-3 trial as it nears completion and costs incurred in 2020 that will not be incurred in 2021 related to the submission of our tivozanib NDA on March 31, 2020 and related FDA review support. The timing and nature of contemplated activities in 2021 will be conducted subject to the availability of sufficient financial resources.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $11.0 million, or 98%, to $22.2 million in 2020 from $11.2 million in 2019. The $11.0 million increase was principally due to $11.2 million in total increases, including: (i) $8.5 million in commercial launch-readiness initiatives incurred in 2020 that were not incurred in 2019, including $3.1 million in compensation costs related to the growth in our commercial infrastructure and $5.4 million related to external commercial-launch readiness activities in marketing, market access and commercial operations, (ii) $2.3 million in other professional fees, and (iii) $0.4 million in other compensation-related costs. These increases were partially offset by $0.2 million in lower facility costs resulting from our corporate headquarters move in 2020 to 30 Winter Street in Boston, Massachusetts.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $0.4 million, or 4%, to $11.2 million in 2019 from $10.8 million in 2018. The $0.4 million increase in 2019 as compared to 2018 was principally due to increases in compensation-related costs.\nWe anticipate that selling, general and administrative expenses will continue to increase significantly through the commercial launch of FOTIVDA and will remain consistent at that level in the second half of 2021, principally related to the addition of our salesforce, and continued expansion of our marketing, market access and commercial capabilities and general and administrative support. Accordingly, the timing and nature of contemplated activities in 2021 will be conducted subject to the availability of sufficient financial resources.\nSettlement Costs\n\nWe did not incur any settlement costs in 2020 or 2019. Settlement costs were $(0.7) million in 2018. In December 2017, we entered into a binding memorandum of understanding related to a class action settlement that included the issuance of 200,000 warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, or the Settlement Warrants. The Settlement Warrants were revalued at each balance sheet date prior to their issuance on July 16, 2018. Refer to Note 3, Significant Accounting Policies - Prior Class Action Settlement and Settlement Warrants\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChange in Fair Value of PIPE Warrant Liability\n\nIn May 2016, we issued PIPE Warrants, or the PIPE Warrants, in connection with a private placement financing and recorded the warrants as a liability. The PIPE Warrants are subject to revaluation at each balance sheet date and any changes in fair value are recorded as a non-cash gain or (loss) in our Statement of Operations as a component of other income (expense).\nIn 2020, we recorded an approximate non-cash gain of $4.9 million in our Statement of Operations attributable to the decrease in the fair value of the PIPE Warrant liability that resulted from a lower stock price of $5.77 on December 31, 2020 compared to the stock price of $6.20 on December 31, 2019, a decrease in our stock volatility rate and a shorter remaining term as the PIPE Warrants approach expiration in May 2021.\nIn 2019, we recorded an approximate non-cash gain of $11.6 million in our Statement of Operations attributable to the decrease in the fair value of the PIPE Warrant liability that principally resulted from a lower stock price of $6.20 on December 31, 2019 compared to the stock price of $16.00 on December 31, 2018.\nIn 2018, we recorded an approximate non-cash gain of $19.9 million in our Statement of Operations attributable to the decrease in the fair value of the PIPE Warrant liability that principally resulted from a lower stock price of $16.00 on December 31, 2018 compared to the stock price of $27.90 on December 31, 2017.\nOther Income (Expense)\n\nIn 2020 and 2019, we did not recognize any other income or other expense. Other income (expense) was $2.3 million in 2018. In 2018, we recognized other income for the one-time payment by Novartis to us of $2.3 million in connection with the return of the AV-380 program to us. In August 2015, in connection with our AV-380 program, we entered into a license agreement with Novartis that was subsequently terminated by Novartis effective August 28, 2018. In December 2018, we entered into an agreement with\nNovartis to further establish and clarify the terms on which the AV-380 program was to be returned to us, or the AV-380 Transfer Agreement. Pursuant to the AV-380 Transfer Agreement, Novartis was obligated to make a one-time payment to us of $2.3 million. The $2.3 million payment due from Novartis was not considered a revenue transaction due to the effective termination of the Novartis Agreement on August 28, 2018 and was instead considered other income. Refer to Note 4 Collaborations and License Agreements - Novartis\u201d, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInterest Expense, net\n\nInterest expense, net decreased by $0.2 million, or 12%, in 2020 as compared to 2019. This decrease was principally due to the decrease in interest expense resulting from the paydown of principal under our 2017 Loan Agreement with Hercules and a lower interest rate that ranged from 9.45% to 9.65% in 2020 as compared to the interest rate that ranged from 9.70% to 10.2% in 2019. Principal payments to Hercules resumed during the period from August 1, 2019 through August 1, 2020.\nIn August 2020, we entered into the 2020 Loan Amendment with Hercules to provide us with the 2020 Loan Facility, an additional term loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to $35.0 million in four tranches to be used to refinance outstanding loans under the 2017 Loan Agreement and for general working capital purposes through the commercial launch of FOTIVDA, subject to certain terms and conditions. We received the initial $15.0 million of the 2020 Loan Facility upon the closing of the 2020 Loan Amendment, including approximately $9.7 million of which was used to retire the outstanding balance under the 2017 Loan Agreement and approximately $5.3 million of which is new loan funding. The 2020 Loan Amendment provides for an initial interest-only period effective for the period from September 1, 2020 through September 1, 2021. See Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Hercules Loan Facility\u201d below for a description of the 2017 Loan Agreement, 2020 Loan Amendment and 2020 Loan Facility.\nInterest expense, net decreased by $0.4 million, or 17%, in 2019 as compared to 2018 principally due to an increase in interest income from the investment of the higher balances of our cash equivalents and marketable securities.\nWe anticipate that interest expense, net will increase in 2021 due to the higher loan balance and interest-only period through September 1, 2021 pursuant to the 2020 Loan Amendment with Hercules, and lower investment income due to current market conditions.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nHercules Loan Facility\nOn August 7, 2020, we entered into the 2020 Loan Amendment with Hercules. The 2020 Loan Amendment provides us with the 2020 Loan Facility, an additional term loan of up to $35.0 million in four tranches to be used to refinance outstanding loans under the 2017 Loan Agreement and for general working capital purposes through the commercial launch of FOTIVDA, subject to certain terms and conditions. The 2020 Loan Facility includes (i) $15.0 million in initial funding upon execution of the 2020 Loan Amendment to retire the outstanding balance of approximately $9.7 million under the 2017 Loan Agreement and to provide approximately $5.3 million in new loan funding, and (ii) up to $20.0 million in additional loan funding following FDA approval of FOTIVDA and our net product revenues from sales of FOTIVDA, within certain time frames and subject to certain terms and conditions.\nOn February 1, 2021, we entered into the 2021 Loan Amendment with Hercules. The 2021 Loan Amendment increases the 2020 Loan Facility from up to $35.0 million to up to $45.0 million upon FDA approval of FOTIVDA. The 2021 Loan Amendment makes certain changes to the 2020 Loan Amendment, including, among other things, increasing the amount of Tranche Two funding for Performance Milestone I for FDA approval of FOTIVDA from $10.0 million to $20.0 million, thereby increasing the total amount of unfunded term loan commitments under the 2020 Loan Facility from $20.0 million to $30.0 million following FDA approval of FOTIVDA and our net product revenues from sales of FOTIVDA, within certain time frames and subject to certain terms and conditions. For more information, see Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources -Hercules Loan Facility\u201d below, as well as Note 6, -Hercules Loan Facility\u201d of the Notes to our consolidated financial statements, each included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCollaborations and License Agreements\nUnder our license agreement with KKC, we are required to pay tiered royalty payments on net sales we make of FOTIVDA in our North American territory, which range from the low to mid-teens as a percentage of net sales. We are also required to pay KKC 30% of certain amounts we receive from sublicensees, including upfront license fees, milestone payments and royalties, other than amounts we receive in respect of research and development funding or equity investments, subject to certain limitations. Also, under our license agreement with St. Vincent's, we are required to make certain milestone payments upon the earlier of the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones or a specified date for the first indication, and upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones for the second and third indications. We are also obligated to pay Biogen a percentage of milestone payments received by us from future partnerships after March 28, 2016 and single digit royalty payments on net sales related to the sale of ErbB3 products, if any, up to a cumulative maximum amount of $50.0 million. In addition, we are obligated to pay Biodesix a low double digit royalty on future product sales and 25% of future licensing revenue (excluding contributions to research and development expenses), less approximately $2.5 million that Biodesix would be required to pay to us pursuant to the October 2016 amendment to the Biodesix Agreement. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate when or if we may be required to make other additional payments to KKC, St. Vincent's, Biogen or Biodesix. For example, we are required to make future milestone payments to St. Vincent's, up to an aggregate total of $14.4 million, upon the earlier of the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones or a specified date for the first indication and second indication, and upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones for the third indication, for licensed therapeutic products, some of which payments may be increased by a mid to high double digit percentage rate for milestone payments made after we grant any sublicense under the license agreement, depending on the sublicensed territory. For more information, see Note 6, -Collaborations and License Agreements\u201d of the Notes to our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWinter Street Lease\nOn March 5, 2020, we entered into a sublease agreement for office space located at 30 Winter Street in Boston, Massachusetts (the Winter Street Sublease\u201d) to relocate our corporate headquarters located at One Broadway in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Under the terms of the Winter Street Sublease, we lease 10,158 square feet of office space for $47.00 per square foot, or approximately $0.5 million per year in base rent subject to certain operating expenses, taxes and annual base rent increases of approximately 3%. The sublease term will continue through November 29, 2022.\nOther Funding Commitments\nWe enter into contracts in the normal course of business with CROs for preclinical research studies and clinical trials. We have contracts with CROs for our TIVO-3, DEDUCTIVE and TiNivo trials, as well as our Phase 1 trial in AV-380. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice with no early termination fees. We have also entered into a contract with a third-party contract manufacturer for the manufacture of clinical drug supply for tivozanib and commercial drug supply for FOTIVDA in the United States, which includes minimum annual purchase requirements, in the approximate amount of $1.4 million for the next few years. In addition, we have entered into contracts with another contract manufacturer for the manufacture of clinical drug supply for ficlatuzumab and AV-380, for which we have manufacturing commitments in 2021, in the aggregate amount of approximately $10.3 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have financed our operations to date primarily through private placements and public offerings of our common stock and preferred stock, license fees, milestone payments and research and development funding from strategic partners, and loan proceeds. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $61.8 million. See Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources -Liquidity and Going Concern\u201d below and Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of our liquidity. Currently, our funds are invested in a United States government money market fund. The following table sets forth", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the Risk Factors\u201d section in Part 1, Item 1A of this report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are an oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company committed to delivering medicines that provide a better life for cancer patients. Our strategy is to focus our resources toward the development and commercialization of our product candidates in North America, while leveraging partnerships to support development and commercialization in other geographies. With the approval of our first commercial product, FOTIVDA\u00ae (tivozanib), in the United States, we have transitioned from a clinical development stage biopharmaceutical company to a commercial and clinical development stage biopharmaceutical company.\nOn March 10, 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved FOTIVDA in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory advanced renal cell carcinoma, or RCC, following two or more prior systemic therapies. FOTIVDA is an oral, next-generation vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, or VEGFR, tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or TKI. The approval of FOTIVDA is based on our pivotal phase 3 randomized, controlled, multi-center, open-label clinical trial comparing tivozanib to an approved therapy, Nexavar\u00ae (sorafenib), in RCC patients whose disease had relapsed or become refractory to two or three prior systemic therapies, which we refer to as the TIVO-3 trial. The approval is also supported by three additional trials in RCC and includes safety data from over 1,000 clinical trial subjects.\nWe are actively preparing for the commercial launch of FOTIVDA in the United States. Our U.S. sales force, sales training, marketing, market access and medical affairs teams as well as distribution capabilities are in place and we expect to have full promotional capabilities and FOTIVDA available to patients by March 31, 2021.\nFOTIVDA is also approved and commercialized through our development partner EUSA Pharma (UK) Limited, or EUSA, in the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain and certain other countries in their territory, for the treatment of adult patients with advanced RCC who are VEGFR pathway inhibitor-na\u00efve and are either untreated or who have failed prior therapy with interferon-alpha (IFN-a) or interleukin-2 (IL-2).\nBased on FOTIVDA's demonstrated anti-tumor activity, tolerability profile and reduction of regulatory T-cell production, we are studying FOTIVDA in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of RCC and hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC, in phase 2 clinical trials and we recently announced our entry into a collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb, or BMS, to conduct a phase 3 study of FOTIVDA in combination with OPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab), BMS's anti-PD-1 therapy, in patients with advanced relapsed or refractory RCC following prior immunotherapy exposure.\nOur pipeline of product candidates includes ficlatuzumab, a potent humanized immunoglobulin G1, or IgG1, monoclonal antibody that targets hepatocyte growth factor, or HGF. We have previously reported promising early clinical data on ficlatuzumab in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, or HNSCC, pancreatic cancer and acute myeloid leukemia, or AML. We are currently conducting a randomized phase 2 confirmatory study of ficlatuzumab for the potential treatment of HNSCC.\nOur pipeline of product candidates also includes worldwide rights to AV-380, a potent humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets growth differentiation factor 15, or GDF15. In December 2020, the FDA accepted our investigational new drug application, or IND, for AV-380 for the potential treatment of cancer cachexia, and we have initiated a phase 1 clinical trial in healthy subjects.\nOur earlier-stage pipeline under development includes AV-203 and AV-353, both as potential oncology treatments. AV-203 is a potent humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets ErbB3 (also known as HER3) to which we expect to regain worldwide rights in September 2021. AV-353 is a potent IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets the Notch 3 pathway.\nCommercial Launch\nDuring 2020 and early 2021, in preparation for the commercial launch of FOTIVDA in the United States, we:\n \u2022 expanded our organization with approximately 65 field-based employees, which includes approximately 50 oncology sales professionals; \n \u2022 developed our commercial capabilities with implementation of systems and infrastructure to support our virtual and in person commercial sales organization, patient-focused programs and appropriate quality systems and compliance policies, systems and procedures; and \n \u2022 established our distribution network in order to be prepared to have full promotional capabilities and product available for sale by March 31, 2021. \nOther Recent Events\nOn December 28, 2017, we entered into the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement, or the 2017 Loan Agreement, with Hercules Capital, Inc. and certain of its affiliates, or Hercules. On August 7, 2020, we entered into the first amendment to the 2017 Loan Agreement with Hercules, or the 2020 Loan Amendment, to provide us with additional term loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $35.0 million, or the 2020 Loan Facility, in four tranches to be used to repay in full the outstanding loans under the 2017 Loan Agreement and for general working capital purposes through the commercial launch of FOTIVDA, subject to certain terms and conditions. On February 1, 2021, we entered into the second amendment to the 2017 Loan Agreement with Hercules, or the 2021 Loan Amendment, that increases the 2020 Loan Facility from up to $35.0 million to up to $45.0 million following FDA approval of FOTIVDA. On March 11, 2021, we completed a second drawdown, in the amount of $20.0 million, under the 2020 Loan Facility that was made available in connection with the FDA approval of FOTIVDA on March 10, 2021.\nFinancial Overview\nWe do not have a history of generating operating profits and, as of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $621.2 million. We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant operating expenses for the foreseeable future as we seek to commercialize FOTIVDA in the United States and continue our planned development activities for our clinical stage assets.\nWe may require substantial additional funding to advance our pipeline of clinical stage assets, and the timing and nature of these activities will be conducted subject to the availability of sufficient financial resources. Please see Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources -Liquidity and Going Concern\u201d for a further discussion of our funding requirements.\nRevenue\nOur revenues have historically been generated primarily through collaborative research, development and commercialization agreements. Payments to us under these arrangements typically include one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront license fees; option exercise fees; funding of research and/or development efforts; milestone payments; and royalties on future product sales. In November 2017, we began earning sales royalties upon EUSA's commencement of the first commercial launch of FOTIVDA (tivozanib).\nIn the future, we may generate revenue from a combination of product sales, license fees, milestone payments and research and development payments in connection with strategic partnerships, and royalties resulting from the sales of products developed under licenses of our intellectual property. On March 10, 2021, the FDA approved FOTIVDA in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory advanced RCC following two or more prior systemic therapies. We are actively preparing for the commercial launch of FOTIVDA in the United States and we expect to make FOTIVDA available to patients by March 31, 2021. We expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year as a result of the timing and amount of license fees, research and development reimbursements, milestones, royalties and other payments received under our strategic partnerships, and the payments that we receive upon the sale of our products, to the extent any are successfully commercialized. If we or our strategic partners fail to complete the development of our product candidates in a timely manner or to obtain or maintain regulatory approval for them, our ability to generate future revenue, and our results of operations and financial position, would be materially adversely affected.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses have historically consisted of expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our product candidates. We recognize research and development expenses as they are incurred. These expenses consist primarily of:\n \u2022 employee-related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, stock-based compensation and research-related overhead; \n \u2022 external development-related expenses, including clinical trials, preclinical studies, consultants and other outsourced services; \n \u2022 costs of acquiring and manufacturing drug development related materials and related distribution; \n \u2022 costs associated with our regulatory and quality assurance operations and medical affairs; \n \u2022 upfront license payments, milestones, sublicense fees and royalties related to in-licensed products and technology; and \n \u2022 allocated expenses for facilities and information technology. \nResearch and development expenses are net of amounts reimbursed under our agreements with Biodesix and AstraZeneca for their respective shares of development costs incurred by us under our joint development plans with each respective partner.\nWe anticipate that research and development expenses will increase in 2021, principally related to increases for a full year of costs for the medical affairs function in support of the commercial launch of FOTIVDA, ficlatuzumab manufacturing of clinical supply for a potential phase 3 clinical trial in HNSCC and the conduct of the phase 1 clinical trial of AV-380 for the potential treatment of cancer cachexia. These increases will be partially offset by lower costs, principally related to the TIVO-3 trial as it nears completion and costs incurred in 2020 that will not be incurred in 2021 related to the submission of our tivozanib NDA in March 2020 and related FDA review support. The timing and nature of contemplated activities in 2021 will be conducted subject to the availability of sufficient financial resources.\nCurrently, we track direct external development expenses and direct salary on a program-by-program basis and allocate general-related expenses, such as indirect compensation, benefits and consulting fees, to each program based on the personnel resources allocated to such program. Facilities, IT costs and stock-based compensation are not allocated amongst programs and are considered overhead.\nUncertainties of Estimates Related to Research and Development Expenses\nThe process of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain FDA approval for each of our product candidates is costly and time-consuming. The probability of success for each product candidate and clinical trial may be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the risk benefit profile of the product candidates' clinical activity, investment in the program, competition, manufacturing capabilities and commercial viability.\nAt this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, specific timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of our product candidates, or the period, if any, in which material net cash inflows may commence from sales of any approved products. This uncertainty is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs, including the uncertainty of:\n \u2022 our ability to establish and maintain strategic partnerships, the terms of those strategic partnerships and the success of those strategic partnerships, if any, including the timing and amount of payments that we might receive from strategic partners; \n \u2022 the scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for any product candidate; \n \u2022 the progress and results of our clinical trials; \n \u2022 the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates; \n \u2022 the emergence of competing technologies and products and other adverse market developments; \n \u2022 the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property-related claims; and \n \u2022 additional manufacturing requirements. \nAs a result of the uncertainties associated with developing drugs, including those discussed above, we are unable to determine the exact duration and completion costs of current or future clinical stages of our product candidates, or when, or to what extent, we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval. Development timelines, probability of success and development costs vary widely. We anticipate that we will make determinations as to which additional programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success, if any, of each product candidate, as well as ongoing assessment of each product candidate's commercial potential. We will need to raise substantial additional capital in the future in order to fund the development of our preclinical and clinical product candidates.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of compensation, benefits and travel for employees in executive, finance, legal, human resource and commercial functions. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include professional fees for audit, tax, general legal, patent legal, investor relations, commercial, consulting services and directors' fees, as well as facility and information technology-related costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses.\nWe anticipate that selling, general and administrative expenses will continue to increase significantly through the commercial launch of FOTIVDA and will remain consistent at that level in the second half of 2021, principally related to the addition of our salesforce, and continued expansion of our marketing, market access and commercial capabilities and general and administrative support. Accordingly, the timing and nature of contemplated activities in 2021 will be conducted subject to the availability of sufficient financial resources.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense consists of interest, amortization of debt discount, and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with our loans payable, and is shown net of interest income, which consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The primary objective of our investment policy is capital preservation.\nIncome Taxes\nWe generated tax losses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, and since we maintain a full valuation allowance on all of our deferred tax assets, we have recorded no income tax provision or benefit during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, the assessment of our ability to continue as a going concern, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments for changes in facts and circumstances, including those related to revenue recognition, contract research accruals, measurements of the PIPE Warrant liability, stock-based compensation, and estimates of our capital requirements over the next twelve months from the date of issuance of the annual consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. Changes in estimates are recorded or reflected in our disclosures in the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate. Our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nAs of December 31, 2020, our revenues have been generated primarily through collaborative research, development and commercialization agreements. The terms of these agreements generally contain multiple promised goods and services, which may include (i) licenses, or options to obtain licenses, to our technology, (ii) research and development activities to be performed on behalf of the collaborative partner, and (iii) in certain cases, services in connection with the manufacturing of preclinical and clinical material. Payments to us under these arrangements typically include one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront license fees; option exercise fees; funding of research and/or development efforts; milestone payments; and royalties on future product sales.\nCollaboration Arrangements Within the Scope of ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements\nWe analyze our collaboration arrangements to assess whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities and are therefore within the scope of ASC Topic 808, Collaborative Arrangements, or ASC 808. This assessment is performed throughout the life of the arrangement based on changes in the responsibilities of all parties in the arrangement.\nFor collaboration arrangements that are deemed to be within the scope of ASC 808, we first determine which elements of the collaboration are deemed to be within the scope of ASC 808 and those that are more reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and therefore within the scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606. Our policy is generally to recognize amounts received from collaborators in connection with joint operating activities that are within the scope of ASC 808 as a reduction in research and development expense.\nArrangements Within the Scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nUnder ASC 606, we recognize revenue when our customers obtain control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we determine we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that we determine are within the scope of ASC 606, we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligation(s) in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation(s) in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy our performance obligation(s). As part of the accounting for these arrangements, we must make significant judgments, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each performance obligation.\nOnce a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess the goods or services promised within the contract and determine those that are performance obligations. Arrangements that include rights to additional goods or services that are exercisable at a customer's discretion are generally considered options. We assess if these options provide a material right to the customer and if so, they are considered performance obligations. The exercise of a material right is accounted for as a contract modification for accounting purposes.\nWe assess whether each promised good or service is distinct for the purpose of identifying the performance obligations in the contract. This assessment involves subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the individual promised goods or services and whether such are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship. Promised goods and services are considered distinct provided that: (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (that is, the good or service is capable of being distinct) and (ii) the entity's promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (that is, the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract). In assessing whether a promised good or service is distinct, we consider factors such as the research, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. We also consider the intended benefit of the contract in assessing whether a promised good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. If a promised good or service is not distinct, an entity is required to combine that good or service with other promised goods or services until it identifies a bundle of goods or services that is distinct.\nThe transaction price is then determined and allocated to the identified performance obligations in proportion to their standalone selling prices, or SSP, on a relative SSP basis. SSP is determined at contract inception and is not updated to reflect changes between contract inception and when the performance obligations are satisfied. Determining the SSP for performance obligations requires significant judgment. In developing the SSP for a performance obligation, we consider applicable market conditions and relevant entity-specific factors, including factors that were contemplated in negotiating the agreement with the customer and estimated costs. We validate the SSP for performance obligations by evaluating whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine the SSP will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between multiple performance obligations.\nIf the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, we estimate the amount of consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to a customer. We determine the amount of variable consideration by using the expected value method or the most likely amount method. We include the unconstrained amount of estimated variable consideration in the transaction price. The amount included in the transaction price is constrained to the amount for which it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we re-evaluate the estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period of adjustment.\nIn determining the transaction price, we adjust consideration for the effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments provides us with a significant benefit of financing. We do not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component if the expectation at contract inception is such that the period between payment by the licensees and the transfer of the promised goods or services to the licensees will be one year or less. We assess each of our revenue generating arrangements in order to determine whether a significant financing component exists and concluded that a significant financing component does not exist in any of our arrangements.\nWe then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over time, and if over time based on the use of an output or input method.\nLicenses of Intellectual Property: The terms of our license agreements include the license of functional intellectual property, given the functionality of the intellectual property is not expected to change substantially as a result of our ongoing activities. If the license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenues from the portion of the transaction price allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the licensee and the licensee is able to use and benefit from the license. For licenses that are bundled with other promises (that is, for licenses that are not distinct from other promised goods and services in an arrangement), we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition.\nResearch and Development Funding: Arrangements that include payment for research and development services are generally considered to have variable consideration. If and when we assess the payment for these services is no longer subject to the constraint on variable consideration, the related revenue is included in the transaction price.\nMilestone Payments: At the inception of each arrangement that includes non-refundable payments for contingent milestones, including preclinical research and development, clinical development and regulatory, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being achieved and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within the control of us or the licensee, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. At the end of each reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of the achievement of contingent milestones and the likelihood of a significant reversal of such milestone revenue, and if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect collaboration and licensing revenue in the period of adjustment. This quarterly assessment may result in the recognition of revenue related to a contingent milestone payment before the milestone event has been achieved.\nRoyalties: For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied).\nThe following table summarizes the total revenues earned in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, by partner (in thousands). Refer to Note 4 Collaborations and License Agreements\u201d of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding specific details of these collaboration and license arrangements.\nTable 315: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Strategic Partner:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> KKC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EUSA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CANbridge\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccrued Expenses and Accrued Clinical Trial Costs and Contract Research Liabilities\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate accrued expenses. This process involves identifying services which have been performed on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements. Given our current business, the primary area of uncertainty concerning accruals which could have a material effect on our operating results is with respect to service fees paid to\ncontract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical drug supplies and to contract research organizations, or CROs, in connection with our clinical trials. In connection with all of the foregoing service fees, our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided. The majority of our service providers, including CROs, invoice us in arrears for services performed. In the event that we do not identify some costs which have begun to be incurred, or we under or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services in a given period, our reported expenses for such period would be understated or overstated. We currently reflect the effects of any changes in estimates based on changes in facts and circumstances directly in our operations in the period such change becomes known.\nOur arrangements with CROs in connection with clinical trials often provide for payment prior to commencing the project or based upon predetermined milestones throughout the period during which services are expected to be performed. We recognize expense relating to these arrangements based on the various services provided over the estimated time to completion. The date on which services commence, the level of services performed on or before a given date, and the cost of such services are often determined based on subjective judgments. We make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us based on the terms of the contract and our ongoing monitoring of service performance. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we had arrangements with multiple CROs whereby these organizations commit to performing services for us over multiple reporting periods. We recognize the expenses associated with these arrangements based on our expectation of the timing of the performance of components under these arrangements by these organizations. Generally, these components consist of the costs of setting up the trial, monitoring the trial, closing the trial and preparing the resulting data. Costs related to patient enrollment in clinical trials are accrued as patients are enrolled in the trial.\nWith respect to financial reporting periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the timing of our actual costs incurred have not differed materially from our estimated timing of such costs.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nRevenues\nTable 316: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2020 / 2019\nComparison\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 / 2018\nComparison\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Strategic Partner:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> KKC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (22,200\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (89\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EUSA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (576\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CANbridge\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (22,776\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (79\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur total revenues decreased by $22.8 million, or 79%, to $6.0 million in 2020 from $28.8 million in 2019, principally due to payments we earned pursuant to the amendment to the KKC Agreement for KKC's repurchase of the non-oncology rights to tivozanib in our territory, including the $25.0 million upfront payment we earned in 2019 offset by a $2.8 million development milestone we earned in 2020, as well as a $0.6 million decrease related to revenues from EUSA.\nOn August 1, 2019, we entered into an amendment to the KKC Agreement pursuant to which KKC repurchased the non-oncology rights to tivozanib in our territory, excluding the rights we have sublicensed to EUSA under the EUSA Agreement, and KKC made a $25.0 million non-refundable upfront payment to us that we received in September 2019. In the third quarter of 2019, we recognized this $25.0 million upfront payment as revenue in accordance with ASC 606. On August 2, 2020, we earned a $2.8 million development milestone payment from KKC for the acceptance of KKC's IND for a non-oncology formulation of tivozanib by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency of Japan. In the third quarter of 2020, we recognized this $2.8 million development milestone as revenue in accordance with ASC 606. Prior to the amendment to the KKC Agreement, KKC did not have any payment obligations to us for non-oncology rights to tivozanib in our territory. Refer to Note 4 Collaborations and License Agreements - In-License Agreements - Kyowa Kirin Co. (KKC)\u201d, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding the specific application of ASC 606 to our amendment to the KKC Agreement.\nNo milestone payments were earned under the CANbridge Agreement in 2020 or in 2019.\nRevenues from EUSA decreased by $0.6 million, or 15%, in 2020 as compared to 2019. In February 2019, we earned a $2.0 million milestone payment under the EUSA Agreement for reimbursement approval for FOTIVDA (tivozanib) in the first-line treatment of RCC from the Ministry of Health, Consumer Affairs and Social Welfare in Spain. In accordance with ASC 606, we recognized $1.0 million in revenue in 2019 that was not recognized in 2020. No milestone payments were earned under the EUSA Agreement in 2020. The $1.0 million decrease in milestone revenue was partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in royalty revenue from sales of FOTIVDA to $1.2 million in 2020 from $0.8 million in 2019. Refer to Note 4 Collaborations and License Agreements - Out-License Agreements - EUSA\u201d, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding the specific application of ASC 606 to our EUSA Agreement.\nOur total revenues increased by $23.4 million, or 432%, to $28.8 million in 2019 from $5.4 million in 2018, principally due to the $25.0 million upfront payment we earned from KKC under the August 1, 2019 amendment to the KKC Agreement, pursuant to which KKC repurchased the non-oncology rights to tivozanib in our territory, excluding the rights we have sublicensed to EUSA under the EUSA Agreement, partially offset by a $2.0 million development and regulatory milestone earned under the CANbridge Agreement in 2018 that was not earned in 2019.\nRevenues from KKC were $25.0 million in 2019, as discussed above, and none in 2018. No revenues were earned from KKC in 2018 as KKC did not have any payment obligations to us for non-oncology rights to tivozanib in our territory prior to the August 1, 2019 amendment to the KKC Agreement.\nRevenues from EUSA increased by $0.4 million, or 11%, in 2019 as compared to 2018. The $0.4 million increase in 2019 as compared to 2018 was principally due to the increase in royalty revenue from the sales of FOTIVDA to $0.9 million in 2019 from $0.5 million in 2018.\nRevenues from CANbridge decreased by $2.0 million, or 100%, in 2019 as compared to 2018. In the third quarter of 2018, we earned a $2.0 million development and regulatory milestone under the CANbridge Agreement for regulatory approval from the NMPA of an IND application for a clinical study of AV-203 in ESCC and recognized $2.0 million as revenue in accordance with ASC 606.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nTable 317: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2020 / 2019\nComparison\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 / 2018\nComparison\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tivozanib\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (6,101\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (33\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AV-380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (829\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (25\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ficlatuzumab\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AV-203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (670\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Overhead\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,694\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur total research and development expenses increased by $4.7 million, or 26%, to $22.7 million in 2020 from $18.0 million in 2019, principally due to an increase of $5.3 million in tivozanib-related expenses, partially offset by a decrease of $0.8 million in AV-380 related expenses. Our total research and development expenses decreased by $2.7 million, or 13%, to $18.0 million in 2019 from $20.7 million in 2018, principally due to a decrease of $6.1 million in tivozanib-related expenses, partially offset by an increase of $3.4 million in AV-380 related expense.\nTivozanib expenses increased by $5.3 million, or 44%, in 2020 as compared to 2019. The $5.3 million increase was principally due to increases totaling $7.4 million, including: (i) $3.4 million related to the tivozanib NDA for RCC, including $0.5 million related to the completion of the NDA submission and ongoing support of the FDA's review of the NDA and the $2.9 million application user fee pursuant to the PDUFA that was due upon the filing of the tivozanib NDA on March 31, 2020, (ii) $0.6 million related to the DEDUCTIVE trial that was initiated in September 2019, net of cost sharing with AstraZeneca, and (iii) $3.4 million in commercial launch-readiness initiatives incurred in 2020 that were not incurred in 2019, including $1.7 million related to the conduct of certain post-commercial launch drug supply manufacturing, $1.3 million related to the buildout of our medical affairs function and $0.4 million related to other commercial-launch readiness initiatives.\nThese increases were partially offset by decreases totaling $2.3 million, principally including: (i) $1.8 million related to lower expenses in connection with the TIVO-3 and TiNivo trials that are nearing completion and (ii) $0.5 million related to fluctuations in the year-to-year sublicense fees due to KKC in connection with a milestone we earned under our EUSA Agreement in 2019 that was not earned in 2020.\nTivozanib expenses decreased by $6.1 million, or 33%, in 2019 as compared to 2018. The $6.1 million decrease in 2019 as compared to 2018 was principally due to decreases of $4.2 million related to lower expenses in connection with the TIVO-3 and TiNivo trials as a result of a lower number of patients on treatment, $1.1 million related to commercial drug manufacturing conducted in 2018 that was not incurred in 2019, $0.6 million related to fluctuations in the year-to-year sublicense fees due to KKC in connection with milestones we earned under our EUSA Agreement and $0.7 million related to fluctuations in the year-to-year conduct of NDA submission preparation. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $0.4 million related to the commencement of the DEDUCTIVE trial in HCC in 2019, net of cost sharing with AstraZeneca.\nAV-380 expenses were $2.6 million, $3.4 million and $0 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The $0.8 million decrease in 2020 as compared to 2019 was principally due to the $2.3 million time-based milestone obligation due to St. Vincent's Hospital Sydney Limited, or St. Vincent's, under our license agreement with St. Vincent's, in the first quarter of 2019 that was not incurred in 2020, partially offset by an increase of $1.5 million related to pre-clinical development costs incurred in 2020 that were not incurred in 2019. In 2019, we incurred a total of $3.4 million in expenses, including the $2.3 million time-based milestone obligation due to St. Vincent's in January 2019 and $1.1 million of expenses related to the initiation of pre-clinical development following the return of the AV-380 program to us by Novartis International Pharmaceutical, Ltd., or Novartis. In 2018, we did not incur any AV-380 related expenses.\nFiclatuzumab expenses were flat in 2020 as compared to 2019. Ficlatuzumab expenses increased by $0.6 million, or 95%, in 2019 as compared to 2018 principally due to the commencement of the CyFi-2 trial in AML in November 2019, net of cost sharing with Biodesix. In March 2020, we decided to discontinue the CyFi-2 trial due to the urgent shift in priorities among clinical trial sites towards efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, which had impacted the trial enrollment timeline and the feasibility of completing the study within the shelf-life of the current ficlatuzumab clinical trial drug supply.\nWe did not incur any expenses related to AV-203 in 2020 or 2019. AV-203 expenses were $0.7 million in 2018 and comprised the $0.7 million sublicense fee due to Biogen in connection with the $2.0 million development and regulatory milestone we earned in the third quarter of 2018 under the CANbridge Agreement for regulatory approval from the NMPA of an IND application for a clinical study of AV-203 in ESCC. No milestones were earned nor sublicense fees incurred under the CANbridge Agreement in 2020 or 2019.\nWe anticipate that research and development expenses will increase in 2021, principally related to increases for a full year of costs for the medical affairs function in support of the commercial launch of FOTIVDA, ficlatuzumab manufacturing of the clinical supply for a potential phase 3 clinical trial in HNSCC and the conduct of the phase 1 clinical trial of AV-380 for the potential treatment of cancer cachexia. These increases will be partially offset by lower costs, principally related to the TIVO-3 trial as it nears completion and costs incurred in 2020 that will not be incurred in 2021 related to the submission of our tivozanib NDA on March 31, 2020 and related FDA review support. The timing and nature of contemplated activities in 2021 will be conducted subject to the availability of sufficient financial resources.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nTable 318: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2020 / 2019\nComparison\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 / 2018\nComparison\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $11.0 million, or 98%, to $22.2 million in 2020 from $11.2 million in 2019. The $11.0 million increase was principally due to $11.2 million in total increases, including: (i) $8.5 million in commercial launch-readiness initiatives incurred in 2020 that were not incurred in 2019, including $3.1 million in compensation costs related to the growth in our commercial infrastructure and $5.4 million related to external commercial-launch readiness activities in marketing, market access and commercial operations, (ii) $2.3 million in other professional fees, and (iii) $0.4 million in other compensation-related costs. These increases were partially offset by $0.2 million in lower facility costs resulting from our corporate headquarters move in 2020 to 30 Winter Street in Boston, Massachusetts.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $0.4 million, or 4%, to $11.2 million in 2019 from $10.8 million in 2018. The $0.4 million increase in 2019 as compared to 2018 was principally due to increases in compensation-related costs.\nWe anticipate that selling, general and administrative expenses will continue to increase significantly through the commercial launch of FOTIVDA and will remain consistent at that level in the second half of 2021, principally related to the addition of our salesforce, and continued expansion of our marketing, market access and commercial capabilities and general and administrative support. Accordingly, the timing and nature of contemplated activities in 2021 will be conducted subject to the availability of sufficient financial resources.\nSettlement Costs\nTable 319: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2020 / 2019\nComparison\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 / 2018\nComparison\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Settlement costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (667\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe did not incur any settlement costs in 2020 or 2019.

In August 2015, in connection with our AV-380 program, we entered into a license agreement with Novartis that was subsequently terminated by Novartis effective August 28, 2018. In December 2018, we entered into an agreement with\nNovartis to further establish and clarify the terms on which the AV-380 program was to be returned to us, or the AV-380 Transfer Agreement. Pursuant to the AV-380 Transfer Agreement, Novartis was obligated to make a one-time payment to us of $2.3 million. The $2.3 million payment due from Novartis was not considered a revenue transaction due to the effective termination of the Novartis Agreement on August 28, 2018 and was instead considered other income.

This decrease was principally due to the decrease in interest expense resulting from the paydown of principal under our 2017 Loan Agreement with Hercules and a lower interest rate that ranged from 9.45% to 9.65% in 2020 as compared to the interest rate that ranged from 9.70% to 10.2% in 2019. Principal payments to Hercules resumed during the period from August 1, 2019 through August 1, 2020.\nIn August 2020, we entered into the 2020 Loan Amendment with Hercules to provide us with the 2020 Loan Facility, an additional term loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to $35.0 million in four tranches to be used to refinance outstanding loans under the 2017 Loan Agreement and for general working capital purposes through the commercial launch of FOTIVDA, subject to certain terms and conditions. We received the initial $15.0 million of the 2020 Loan Facility upon the closing of the 2020 Loan Amendment, including approximately $9.7 million of which was used to retire the outstanding balance under the 2017 Loan Agreement and approximately $5.3 million of which is new loan funding. The 2020 Loan Amendment provides for an initial interest-only period effective for the period from September 1, 2020 through September 1, 2021. See Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Hercules Loan Facility\u201d below for a description of the 2017 Loan Agreement, 2020 Loan Amendment and 2020 Loan Facility.\nInterest expense, net decreased by $0.4 million, or 17%, in 2019 as compared to 2018 principally due to an increase in interest income from the investment of the higher balances of our cash equivalents and marketable securities.\nWe anticipate that interest expense, net will increase in 2021 due to the higher loan balance and interest-only period through September 1, 2021 pursuant to the 2020 Loan Amendment with Hercules, and lower investment income due to current market conditions.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nHercules Loan Facility\nOn August 7, 2020, we entered into the 2020 Loan Amendment with Hercules. The 2020 Loan Amendment provides us with the 2020 Loan Facility, an additional term loan of up to $35.0 million in four tranches to be used to refinance outstanding loans under the 2017 Loan Agreement and for general working capital purposes through the commercial launch of FOTIVDA, subject to certain terms and conditions. The 2020 Loan Facility includes (i) $15.0 million in initial funding upon execution of the 2020 Loan Amendment to retire the outstanding balance of approximately $9.7 million under the 2017 Loan Agreement and to provide approximately $5.3 million in new loan funding, and (ii) up to $20.0 million in additional loan funding following FDA approval of FOTIVDA and our net product revenues from sales of FOTIVDA, within certain time frames and subject to certain terms and conditions.\nOn February 1, 2021, we entered into the 2021 Loan Amendment with Hercules. The 2021 Loan Amendment increases the 2020 Loan Facility from up to $35.0 million to up to $45.0 million upon FDA approval of FOTIVDA. The 2021 Loan Amendment makes certain changes to the 2020 Loan Amendment, including, among other things, increasing the amount of Tranche Two funding for Performance Milestone I for FDA approval of FOTIVDA from $10.0 million to $20.0 million, thereby increasing the total amount of unfunded term loan commitments under the 2020 Loan Facility from $20.0 million to $30.0 million following FDA approval of FOTIVDA and our net product revenues from sales of FOTIVDA, within certain time frames and subject to certain terms and conditions.

We are also required to pay KKC 30% of certain amounts we receive from sublicensees, including upfront license fees, milestone payments and royalties, other than amounts we receive in respect of research and development funding or equity investments, subject to certain limitations. Also, under our license agreement with St. Vincent's, we are required to make certain milestone payments upon the earlier of the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones or a specified date for the first indication, and upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones for the second and third indications. We are also obligated to pay Biogen a percentage of milestone payments received by us from future partnerships after March 28, 2016 and single digit royalty payments on net sales related to the sale of ErbB3 products, if any, up to a cumulative maximum amount of $50.0 million. In addition, we are obligated to pay Biodesix a low double digit royalty on future product sales and 25% of future licensing revenue (excluding contributions to research and development expenses), less approximately $2.5 million that Biodesix would be required to pay to us pursuant to the October 2016 amendment to the Biodesix Agreement. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate when or if we may be required to make other additional payments to KKC, St. Vincent's, Biogen or Biodesix. For example, we are required to make future milestone payments to St. Vincent's, up to an aggregate total of $14.4 million, upon the earlier of the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones or a specified date for the first indication and second indication, and upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones for the third indication, for licensed therapeutic products, some of which payments may be increased by a mid to high double digit percentage rate for milestone payments made after we grant any sublicense under the license agreement, depending on the sublicensed territory. For more information, see Note 6, -Collaborations and License Agreements\u201d of the Notes to our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWinter Street Lease\nOn March 5, 2020, we entered into a sublease agreement for office space located at 30 Winter Street in Boston, Massachusetts (the Winter Street Sublease\u201d) to relocate our corporate headquarters located at One Broadway in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Under the terms of the Winter Street Sublease, we lease 10,158 square feet of office space for $47.00 per square foot, or approximately $0.5 million per year in base rent subject to certain operating expenses, taxes and annual base rent increases of approximately 3%. The sublease term will continue through November 29, 2022.\nOther Funding Commitments\nWe enter into contracts in the normal course of business with CROs for preclinical research studies and clinical trials. We have contracts with CROs for our TIVO-3, DEDUCTIVE and TiNivo trials, as well as our Phase 1 trial in AV-380. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice with no early termination fees. We have also entered into a contract with a third-party contract manufacturer for the manufacture of clinical drug supply for tivozanib and commercial drug supply for FOTIVDA in the United States, which includes minimum annual purchase requirements, in the approximate amount of $1.4 million for the next few years. In addition, we have entered into contracts with another contract manufacturer for the manufacture of clinical drug supply for ficlatuzumab and AV-380, for which we have manufacturing commitments in 2021, in the aggregate amount of approximately $10.3 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have financed our operations to date primarily through private placements and public offerings of our common stock and preferred stock, license fees, milestone payments and research and development funding from strategic partners, and loan proceeds. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $61.8 million. See Part II, Item 7.
