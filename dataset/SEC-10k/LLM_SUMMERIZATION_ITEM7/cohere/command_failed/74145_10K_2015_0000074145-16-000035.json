Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIntroduction\nOG&E generates, transmits, distributes and sells electric energy in Oklahoma and western Arkansas. Its operations are subject to regulation by the OCC, the APSC and the FERC. OG&E was incorporated in 1902 under the laws of the Oklahoma Territory. OG&E is the largest electric utility in Oklahoma and its franchised service territory includes Fort Smith, Arkansas and the surrounding communities. OG&E sold its retail natural gas business in 1928 and is no longer engaged in the natural gas distribution business. OG&E is a wholly-owned subsidiary of OGE Energy, an energy and energy services provider offering physical delivery and related services for both electricity and natural gas primarily in the south central United States.\nOverview\nOG&E Mission and Focus\nOGE Energy's mission, through OG&E and its equity interest in Enable, is to fulfill its critical role in the nation's electric utility and natural gas midstream pipeline infrastructure and meet individual customers' needs for energy and related services focusing on safety, efficiency, reliability, customer service and risk management.\nOG&E is focused on:\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Providing exceptional customer experiences by continuing to improve customer interfaces, tools, products and services that deliver high customer satisfaction and operating productivity.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Providing safe, reliable energy to the communities and customers we serve.

OG&E reported net income of $268.9 million and $292.0 million, respectively, in 2015 and 2014, a decrease of $23.1 million, or 7.9 percent, primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense due to additional assets being placed in service in 2015, and a decrease in gross margin related to milder weather and decreased wholesale transmission revenues. Partially offsetting these items was an increase in customer growth, an increase in other income and an increase in allowance for equity funds used during construction.\n2014 compared to 2013. OG&E reported net income of $292.0 million and $292.6 million, respectively, in 2014 and 2013, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 0.2 percent, reflecting an increase in depreciation expense due to additional assets being placed in service in 2014, a decrease in gross margin related to milder weather compared to 2013, an increase in other operation and maintenance expense and an increase in interest expense related to the issuance of debt. Partially offsetting these items was an increase in wholesale transmission revenues, an increase in customer growth and a decrease in incentive compensation.\n2016 Outlook\nOG&E projects to earn approximately $288 million to $300 million or $1.44 to $1.50 per average diluted share in 2016 and is based on the following assumptions:\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>normal weather patterns are experienced for the remainder of the year;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>new rates take effect in Oklahoma in mid 2016;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>gross margin on revenues of approximately $1.405 billion to $1.415 billion based on sales growth of approximately one percent on a weather-adjusted basis;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>approximately $106 million of gross margin is primarily attributed to regionally allocated transmission projects;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>operating expenses of approximately $885 million to $895 million, with operation and maintenance expenses comprising 54 percent of the total;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>interest expense of approximately $140 million which assumes a $8 million allowance for borrowed funds used during construction reduction to interest expense;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>other income of approximately $27 million including approximately $15 million of allowance for equity funds used during construction; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an effective tax rate of approximately 28 percent.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOG&E has significant seasonality in its earnings. OG&E typically shows minimal earnings in the first and fourth quarters with a majority of earnings in the third quarter due to the seasonal nature of air conditioning demand.\nGross margin is defined by OG&E as operating revenues less fuel, purchased power and certain transmission expenses. Gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes depreciation and amortization, and other operation and maintenance expenses. Expenses for fuel and purchased power are recovered through fuel adjustment clauses and as a result changes in these expenses are offset in operating revenues with no impact on net income. OG&E believes gross margin provides a more meaningful basis for evaluating its operations across periods than operating revenues because gross margin excludes the revenue effect of fluctuations in these expenses. Gross margin is used internally to measure performance against budget and in reports for management and the Board of Directors. OG&E's definition of gross margin may be different from similar terms used by other companies.\nReconciliation of gross margin to revenue:\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in Millions)\n</td> <td>2016\n(A)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales\n</td> <td>752\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross Margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(A)\n</td> <td>Based on the midpoint of OG&E earnings guidance for 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis presents factors that affected OG&E's results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 and OG&E's financial position at December 31, 2015 and 2014.

Fuel expense was $458.5 million in 2015 as compared to $627.5 million in 2014, a decrease of $169.0 million, or 26.9 percent, primarily due to lower natural gas prices offset by higher natural gas used. In 2015, OG&E's fuel mix was 49 percent coal, 44 percent natural gas and seven percent wind. In 2014, OG&E's fuel mix was 61 percent coal, 32 percent natural gas and seven percent wind. Purchased power costs were $362.6 million in 2015 as compared to $444.1 million in 2014, a decrease of $81.5 million, or 18.4 percent, primarily due to a decrease in purchases from the SPP, reflecting the impact of OG&E's participation in the SPP Integrated Marketplace, which began on March 1, 2014. Transmission related charges were $43.9 million in 2015 as compared to $35.0 million in 2014, an increase of $8.9 million, or 25.4 percent, primarily due to higher SPP charges for the base plan projects of other utilities.\nThe actual cost of fuel used in electric generation and certain purchased power costs are passed through to OG&E's customers through fuel adjustment clauses. The fuel adjustment clauses are subject to periodic review by the OCC, the APSC and the FERC. The OCC, the APSC and the FERC have authority to review the appropriateness of gas transportation charges or other fees OG&E pays to its affiliate, Enable.\nOperating Expenses\nOther operation and maintenance expenses were $444.5 million in 2015 as compared to $453.2 million in 2014, a decrease of $8.7 million, or 1.9 percent.

Allowance for equity funds used during construction was $8.3 million in 2015 as compared to $4.2 million in 2014, an increase of $4.1 million, or 97.6 percent, primarily due to higher construction work in progress balances resulting from increased spending for environmental projects.\nOther Income. Other income was $13.3 million in 2015 as compared to $4.8 million in 2014, an increase of $8.5 million, primarily due to increased guaranteed flat bill margins and an increase in the tax gross up related to higher allowance for funds used during construction.\nIncome Tax Expense. Income tax expense was $104.8 million in 2015 as compared to $111.6 million in 2014, a decrease of $6.8 million, or 6.1 percent, primarily due to lower pretax income partially offset by a reduction in Federal tax credits.\n2014 compared to 2013. OG&E's net income decreased $0.6 million, or 0.2 percent, in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to higher gross margin, which was almost offset by higher other operations and maintenance expense, higher depreciation and amortization expense, and interest expense.\nGross Margin\nOperating revenues were $2,453.1 million in 2014 as compared to $2,262.2 million in 2013, an increase of $190.9 million, or 8.4 percent. Cost of sales were $1,106.6 million in 2014 as compared to $965.9 million in 2013, an increase of $140.7 million, or 14.6 percent. Gross margin was $1,346.5 million in 2014 as compared to $1,296.3 million in 2013, an increase of $50.2 million, or 3.9 percent.

Fuel expense was $627.5 million in 2014 as compared to $672.7 million in 2013, a decrease of $45.2 million, or 6.7 percent, primarily due to lower natural gas used offset by higher natural gas prices. In 2014, OG&E's fuel mix was 61 percent coal, 32 percent natural gas and seven percent wind. In 2013, OG&E's fuel mix was 53 percent coal, 40 percent natural gas and seven percent wind. Purchased power costs were $444.1 million in 2014 as compared to $267.6 million in 2013, an increase of $176.5 million, or 66 percent, primarily due to an increase in purchases from the SPP, reflecting the impact of OG&E's participation in the SPP Integrated Marketplace, which began on March 1, 2014. Transmission related charges were $35.0 million in 2014 as compared to $25.6 million in 2013, an increase of $9.4 million, or 36.7 percent, primarily due to higher SPP charges for the base plan projects of other utilities.\nOperating Expenses\nOther operation and maintenance expenses were $453.2 million in 2014 as compared to $438.8 million in 2013, an increase of $14.4 million, or 3.3 percent. The below factors contributed to the change in other operations and maintenance expense:\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reduction in capitalized labor (A)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate overhead and allocations (B)\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract professional services (primarily marketing services)\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ongoing maintenance at power plants\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other marketing, sales and commercial (C)\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Software expense (D)\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fees, permits and licenses (E)\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vegetation management (F)\n</td> <td>(4.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee benefits (G)\n</td> <td>(4.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries and wages (H)\n</td> <td>(5.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in other operation and maintenance expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(A)\n</td> <td>Portion of labor costs capitalized into projects decreased as a result of less work performed on storm restoration.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(B)\n</td> <td>Increased primarily due to higher allocated costs from the holding company resulting from the formation of Enable during 2013.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(C)\n</td> <td>Increased primarily due to demand side management customer payments which are recovered through a rider partially offset by a reduction in media services expense.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(D)\n</td> <td>Increased as a result of higher expenditures related to Smart Grid software.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(E)\n</td> <td>Increased primarily due to higher SPP administration and assessment fees.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(F)\n</td> <td>Decreased primarily due to increased spending on system hardening in 2013 which includes costs that are being recovered through a rider.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(G)\n</td> <td>Decreased primarily due to lower pension expense, postretirement and other benefits.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(H)\n</td> <td>Decreased primarily due to incentive compensation and lower overtime wages partially offset by higher regular salaries and wages.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $270.8 million in 2014 as compared to $248.4 million in 2013, an increase of $22.4 million, or nine percent, primarily due to additional transmission assets being placed in service throughout 2013 and 2014, along with an increase resulting from the amortization of the deferred pension credits regulatory liability which was fully amortized in July 2014. These were offset by the pension regulatory asset which was fully amortized in July 2013.\nAdditional Information\nAllowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction. Allowance for equity funds used during construction was $4.2 million in 2014 as compared to $6.6 million in 2013, a decrease of $2.4 million or 36.4 percent, primarily due to lower construction work in progress balances resulting from transmission projects being placed in service in 2014.\nOther Income. Other income was $4.8 million in 2014 as compared to $8.1 million in 2013, a decrease of $3.3 million or 40.7 percent, primarily due to decreased margins recognized in the guaranteed flat bill program during 2014 as a result of cooler weather in the first quarter as compared to the same period in 2013 along with a decrease in the tax gross up related to the allowance for equity funds used during construction.\nOther Expense. Other expense was $1.9 million in 2014 as compared to $4.6 million in 2013, a decrease of $2.7 million or 58.7 percent, primarily due to decreased charitable donations during 2014.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense was $141.5 million in 2014 as compared to $129.3 million in 2013, an increase of $12.2 million, or 9.4 percent, primarily due to a $9.1 million increase in interest on long-term debt related to a $250.0 million debt issuance that occurred in May 2013, a $250.0 million debt issuance that occurred in March 2014 and an additional $250.0 million debt issuance that occurred in December 2014 partially offset by the early redemption of $140.0 million senior notes in August 2014. In addition, there was a $2.0 million increase reflecting a reduction in 2013 interest expense related to tax matters offset by a decrease in the allowance for borrowed funds used during construction of $1.0 million.\nIncome Tax Expense. Income tax expense was $111.6 million in 2014 as compared to $113.5 million in 2013, a decrease of $1.9 million, or 1.7 percent. The reduction reflects lower pretax income partially offset by a reduction in state tax credits recognized during the year and an increase in Federal credits recognized.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangement\nRailcar Lease Agreement\nOG&E has several noncancellable operating leases with purchase options, covering approximately 1,400 rotary gondola railcars to transport coal from Wyoming to OG&E's coal-fired generation units. Rental payments are charged to fuel expense and are recovered through OG&E's tariffs and fuel adjustment clauses.\nOn January 11, 2012, OG&E executed a five-year lease agreement for 135 railcars to replace railcars that have been taken out of service or destroyed.\nOn October 14, 2014, OG&E signed a separate three-year lease effective December 2014 for 131 railcars to replace railcars that have been taken out of service or destroyed.\nOn December 17, 2015, OG&E renewed the lease agreement effective February 1, 2016. At the end of the new lease term, which is February 1, 2019, OG&E has the option to either purchase the railcars at a stipulated fair market value or renew the lease. If OG&E chooses not to purchase the railcars or renew the lease agreement and the actual fair value of the railcars is less than the stipulated fair market value, OG&E would be responsible for the difference in those values up to a maximum of $20.1 million. OG&E is also required to maintain all of the railcars it has under the operating lease and has entered into an agreement with a non-affiliated company to furnish this maintenance.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWorking Capital\nWorking capital is defined as the difference in current assets and current liabilities. OG&E's working capital requirements are driven generally by changes in accounts receivable, accounts payable, commodity prices, credit extended to, and the timing of collections from, customers, the level and timing of spending for maintenance and expansion activity, inventory levels and fuel recoveries.\nAdvances to Parent. The balance of Advances to Parent was $333.6 million and $215.6 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $118.0 million, or 54.7 percent, primarily due to an over recovery of fuel costs, which will be refunded to OG&E's customers.\nAccounts Receivable and Accrued Unbilled Revenues. The balance of Accounts Receivable and Accrued Unbilled Revenues was $226.6 million and $244.3 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $17.7 million, or 7.2 percent, primarily due to a decrease in billings to OG&E's retail customers.\nFuel Inventories. The balance of Fuel Inventories was $113.8 million and $58.5 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $55.3 million, or 94.5 percent, primarily due to higher coal inventory balances at OG&E's coal fired plants resulting from lower participation in the SPP Integrated Marketplace.\nDeferred Income Taxes. Deferred Income Tax assets had no balance as of December 31, 2015 compared to $170.8 million at December 31, 2014, due to a reclassification of the balance to Non-Current Deferred Income Taxes pursuant to early adoption of ASU 2015-17 Income Taxes (Topic 740)\u201d.\nFuel Clause Recoveries. The Fuel Clause balance moved from an under recovery position of $68.3 million as of December 31, 2014 to an over recovery balance of $61.3 million as of December 31, 2015, primarily due to higher amounts billed to OG&E retail customers as compared to the actual cost of fuel and purchased power. The fuel recovery clauses are designed to smooth the impact of fuel price volatility on customers' bills. As a result, OG&E under recovers fuel costs when the actual fuel and purchased power cost recoveries exceed fuel adjustment clause recoveries and over recovers fuel costs when the actual fuel and purchased power costs are below the fuel adjustment clause recoveries. Provisions in the fuel clauses are intended to allow OG&E to amortize under and over recovery balances into future cost recoveries.\nAccounts Payable. The balance of Accounts Payable was $238.2 million and $163.3 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $74.9 million, or 45.9 percent, primarily due to storm accruals and timing of vendor payments partially offset by a decrease of fuel and purchased power expense.\nLong-Term Debt Due Within One Year. The balance of Long-Term Debt Due Within One Year was $110.0 million at December 31, 2015 compared to no balance at December 31, 2014, due to the reclassification of long-term debt that will mature in January 2016.\nCash Flows\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>2014 vs. 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31 (In millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided from operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>770.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>587.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>545.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>182.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(549.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(564.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(796.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>15.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>232.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided from financing activities\n</td> <td>(221.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(23.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>251.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(198.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(274.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Greater than a 100 percent variance.\nOperating Activities\nThe increase of $182.8 million, or 31.1 percent, in net cash provided from operating activities in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to an increase in cash received from fuel recoveries and a decrease in payments to vendors.\nThe increase of $42.6 million, or 7.8 percent, in net cash provided from operating activities in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to:\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the absence of fuel refunds to customers during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, partially offset by fuel under recoveries in the same period; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table> \u2022an increase in cash received during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 from transmission revenue.\nThese increases were partially offset by an increase in amounts paid to vendors.\nInvesting Activities\nThe decrease of $15.7 million, or 2.8 percent, in net cash used in investing activities in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures related to transmission projects partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures related to environmental projects.\nThe decrease of $232.1 million, or 29.1 percent, in net cash used in investing activities in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to lower levels of capital expenditures due to a decrease in transmission projects.\nFinancing Activities\nThe increase of $198.5 million in net cash used in financing activities in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to the issuance of long-term debt during 2014 partially offset by:\n\u2022the payment of $140.0 million in long-term debt during 2014;\n\u2022an increase in net advances with OGE Energy during 2015; and\n\u2022a decrease in dividend payments in 2015.\nThe increase of $274.7 million in net cash used in financing activities in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to:\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a decrease in net advances with OGE Energy during 2014\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the payment of $140.0 million in long-term debt; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an increase in dividend payments in 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese increases were partially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of long-term debt.\nFuture Capital Requirements and Financing Activities\nOG&E's primary needs for capital are related to acquiring or constructing new facilities and replacing or expanding existing facilities. Other working capital requirements are expected to be primarily related to maturing debt, operating lease obligations, fuel clause under and over recoveries and other general corporate purposes. OG&E generally meets its cash needs through a combination of cash generated from operations, short-term borrowings (through a combination of bank borrowings, commercial paper and borrowings from OGE Energy) and permanent financings.\nCapital Expenditures\nOG&E's estimates of capital expenditures for the years 2016 through 2020 are shown in the following table. These capital expenditures represent the base maintenance capital expenditures (i.e., capital expenditures to maintain and operate OG&E's business) plus capital expenditures for known and committed projects.\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Base Transmission\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Base Distribution\n</td> <td>190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Base Generation\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Base Transmission, Distribution, Generation and Other\n</td> <td>340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>305\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Known and Committed Projects:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transmission Projects:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Regionally Allocated Projects (A)\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Large SPP Integrated Transmission Projects (B) (C)\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Transmission Projects\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Projects:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental - low NOX burners (D)\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental - dry scrubbers (D)\n</td> <td>150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combustion turbines - Mustang\n</td> <td>180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental - natural gas conversion (D)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Other Projects\n</td> <td>350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Known and Committed Projects\n</td> <td>420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>325\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(A)\n</td> <td>Typically 100kV to 299kV projects.

On February 12, 2016, OG&E filed an application requesting the OCC to issue an order approving the\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\ninstallation of dry scrubbers at the Sooner facility, on or before May 2, 2016. The application states that if the application is not approved by May 2, 2016, OG&E will decide at that time whether to cancel the dry scrubber equipment and installation contracts and make plans to convert the Sooner coal units to natural gas. As of December 31, 2015, OG&E had incurred $94.8 million of construction work in progress on the dry scrubbers. OG&E estimates another $35.0 million of in-process expenditures will be incurred prior to May 1, 2016. Additionally, if the request is not approved, OG&E expects to seek recovery in subsequent proceedings for the expenditures incurred for the dry scrubber project and reasonable stranded costs associated with the discontinuance of the Sooner coal units. The capital costs in the table above do not reflect any actions or costs that may be incurred (including the conversion of the Sooner coal units) if the May 2, 2016 application is not approved.\nAdditional capital expenditures beyond those identified in the table above, including additional incremental growth opportunities in electric transmission assets, will be evaluated based upon their impact upon achieving OG&E's financial objectives.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes OG&E's contractual obligations at December 31, 2015. See OG&E's Statements of Capitalization and Note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements for additional information.\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2017-2018\n</td> <td>2019-2020\n</td> <td>After 2020\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maturities of long-term debt (A)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>375.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>250.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,929.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,665.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Railcars\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wind farm land leases\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other purchase obligations and commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cogeneration capacity and fixed operation and maintenance payments\n</td> <td>79.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>151.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>451.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected cogeneration energy payments\n</td> <td>58.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>389.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum fuel purchase commitments\n</td> <td>299.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>168.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>479.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected wind purchase commitments\n</td> <td>58.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>632.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>919.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term service agreement commitments\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>137.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>191.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mustang Modernization expenditures\n</td> <td>103.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental compliance plan expenditures\n</td> <td>150.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>170.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>325.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other purchase obligations and commitments\n</td> <td>752.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>780.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>367.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>990.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,890.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>869.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,166.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>646.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,966.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,648.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amounts recoverable through fuel adjustment clause (B)\n</td> <td>(420.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(387.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(259.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(753.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1,821.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>448.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>778.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>386.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,213.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,827.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(A)\n</td> <td>Maturities of OG&E's long-term debt during the next five years consist of $110.2 million, $125.2 million, $250.1 million, $250.1 million and $0.1 million in years 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(B)\n</td> <td>Includes expected recoveries of costs incurred for OG&E's railcar operating lease obligations, OG&E's expected cogeneration energy payments, OG&E's minimum fuel purchase commitments and OG&E's expected wind purchase commitments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOG&E also has 440 MWs of QF contracts to meet its current and future expected customer needs. OG&E will continue reviewing all of the supply alternatives to these QF contracts that minimize the total cost of generation to its customers, including exercising its options (if applicable) to extend these QF contracts at pre-determined rates.\nThe actual cost of fuel used in electric generation (which includes the operating lease obligations for OG&E's railcar leases shown above) and certain purchased power costs are passed through to OG&E's customers through fuel adjustment clauses. Accordingly, while the cost of fuel related to operating leases and the vast majority of minimum fuel purchase commitments of OG&E noted above may increase capital requirements, such costs are recoverable through fuel adjustment clauses and have little, if any, impact on net capital requirements and future contractual obligations. The fuel adjustment clauses are subject to periodic review by the OCC, the APSC and the FERC.\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nAt December 31, 2015, 35.5 percent of the Pension Plan investments were in listed common stocks with the balance primarily invested in U.S. Government securities, bonds, debentures and notes, and a commingled fund as presented in Note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements. In 2015, asset losses on the Pension Plan were 3.9 percent due to the losses in fixed income and equity investments. During the same time, corporate bond yields, which are used in determining the discount rate for future pension obligations, decreased. The level of funding is dependent on returns on plan assets and future discount rates. During 2015 and 2014, OGE Energy did not make any contributions to its Pension Plan. OGE Energy has not determined whether it will need to make any contributions to the Pension Plan in 2016. OGE Energy could be required to make additional contributions if the value of its pension trust and postretirement benefit plan trust assets are adversely impacted by a major market disruption in the future.\nThe following table presents the status of OG&E's portion of OGE Energy's Pension Plan, the Restoration of Retirement Income Plan and the postretirement benefit plans at December 31, 2015 and 2014. These amounts have been recorded in Accrued Benefit Obligations with the offset recorded as a regulatory asset in OG&E's Balance Sheet as discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements. The regulatory asset represents a net periodic benefit cost to be recognized in the Statements of Income in future periods.\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Pension Plan\n</td> <td>Restoration of Retirement\nIncome Plan\n</td> <td>Postretirement\nBenefit Plans\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31 (In millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefit obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>514.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>543.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>176.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>217.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value of plan assets\n</td> <td>464.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>532.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funded status at end of year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(50.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(126.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(163.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 715, \"Compensation - Retirement Benefits,\" a one-time settlement charge is required to be recorded by an organization when lump sum payments or other settlements that relieve the organization from the responsibility for the pension benefit obligation during a plan year exceed the service cost and interest cost components of the organization's net periodic pension cost. During 2015, OG&E experienced an increase in both the number of employees electing to retire and the amount of lump sum payments to be paid to such employees upon retirement. As a result, OG&E recorded pension settlement charges of $10.0 million in the third quarter and $5.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, of which $14.0 million related to OG&E's Oklahoma jurisdiction and has been included in the pension tracker. The pension settlement charge did not require a cash outlay by OG&E and did not increase OG&E's total pension expense over time, as the charges were an acceleration of costs that otherwise would be recognized as pension expense in future periods.\nSecurity Ratings\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Moody's Investors Services\n</td> <td>Standard & Poor's Ratings Services\n</td> <td>Fitch Ratings\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Notes\n</td> <td>A1\n</td> <td>A-\n</td> <td>A+\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccess to reasonably priced capital is dependent in part on credit and security ratings. Generally, lower ratings lead to higher financing costs. Pricing grids associated with OGE Energy's and OG&E's credit facilities could cause annual fees and borrowing rates to increase if an adverse rating impact occurs. The impact of any future downgrade could include an increase in the costs of OGE Energy's and OG&E's short-term borrowings, but a reduction in OGE Energy's and OG&E's credit ratings would not result in any defaults or accelerations. Any future downgrade of OGE Energy or OG&E could also lead to higher long-term borrowing costs and, if below investment grade, would require OG&E to post collateral or letters of credit.\nA security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Such rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the credit rating agency and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nFuture financing requirements may be dependent, to varying degrees, upon numerous factors such as general economic conditions, abnormal weather, load growth, commodity prices, acquisitions of other businesses and/or development of projects, actions by rating agencies, inflation, changes in environmental laws or regulations, rate increases or decreases allowed by regulatory agencies, new legislation and market entry of competing electric power generators.\n2015 Capital Requirements, Sources of Financing and Financing Activities\nTotal capital requirements, consisting of capital expenditures and maturities of long-term debt, were $551.8 million and contractual obligations, net of recoveries through fuel adjustment clauses, were $84.8 million resulting in total net capital requirements and contractual obligations of $636.6 million in 2015, of which $130.6 million was to comply with environmental regulations. This compares to net capital requirements of $705.6 million and net contractual obligations of $87.4 million totaling $793.0 million in 2014, of which $31.5 million was to comply with environmental regulations.\nIn 2015, OG&E's sources of capital were cash generated from operations and proceeds from the issuance of short and long-term debt. Changes in working capital reflect the seasonal nature of OG&E's business, the revenue lag between billing and collection from customers and fuel inventories. See \"Working Capital\" for a discussion of significant changes in net working capital requirements as it pertains to operating cash flow and liquidity.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act\nDerivative instruments are utilized in managing OG&E's commodity price exposures. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for a new regulatory regime for derivatives, including mandatory clearing of certain swaps and margin requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act contains provisions that should exempt certain derivatives end-users such as OG&E from much of the clearing requirements. The regulations require that the decision on whether to use the end-user exception from mandatory clearing for derivative transactions be reviewed and approved by an \"appropriate committee\" of the Board of Directors. On January 12, 2015, President Obama signed into law an amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act that exempts from margin requirements swaps used by end-users to hedge or mitigate commercial risk. There are, however, some rulemakings that have no yet been finalized. Even if OG&E qualifies for the end-user exception to clearing and margin requirements are not imposed on end-users, its derivative counterparties may be subject to new capital, margin and business conduct requirements as a result of the new regulations, which may increase OG&E's transaction costs or make it more difficult to enter into derivative transactions on favorable terms. OG&E's inability to enter into derivative transactions on favorable terms, or at all, could increase operating expenses and put OG&E at increased exposure to risks of adverse changes in commodities prices. The impact of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act on OG&E cannot be fully determined at this time due to uncertainty over forthcoming regulations and potential changes to the derivatives markets arising from new regulatory requirements.\nFuture Sources of Financing\nManagement expects that cash generated from operations, proceeds from the issuance of long and short-term debt and funds received from OGE Energy (proceeds from OGE Energy's offerings) will be adequate over the next three years to meet anticipated cash needs and to fund future growth opportunities. OG&E utilizes short-term borrowings (through a combination of bank borrowings, commercial paper and borrowings from OGE Energy) to satisfy temporary working capital needs and as an interim source of financing capital expenditures until permanent financing is arranged.\nShort-Term Debt and Credit Facility\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014 , there were $333.6 million and $215.6 million in advances to OGE Energy. OG&E has an intercompany borrowing agreement with OGE Energy whereby OG&E has access to up to $400.0 million of OGE Energy's revolving credit amount. This agreement has a termination date of December 13, 2018. At December 31, 2015, there were no intercompany borrowings under this agreement. OG&E has a $400.0 million revolving credit facility which is available to back up OG&E's commercial paper borrowings and to provide revolving credit borrowings. This bank facility can also be used as a letter of credit facility. At December 31, 2015, there was $1.9 million supporting letters of credit at a weighted-average interest rate of 0.95 percent. There were no outstanding borrowings under this revolving credit agreement and no outstanding commercial paper borrowings at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, OG&E had $398.1 million of net available liquidity under its revolving credit agreement. OG&E has the necessary regulatory approvals to incur up to $800.0 million in short-term borrowings at any one time for a two-year period beginning January 1, 2015 and ending December 31, 2016. See Note 10 of Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of OG&E's short-term debt activity.\nIn December 2011, OG&E entered into an unsecured five-year revolving credit agreement for $400.0 million. This credit facility contained an option, which could be exercised up to two times, to extend the term for an additional year. In the third quarter of 2013, OG&E utilized one of these one-year extensions, and received consent from all of the lenders, to extend the maturity of its credit agreement from December 13, 2016 to December 13, 2017. In the second quarter of 2014, OG&E utilized its second extension to extend the maturity of its credit facility from December 13, 2017 to December 13, 2018. As of December 31,\n2015, the commitment of approximately $8.7 million of OG&E's credit facility, however, was not extended and, unless the non-extending lender is replaced in accordance with the terms of the credit facility, the commitment will expire December 13, 2017.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe Financial Statements and Notes to Financial Statements contain information that is pertinent to Management's Discussion and Analysis. In preparing the Financial Statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Changes to these assumptions and estimates could have a material effect on OG&E's Financial Statements. However, OG&E believes it has taken reasonable positions where assumptions and estimates are used in order to minimize the negative financial impact to OG&E that could result if actual results vary from the assumptions and estimates. In management's opinion, the areas of OG&E where the most significant judgment is exercised includes the determination of Pension Plan assumptions, income taxes, contingency reserves, asset retirement obligations, and depreciable lives of property, plant and equipment, the determination of regulatory assets and liabilities and unbilled revenues. The selection, application and disclosure of the following critical accounting estimates have been discussed with OGE Energy's Audit Committee. OG&E discusses its significant accounting policies, including those that do not require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates, in Note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements.\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nOGE Energy has a Pension Plan that covers a significant amount of OG&E's employees hired before December 1, 2009. Also, effective December 1, 2009, OGE Energy's Pension Plan is no longer being offered to employees hired on or after December 1, 2009. OGE Energy also has defined benefit postretirement plans that cover a significant amount of its employees. Pension and other postretirement plan expenses and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by the market value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, assumed discount rates and the level of funding. Actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized. The pension plan rate assumptions are shown in Note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements. The assumed return on plan assets is based on management's expectation of the long-term return on the plan assets portfolio. The discount rate used to compute the present value of plan liabilities is based generally on rates of high-grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which benefits will be paid. The level of funding is dependent on returns on plan assets and future discount rates. Higher returns on plan assets and an increase in discount rates will reduce funding requirements to the Pension Plan. The following table indicates the sensitivity of the Pension Plan funded status to these variables.\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>Impact on Funded Status\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Actual plan asset returns\n</td> <td>+/- 1 percent\n</td> <td>+/- $5.8 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>+/- 0.25 percent\n</td> <td>+/- $14.1 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contributions\n</td> <td>+/- $10 million\n</td> <td>+/- $10.0 million\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes\nOG&E uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, a deferred tax asset or liability is recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities as well as tax credit carry forwards and net operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of the change.\nThe application of income tax law is complex. Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and often ambiguous. Interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time. Accordingly, it is necessary to make judgments regarding income tax exposure. As a result, changes in these judgments can materially affect amounts OG&E recognized in its financial statements. Tax positions taken by OG&E on its income tax returns that are recognized in the financial statements must satisfy a more likely than not recognition threshold, assuming that the position will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nOG&E has previously recorded asset retirement obligations that are being amortized over their respective lives ranging from three to 74 years. The inputs used in the valuation of asset retirement obligations include the assumed life of the asset placed into service, the average inflation rate, market risk premium, the credit-adjusted risk free interest rate and the timing of incurring costs related to the retirement of the asset.\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nOG&E, as a regulated utility, is subject to accounting principles for certain types of rate-regulated activities, which provide that certain incurred costs that would otherwise be charged to expense can be deferred as regulatory assets, based on the expected recovery from customers in future rates. Likewise, certain actual or anticipated credits that would otherwise reduce expense can be deferred as regulatory liabilities, based on the expected flowback to customers in future rates. Management's expected recovery of deferred costs and flowback of deferred credits generally results from specific decisions by regulators granting such ratemaking treatment.\nOG&E records certain incurred costs and obligations as regulatory assets or liabilities if, based on regulatory orders or other available evidence, it is probable that the costs or obligations will be included in amounts allowable for recovery or refund in future rates. The benefit obligations regulatory asset is comprised of expenses recorded which are probable of future recovery and that have not yet been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost, including net loss and prior service cost.\nUnbilled Revenues\nOG&E recognizes revenue from electric sales when power is delivered to customers. OG&E reads its customers' meters and sends bills to its customers throughout each month. As a result, there is a significant amount of customers' electricity consumption that has not been billed at the end of each month. OG&E accrues an estimate of the revenues for electric sales delivered since the latest billings. Unbilled revenue is presented in Accrued Unbilled Revenues on the Balance Sheets and in Operating Revenues on the Statements of Income based on estimates of usage and prices during the period. At December 31, 2015, if the estimated usage or price used in the unbilled revenue calculation were to increase or decrease by one percent, this would cause a change in the unbilled revenues recognized of $0.3 million. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, Accrued Unbilled Revenues were $53.5 million and $55.5 million, respectively. The estimates that management uses in this calculation could vary from the actual amounts to be paid by customers.\nAllowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable\nCustomer balances are generally written off if not collected within six months after the final billing date. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for OG&E is calculated by multiplying the last six months of electric revenue by the provision rate. The provision rate is based on a 12-month historical average of actual balances written off. To the extent the historical collection rates are not representative of future collections, there could be an effect on the amount of uncollectible expense recognized. Also, a portion of the uncollectible provision related to fuel within the Oklahoma jurisdiction is being recovered through the fuel adjustment clause. At December 31, 2015, if the provision rate were to increase or decrease by 10 percent, this would cause a change in the uncollectible expense recognized of $0.1 million. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is a reduction to Accounts Receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is included in the Other Operation and Maintenance Expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $1.4 million and $1.6 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nAccounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 of Notes to Financial Statements for discussion of current accounting pronouncements that are applicable to OG&E.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nIn the normal course of business, OG&E is confronted with issues or events that may result in a contingent liability. These generally relate to lawsuits or claims made by third parties, including governmental agencies. When appropriate, management consults with legal counsel and other experts to assess the claim. If, in management's opinion, OG&E has incurred a probable loss as set forth by GAAP, an estimate is made of the loss and the appropriate accounting entries are reflected in OG&E's Financial Statements. At the present time, based on available information, OG&E believes that any reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued amounts arising out of pending or threatened lawsuits or claims would not be quantitatively material to its financial\nstatements and would not have a material adverse effect on OG&E's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Notes 12 and 13 of Notes to Financial Statements and Item 3 of Part I in this Form 10-K for a discussion of OG&E's commitments and contingencies.\nEnvironmental Laws and Regulations\nThe activities of OG&E are subject to numerous stringent and complex Federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection. These laws and regulations can change, restrict or otherwise impact OG&E's business activities in many ways including the handling or disposal of waste material, future construction activities to avoid or mitigate harm to threatened or endangered species and requiring the installation and operation of emissions pollution control equipment. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. OG&E believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with current Federal, state and local environmental standards.\nEnvironmental regulation can increase the cost of planning, design, initial installation and operation of OG&E's facilities. Historically, OG&E's total expenditures for environmental control facilities and for remediation have not been significant in relation to its financial position or results of operations. OG&E believes, however, that it is likely that the trend in environmental legislation and regulations will continue towards more restrictive standards. Compliance with these standards is expected to increase the cost of conducting business. Management continues to evaluate its compliance with existing and proposed environmental legislation and regulations and implement appropriate environmental programs in a competitive market.\nOG&E expects that environmental expenditures necessary to comply with the environmental laws and regulations discussed below will qualify as part of a pre-approval plan to handle state and Federally mandated environmental upgrades which will be recoverable in Oklahoma from OG&E's retail customers under House Bill 1910, which was enacted into law in May 2005.\nIt is estimated that OG&E's total expenditures to comply with environmental laws, regulations and requirements for 2016 will be $195.9 million, of which $178.3 million is for capital expenditures. It is estimated that OG&E's total expenditures to comply with environmental laws, regulations and requirements for 2017 will be approximately $166.7 million, of which $148.7 million is for capital expenditures. The amounts above include capital expenditures for low NOX burners and dry scrubbers.\nAir\nFederal Clean Air Act Overview\nOG&E's operations are subject to the Federal Clean Air Act as amended, and comparable state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including electric generating units, and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. Such laws and regulations may require that OG&E obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions or result in the increase of existing air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations or install emission control equipment. OG&E likely will be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment and technology in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions.\nRegional Haze Control Measures\nThe EPA's 2005 regional haze rule is intended to protect visibility in certain national parks and wilderness areas throughout the United States that may be impacted by air pollutant emissions.\nOn February 18, 2010, Oklahoma submitted its SIP to the EPA, which set forth the state's plan for compliance with the Federal regional haze rule. The SIP was subject to the EPA's review and approval.\nThe Oklahoma SIP included requirements for reducing emissions of NOX and SO2 from OG&E's seven BART-eligible units at the Seminole, Muskogee and Sooner generating stations. The SIP also included a waiver from BART requirements for all eligible units at the Horseshoe Lake generating station based on air modeling that showed no significant impact on visibility in nearby national parks and wilderness areas. The SIP concluded that BART for reducing NOX emissions at all of the subject units should be the installation of low NOX burners with overfired air (flue gas recirculation was also required on two of the units) and set forth associated NOX emission rates and limits.\nOn December 28, 2011, the EPA issued a final rule in which it rejected the SO2 portion of the Oklahoma SIP and issued a FIP in its place. OG&E and the State of Oklahoma's subsequent appeal of the FIP with the Tenth Circuit of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court ended on May 27, 2014 when the Supreme Court denied OG&E's Petition for Certiorari, upholding the EPA's FIP for SO2. The FIP compliance date is now January 4, 2019.\nOn December 9, 2015, the EPA released a final rule partially disapproving the revisions to the 2010 Oklahoma SIP for Regional Haze and promulgated FIPs in their place for Oklahoma and Texas. The EPA disapproved portions of the Oklahoma SIP related to the establishment of Reasonable Progress Goals for the Class I area located within the state and promulgated revised Reasonable Progress Goals based on the FIP implementation in Texas. As a result, no further requirements are required in Oklahoma to meet the 2018 Reasonable Progress Goals for Oklahoma.\nOn August 6, 2014, OG&E filed an application with the OCC for approval of its plan to comply with the EPA's MATS and Regional Haze FIP while serving the best long-term interests of customers in light of future environmental uncertainties. The application seeks approval of the environmental compliance plan and for a recovery mechanism for the associated costs. The ECP includes installing dry scrubbers at Sooner Units 1 and 2 and the conversion of Muskogee Units 4 and 5 to natural gas. The application also asked the OCC to predetermine the prudence of replacing OG&E's soon-to-be retired Mustang steam turbines in late 2017 with 400 MWs of new, efficient combustion turbines at the Mustang site in 2018 and 2019 and approval for a recovery mechanism for the associated costs. OG&E estimates the total capital cost associated with its environmental compliance plan included in this application to be approximately $1.1 billion. The OCC hearing on OG&E's application before an ALJ began on March 3, 2015 and concluded on April 8, 2015. Multiple parties advocating a variety of positions intervened in the proceeding.\nOn June 8, 2015, the ALJ issued his report on OG&E's application. While the ALJ in his report agreed that the installation of dry scrubbers at Sooner Units 1 and 2 and the conversion of Muskogee Units 4 and 5 to natural gas pursuant to OG&E's ECP is the best approach, the ALJ's report included several recommendations. OG&E filed exceptions to the ALJ's report and on July 21, 2015, Commissioner Bob Anthony issued his deliberation statement that was consistent with many parts of the ALJ's report, including the ALJ's support of OG&E's ECP, the ALJ's recommendation to pre-approve certain estimated costs of the environmental recovery plan, and the ALJ's recommendation to defer all other cost recovery issues until the next general rate case.\nOn December 2, 2015, OG&E received an order from the OCC denying, by a two to one vote, its plan to comply with the environmental mandates of the Federal Clean Air Act, Regional Haze and MATS. The OCC also denied OG&E's request for pre-approval of its Mustang Modernization Plan, revised depreciation rates for both the retirement of the Mustang units and the replacement combustion turbines and pre-approval of early retirement and replacement of generating units at its Mustang site, including cost recovery through a rider.\nOn December 11, 2015, OG&E filed a motion requesting modification of the OCC order for the purposes of approving only the ECP. OG&E did not seek modification to any other provisions of the OCC order, including cost recovery. OG&E also agreed that it would not implement a rider for recovery of the costs of the ECP until and unless authorized by the OCC in a subsequent proceeding. On December 23, 2015, the OCC rejected, by a two to one vote, a proposal by Commissioner Dana Murphy to grant OG&E's December 11, 2015 motion.\nOn February 12, 2016, OG&E filed an application requesting the OCC to issue an order approving the installation of dry scrubbers at the Sooner facility, on or before May 2, 2016. The application states that if the application is not approved by May 2, 2016, OG&E will decide at that time whether to cancel the dry scrubber equipment and installation contracts and make plans to convert the Sooner coal units to natural gas. As of December 31, 2015, OG&E had incurred $94.8 million of construction work in progress on the dry scrubbers. OG&E estimates another $35.0 million of in-process expenditures will be incurred prior to May 1, 2016. Additionally, if the request is not approved, OG&E expects to seek recovery in subsequent proceedings for the expenditures incurred for the dry scrubber project and reasonable stranded costs associated with the discontinuance of the Sooner coal units.\nCross-State Air Pollution Rule\nIn August 2011, the EPA finalized its CSAPR that required 27 states in the eastern half of the United States to reduce power plant emissions that contribute to ozone and particulate matter pollution in other states. In December 2011, the EPA published a supplemental CSAPR, which would make six additional states, including Oklahoma, subject to the CSAPR for NOX emissions during the ozone-season from May 1 through September 30. Under the rule, OG&E would have been required to reduce ozone-season NOX emissions from its electrical generating units within the state beginning in 2012. In response to legal challenges of the final rule on December 30, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals issued a stay of the rule, which includes the supplemental rule, pending a decision on the merits. By order dated August 21, 2012, the Court of Appeals vacated the CSAPR and ordered the EPA to promulgate a replacement rule. On April 29, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the decision by the Court of Appeals. On October 23, 2014, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit granted the EPA's request that the court lift the stay\nof the CSAPR. The EPA subsequently clarified that compliance with the CSAPR would begin in 2015 using the amount of allowances originally scheduled to be available in 2012. As of December 31, 2015, OG&E has installed five low NOX burner systems on two Muskogee units, two Sooner units and one Seminole unit and is in compliance with the final rule. In the meantime, the petitions for review of the supplemental rule remain pending before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals for consideration of issues that are not addressed by the Supreme Court's decision.\nOn December 3, 2015, the EPA proposed an update to CSAPR finding that ozone-season NOX emissions in 23 eastern states including Oklahoma affect the ability of downwind states to attain and maintain ozone standards and proposing to issue FIPs to update the existing NOX ozone-season emission budgets for electrical generating units. The proposed rule reduces OG&E's NOX emissions requirements under the current CSAPR by 25 percent. Compliance is proposed to begin in May 2017. OG&E continues to evaluate what additional measures, if any, will be needed for compliance with the new rule.\nHazardous Air Pollutants Emission Standards\nOn February 16, 2012, the EPA published the final MATS rule regulating the emissions of certain hazardous air pollutants from electric generating units, which became effective April 16, 2012. The final rule uses a numerical standard to establish limits for particulate matter (as a surrogate for toxic metals), hydrogen chloride and mercury emissions from coal-fired boilers. Compliance was required within three years of the rule's effective date. Based on OG&E's request for a one-year extension, the deadline for compliance was extended to April 16, 2016. To comply with this rule, OG&E utilized activated carbon injections at each of its five coal-fired units during 2015.\nThe final MATS rule was appealed by several parties, but OG&E was not a party to the appeals. After withstanding judicial scrutiny at the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals, the MATS rule was challenged at the U.S. Supreme Court. On June 29, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court found that the EPA should have considered the compliance costs imposed on utilities at the first stage of the EPA's regulatory analysis. The U.S. Supreme Court did not vacate the rule, but reversed the D.C. Circuit's decision and remanded to the D.C. Circuit for further proceedings. The MATS rule currently remains in effect and OG&E is still required to meet the April 2016 compliance deadline.\nFederal Clean Air Act New Source Review Litigation\nAs previously reported, in July 2008, OG&E received a request for information from the EPA regarding Federal Clean Air Act compliance at OG&E's Muskogee and Sooner generating plants.\nOn July 8, 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a complaint against OG&E in United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma alleging that OG&E did not follow the Federal Clean Air Act procedures for projecting emission increases attributable to eight projects that occurred between 2003 and 2006. This complaint seeks to have OG&E submit a new assessment of whether the projects were likely to result in a significant emissions increase. The Sierra Club intervened in this proceeding. On August 30, 2013, the government filed a Motion for Summary Judgment and on September 6, 2013, OG&E filed a Motion to Dismiss the case. On January 15, 2015, U.S. District Judge Timothy DeGuisti dismissed the complaints filed by the EPA and the Sierra Club. The Court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs' claims because plaintiffs failed to present an actual case or controversy\u201d as required by Article III of the Constitution. The court also ruled in the alternative that, even if plaintiffs had presented a case or controversy, it would have nonetheless decline[d] to exercise jurisdiction.\u201d The EPA and the Sierra Club did not file an appeal of the Court's ruling.\nOn August 12, 2013, the Sierra Club filed a separate complaint against OG&E in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma alleging that OG&E projects at Muskogee Unit 6 in 2008 were made without obtaining a prevention of significant deterioration permit and that the plant had exceeded emissions limits for opacity and particulate matter. The Sierra Club seeks a permanent injunction preventing OG&E from operating the Muskogee generating plant. On March 4, 2014, the Eastern District dismissed the prevention of significant deterioration permit claim based on the statute of limitations, but allowed the opacity and particulate matter claims to proceed. To obtain the right to appeal this decision, the Sierra Club subsequently withdrew a Notice of Intent to Sue for additional Clean Air Act violations and asked the Eastern District to dismiss its remaining claims with prejudice. On August 27, 2014, the Eastern District granted the Sierra Club's request. The Sierra Club has filed a Notice of Appeal with the 10th Circuit where oral argument was held on March 18, 2015.\nAt this time, OG&E continues to believe that it has acted in compliance with the Federal Clean Air Act, and OG&E expects to vigorously defend against the claims that have been asserted. If OG&E does not prevail in the remainder of the proceedings, the EPA and the Sierra Club could seek to require OG&E to install additional pollution control equipment, including dry scrubbers, baghouses and selective catalytic reduction systems with capital costs in excess of $1.1 billion and pay fines and significant penalties as a result of the allegations in the notice of violation. Section 113 of the Federal Clean Air Act (along with\nthe Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1996) provides for civil penalties as much as $37,500 per day for each violation. Due to the uncertain and preliminary nature of this litigation, OG&E cannot provide a range of reasonably possible loss in this case.\nNational Ambient Air Quality Standards\nThe EPA is required to set NAAQS for certain pollutants considered to be harmful to public health or the environment. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to review each NAAQS every five years. As a result of these reviews, the EPA periodically has taken action to adopt more stringent NAAQS for those pollutants. If any areas of Oklahoma were to be designated as not attaining the NAAQS for a particular pollutant, OG&E could be required to install additional emission controls on its facilities to help the state achieve attainment with the NAAQS. As of the end of 2015, no areas of Oklahoma had been designated as non-attainment for pollutants that are likely to affect OG&E's operations. Several processes are under way to designate areas in Oklahoma as attaining or not attaining revised NAAQS. OG&E is monitoring those processes and their possible impact on its operations but, at this time, cannot determine with any certainty whether they will cause a material impact to OG&E's financial results.\nIn August of 2013, the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council filed a complaint under the citizen suit provision of the Clean Air Act based on the EPA's failure to promulgate and publish designations for the 2010 revised primary SO2 NAAQS. On March 2, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued an order granting the EPA and the Sierra Club's joint motion to approve and enter a consent decree that set forth mandatory deadlines for the EPA to issue designations for all areas of the country that remained undesignated. On September 18, 2015 the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality reported to the EPA that no areas in Oklahoma should be designated as non-attainment for the 2010 SO2 standard. This non-attainment designation is subject to the EPA's approval. In a letter dated February 11, 2016, EPA Region 6 notified Oklahoma of their intent to designate part of Muskogee County in which OG&E's Muskogee Power Plant is located, as non-attainment for the 2010 SO2 NAAQS. EPA is expected to finalize this designation in July, 2016 following public comment. This could require additional controls scrubbers on the affected units. On August 21, 2015, EPA finalized a data requirements rule for implementing the 2010 SO2 standard requiring air agencies to characterize air quality around sources that emit 2,000 tons per year or more of SO2 via air quality modeling or ambient air monitoring. In July 2016, air agencies will be required to identify either ambient monitoring or air quality modeling as a method for characterizing air quality for 2,000 tons per year or larger sources. At this time, OG&E cannot determine with any certainty whether this determination will cause a material impact to its financial results.\nOn September 30, 2015 the EPA finalized a new ambient standard for ozone at 70 ppb which is more stringent than the current standard of 75 ppb, set in 2008. States must submit non-attainment designations as appropriate based on existing ambient data before October 2016 for the EPA's approval. Compliance with the new standard begins in 2020 or later depending on the degree of the area's non-attainment designation. All areas in Oklahoma currently meet the new standard.\nOG&E is monitoring those processes and their possible impact on its operations but, at this time, cannot determine with any certainty whether they will cause a material impact to OG&E's financial results.\nClean Power Plan\nOn October 23, 2015, the EPA published the final Clean Power Plan that established standards of performance for CO2 emissions from existing fossil-fuel-fired power plants along with state-specific CO2 reduction standards expressed as both rate-based (lbs/MWh) and mass-based (tons/yr) goals. The 2030 rate-based reduction requirement for all existing generating units in Oklahoma has decreased from a proposed 43 percent reduction to 32 percent in the final rule. The mass-based approach for existing units calls for a 24 percent reduction by 2030 in Oklahoma. The Clean Power Plan requires that states submit to the EPA plans for achieving the state-specific CO2 reduction goals by September 6, 2016 or submit an extension request for up to two years. The compliance period was to begin in 2022, and emission reductions were to be phased in by 2030. The EPA also proposed a federal compliance plan to implement the Clean Power Plan in the event that an approvable state plan was not submitted to the EPA by the required deadline.\nA number of states have filed lawsuits against the Clean Power Plan. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued orders staying implementation of the Clean Power Plan pending resolution of challenges to the rule. The Company is unable to determine what impact the lawsuits will ultimately have on the Clean Power Plan or what impact the stay in implementation will have; however, if the Clean Power Plan survives judicial review and is implemented as written, it could result in significant additional compliance costs that would affect our future consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates. Significant uncertainties would remain with regards to potential implementation in Oklahoma (and the federal plan that would be imposed by the EPA for states that do not submit approvable\nplans), including whether states would elect an emissions standards approach versus a state measures approach, whether and what type of emissions trading would be allowed, and available cost mitigation options. Due to the pending litigation and the uncertainties in the state approaches, the ultimate timing and impact of these standards on our operations cannot be determined with certainty at this time.\nClimate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emissions\nThere is continuing discussion and evaluation of possible global climate change in certain regulatory and legislative arenas. The focus is generally on emissions of greenhouse gases, including CO2, sulfur hexafluoride and methane, and whether these emissions are contributing to the warming of the earth's atmosphere. In December 2015, as part of the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the United States committed to reduce economy wide emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 emission levels. This multinational agreement will be open for signing on April 22, 2016 and will require countries to review and \"represent a progression\" every five years beginning in 2020. The agreement could result in future additional emissions reductions in the United States, however, it is not possible to determine what the international legal standards for greenhouse gas emissions will be in the future and the extent to which commitments under the December 2015 Paris Agreement will be implemented through the Clean Air Act, other than existing statutes and new legislation. If legislation or regulations are passed at the Federal or state levels in the future requiring mandatory reductions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases on OG&E's facilities, this could result in significant additional compliance costs that would affect OG&E's future financial position, results of operations and cash flows if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.\nSeveral states have passed laws, adopted regulations or undertaken regulatory initiatives to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs.\nIf legislation or regulations are passed at the Federal or state levels in the future requiring mandatory reductions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases on OG&E's facilities, this could result in significant additional compliance costs that would affect OG&E's future financial position, results of operations and cash flows if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.\nIn 2009, the EPA adopted a comprehensive national system for reporting emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases produced by major sources in the United States. The reporting requirements apply to large direct emitters of greenhouse gases with emissions equal to or greater than a threshold of 25,000 metric tons per year, which includes certain OG&E facilities. OG&E also reports quarterly its CO2 emissions from generating units subject to the Federal Acid Rain Program. OG&E has submitted the reports required by the applicable reporting rules.\nNonetheless, OG&E's current business strategy will result in a reduced carbon emissions rate compared to current levels. As discussed in Pending Regulatory Matters\u201d, OG&E has filed an application with the OCC for approval of its plan to comply with the EPA's MATS and Regional Haze FIP by converting two coal-fired generating units at Muskogee Station to natural gas, among other measures. OG&E's deployment of Smart Grid technology helps to reduce the peak load demand. OG&E also seeks to utilize renewable energy sources that do not emit greenhouse gases. OG&E's service territory borders one of the nation's best wind resource areas. OG&E has leveraged its geographic position to develop renewable energy resources and completed transmission investments to deliver the renewable energy. The SPP has begun to authorize the construction of transmission lines capable of bringing renewable energy out of the wind resource area in western Oklahoma, the Texas Panhandle and western Kansas to load centers by planning for more transmission to be built in the area. In addition to increasing overall system reliability, these new transmission resources should provide greater access to additional wind resources that are currently constrained due to existing transmission delivery limitations.\nEPA Startup, Shutdown and Malfunction Policy\nOn May 22, 2015, the EPA issued a final rule to address the outdated provisions in the SIP of 36 states, including Oklahoma, regarding the treatment of emissions that occur during startup, shutdown and malfunction operations. The final rule clarifies the EPA's Startup, Shutdown and Malfunction Policy to assure consistency with the Clean Air Act and other recent court decisions. The Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality is in the process of developing a SIP to comply with this rule, which is to be submitted to the EPA before November 2016. Although the extent of impact is not known, this rule will impact certain OG&E units.\nEndangered Species\nCertain Federal laws, including the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Endangered Species Act, provide special protection to certain designated species. These laws and any state equivalents provide\nfor significant civil and criminal penalties for unpermitted activities that result in harm to or harassment of certain protected animals and plants, including damage to their habitats. If such species are located in an area in which OG&E conducts operations, or if additional species in those areas become subject to protection, OG&E's operations and development projects, particularly transmission, wind or pipeline projects, could be restricted or delayed, or OG&E could be required to implement expensive mitigation measures.\nIn 2014, OG&E enrolled in the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies range-wide conservation plan which consists of industry-specific conservation practices that apply to projects and activities in the impacted area. The range-wide conservation plan was approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and incorporated as part of the agency's final decision on March 27, 2014 to list the lesser prairie chicken as a threatened species. On September 1, 2015, the U.S. District Court Western District of Texas vacated federal protections for the lesser prairie chicken based on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's failure to thoroughly consider the active conservation efforts in making the listing decision.\nAir Quality Control System\nOn September 10, 2014, OG&E executed a contract for the design, engineering and fabrication of two circulating dry scrubber systems to be installed at Sooner Units 1 and 2. OG&E entered into an agreement on February 9, 2015, to install the dry scrubber systems. The dry scrubbers are part of OG&E's ECP and scheduled to be completed by 2019. More detail regarding the ECP can be found under the Pending Regulatory Matters\u201d section of \"Notes to Financial Statements\" of Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nWaste\nOG&E's operations generate wastes that are subject to the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 as well as comparable state laws which impose detailed requirements for the handling, storage, treatment and disposal of waste.\nOn December 19, 2014, the EPA finalized a rule under the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act for the handling and disposal of coal combustion residuals or coal ash. The final rule regulates coal ash as a solid waste rather than a hazardous waste, which would have made the management of coal ash more costly. OG&E has evaluated the potential impacts of the final rule on our ash ponds and has set up a reserve based on a reasonable estimate.\nOG&E has sought and will continue to seek pollution prevention opportunities and to evaluate the effectiveness of its waste reduction, reuse and recycling efforts. In 2015, OG&E obtained refunds of $2.3 million from the recycling of scrap metal, salvaged transformers and used transformer oil. This figure does not include the additional savings gained through the reduction and/or avoidance of disposal costs and the reduction in material purchases due to the reuse of existing materials. Similar savings are anticipated in future years.\nWater\nOG&E's operations are subject to the Federal Clean Water Act, and comparable state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations impose detailed requirements and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state and Federal waters.\nThe EPA issued a final rule on May 19, 2014 to implement Section 316(b) of the Federal Clean Water Act, which requires that power plant cooling water intake structure location, design, construction and capacity reflect the best available technology for minimizing their adverse environmental impact via the impingement and entrainment of aquatic organisms. The EPA issued a final rule on May 19, 2014. OG&E submitted compliance plans to the state in April 2015. OG&E expects to be able to provide a reasonable estimate of any material costs associated with the rule's implementation.\nSite Remediation\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment. Because OG&E utilizes various products and generate wastes that are considered hazardous substances for purposes of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, OG&E could be subject to liability for the costs of cleaning up and restoring sites where those substances have been released to the environment. At this time, it is not anticipated that any associated liability will cause a significant impact to OG&E.\nFor a further discussion regarding contingencies relating to environmental laws and regulations, see Note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements.", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I can't understand the table you've provided me with.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIntroduction\nOG&E generates, transmits, distributes and sells electric energy in Oklahoma and western Arkansas. Its operations are subject to regulation by the OCC, the APSC and the FERC. OG&E was incorporated in 1902 under the laws of the Oklahoma Territory. OG&E is the largest electric utility in Oklahoma and its franchised service territory includes Fort Smith, Arkansas and the surrounding communities. OG&E sold its retail natural gas business in 1928 and is no longer engaged in the natural gas distribution business. OG&E is a wholly-owned subsidiary of OGE Energy, an energy and energy services provider offering physical delivery and related services for both electricity and natural gas primarily in the south central United States.\nOverview\nOG&E Mission and Focus\nOGE Energy's mission, through OG&E and its equity interest in Enable, is to fulfill its critical role in the nation's electric utility and natural gas midstream pipeline infrastructure and meet individual customers' needs for energy and related services focusing on safety, efficiency, reliability, customer service and risk management.\nOG&E is focused on:\n \u2022 Providing exceptional customer experiences by continuing to improve customer interfaces, tools, products and services that deliver high customer satisfaction and operating productivity. \n \u2022 Providing safe, reliable energy to the communities and customers we serve. A particular focus is on enhancing the value of the grid by improving distribution grid reliability by reducing the frequency and duration of customer interruptions and leveraging previous grid technology investments. \n \u2022 Maintaining strong regulatory and legislative relationships for the long-term benefit of our customers, investors and members. \n \u2022 Continuing to grow a zero-injury culture and deliver top-quartile safety results. \n \u2022 Complying with the EPA's MATS and Regional Haze requirements. \n \u2022 Ensuring we have the necessary mix of generation resources to meet the long-term needs of our customers. \n \u2022 Continuing focus on operational excellence and efficiencies in order to protect the customer bill. \nSummary of Operating Results\n2015 compared to 2014. OG&E reported net income of $268.9 million and $292.0 million, respectively, in 2015 and 2014, a decrease of $23.1 million, or 7.9 percent, primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense due to additional assets being placed in service in 2015, and a decrease in gross margin related to milder weather and decreased wholesale transmission revenues. Partially offsetting these items was an increase in customer growth, an increase in other income and an increase in allowance for equity funds used during construction.\n2014 compared to 2013. OG&E reported net income of $292.0 million and $292.6 million, respectively, in 2014 and 2013, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 0.2 percent, reflecting an increase in depreciation expense due to additional assets being placed in service in 2014, a decrease in gross margin related to milder weather compared to 2013, an increase in other operation and maintenance expense and an increase in interest expense related to the issuance of debt. Partially offsetting these items was an increase in wholesale transmission revenues, an increase in customer growth and a decrease in incentive compensation.\n2016 Outlook\nOG&E projects to earn approximately $288 million to $300 million or $1.44 to $1.50 per average diluted share in 2016 and is based on the following assumptions:\n \u2022 normal weather patterns are experienced for the remainder of the year; \n \u2022 new rates take effect in Oklahoma in mid 2016; \n \u2022 gross margin on revenues of approximately $1.405 billion to $1.415 billion based on sales growth of approximately one percent on a weather-adjusted basis; \n \u2022 approximately $106 million of gross margin is primarily attributed to regionally allocated transmission projects; \n \u2022 operating expenses of approximately $885 million to $895 million, with operation and maintenance expenses comprising 54 percent of the total; \n \u2022 interest expense of approximately $140 million which assumes a $8 million allowance for borrowed funds used during construction reduction to interest expense; \n \u2022 other income of approximately $27 million including approximately $15 million of allowance for equity funds used during construction; and \n \u2022 an effective tax rate of approximately 28 percent. \nOG&E has significant seasonality in its earnings. OG&E typically shows minimal earnings in the first and fourth quarters with a majority of earnings in the third quarter due to the seasonal nature of air conditioning demand.\nGross margin is defined by OG&E as operating revenues less fuel, purchased power and certain transmission expenses. Gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes depreciation and amortization, and other operation and maintenance expenses. Expenses for fuel and purchased power are recovered through fuel adjustment clauses and as a result changes in these expenses are offset in operating revenues with no impact on net income. OG&E believes gross margin provides a more meaningful basis for evaluating its operations across periods than operating revenues because gross margin excludes the revenue effect of fluctuations in these expenses. Gross margin is used internally to measure performance against budget and in reports for management and the Board of Directors. OG&E's definition of gross margin may be different from similar terms used by other companies.\nReconciliation of gross margin to revenue:\n\n (A) Based on the midpoint of OG&E earnings guidance for 2016. \nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis presents factors that affected OG&E's results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 and OG&E's financial position at December 31, 2015 and 2014. The following information should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and Notes thereto. Known trends and contingencies of a material nature are discussed to the extent considered relevant.\n\n\n (A) Degree days are calculated as follows: The high and low degrees of a particular day are added together and then averaged. If the calculated average is above 65 degrees, then the difference between the calculated average and 65 is expressed as cooling degree days, with each degree of difference equaling one cooling degree day. If the calculated average is below 65 degrees, then the difference between the calculated average and 65 is expressed as heating degree days, with each degree of difference equaling one heating degree day. The daily calculations are then totaled for the particular reporting period. \n2015 compared to 2014. OG&E's net income decreased $23.1 million, or 7.9 percent, in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to higher depreciation expense and lower gross margin partially offset by higher other income and an increase in allowance for equity funds used in construction.\nGross Margin\nOperating revenues were $2,196.9 million in 2015 as compared to $2,453.1 million in 2014, a decrease of $256.2 million, or 10.4 percent. Cost of sales were $865.0 million in 2015 as compared to $1,106.6 million in 2014, a decrease of $241.6 million, or 21.8 percent. Gross margin was $1,331.9 million in 2015 as compared to $1,346.5 million in 2014, a decrease of $14.6 million, or 1.1 percent. The below factors contributed to the change in gross margin:\n\n (A) The overall cooling degree days decreased two percent in 2015 compared to 2014 with August decreasing by 14 percent. \n (B) Decreased primarily due to a true up for the base plan projects in the SPP formula rate for 2014 and 2015 as well as a reduction in the point-to-point credits shared with retail customers. \n (C) On June 30, 2015, the wholesale power contract with AVEC expired. \n (D) Increased primarily due to sales and customer mix. \nCost of sales for OG&E consists of fuel used in electric generation, purchased power and transmission related charges. Fuel expense was $458.5 million in 2015 as compared to $627.5 million in 2014, a decrease of $169.0 million, or 26.9 percent, primarily due to lower natural gas prices offset by higher natural gas used. In 2015, OG&E's fuel mix was 49 percent coal, 44 percent natural gas and seven percent wind. In 2014, OG&E's fuel mix was 61 percent coal, 32 percent natural gas and seven percent wind. Purchased power costs were $362.6 million in 2015 as compared to $444.1 million in 2014, a decrease of $81.5 million, or 18.4 percent, primarily due to a decrease in purchases from the SPP, reflecting the impact of OG&E's participation in the SPP Integrated Marketplace, which began on March 1, 2014. Transmission related charges were $43.9 million in 2015 as compared to $35.0 million in 2014, an increase of $8.9 million, or 25.4 percent, primarily due to higher SPP charges for the base plan projects of other utilities.\nThe actual cost of fuel used in electric generation and certain purchased power costs are passed through to OG&E's customers through fuel adjustment clauses. The fuel adjustment clauses are subject to periodic review by the OCC, the APSC and the FERC. The OCC, the APSC and the FERC have authority to review the appropriateness of gas transportation charges or other fees OG&E pays to its affiliate, Enable.\nOperating Expenses\nOther operation and maintenance expenses were $444.5 million in 2015 as compared to $453.2 million in 2014, a decrease of $8.7 million, or 1.9 percent. The below factors contributed to the change in other operations and maintenance expense:\n\n (A) Decreased primarily due to more capital projects and storm costs exceeding the $2.7 million threshold, which were moved to a regulatory asset. \n (B) Decreased primarily due to less work at the power plants. \n (C) Decreased primarily due to decreased engineering services. \n (D) Increased primarily due to higher medical costs incurred partially offset by lower pension costs. \n (E) Increased primarily due to higher demand side management customer payments. \n (F) Increased primarily due to annual salary increases and increased overtime related to storms. \nDepreciation and amortization expense was $299.9 million in 2015 as compared to $270.8 million in 2014, an increase of $29.1 million, or 10.7 percent, primarily due to additional assets being placed in service, along with an increase resulting from the amortization of deferred pension credits and post-retirement medical regulatory liabilities which were fully amortized in July 2014 and amortization of deferred storm costs.\nAdditional Information\nAllowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction. Allowance for equity funds used during construction was $8.3 million in 2015 as compared to $4.2 million in 2014, an increase of $4.1 million, or 97.6 percent, primarily due to higher construction work in progress balances resulting from increased spending for environmental projects.\nOther Income. Other income was $13.3 million in 2015 as compared to $4.8 million in 2014, an increase of $8.5 million, primarily due to increased guaranteed flat bill margins and an increase in the tax gross up related to higher allowance for funds used during construction.\nIncome Tax Expense. Income tax expense was $104.8 million in 2015 as compared to $111.6 million in 2014, a decrease of $6.8 million, or 6.1 percent, primarily due to lower pretax income partially offset by a reduction in Federal tax credits.\n2014 compared to 2013. OG&E's net income decreased $0.6 million, or 0.2 percent, in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to higher gross margin, which was almost offset by higher other operations and maintenance expense, higher depreciation and amortization expense, and interest expense.\nGross Margin\nOperating revenues were $2,453.1 million in 2014 as compared to $2,262.2 million in 2013, an increase of $190.9 million, or 8.4 percent. Cost of sales were $1,106.6 million in 2014 as compared to $965.9 million in 2013, an increase of $140.7 million, or 14.6 percent. Gross margin was $1,346.5 million in 2014 as compared to $1,296.3 million in 2013, an increase of $50.2 million, or 3.9 percent. The below factors contributed to the change in gross margin:\n\n (A) Increased primarily due to higher investments related to certain FERC approved transmission projects included in formula rates. \n (B) Increased due to higher rider revenues primarily from the Oklahoma Demand Program rider, the Oklahoma Storm Recovery rider and the Arkansas Demand Program rider partially offset by lower rider revenues from the Oklahoma Crossroads rider, Oklahoma Smart Grid rider, Oklahoma System Hardening rider and the Arkansas Crossroads rider. \nCost of sales for OG&E consists of fuel used in electric generation, purchased power and transmission related charges. Fuel expense was $627.5 million in 2014 as compared to $672.7 million in 2013, a decrease of $45.2 million, or 6.7 percent, primarily due to lower natural gas used offset by higher natural gas prices. In 2014, OG&E's fuel mix was 61 percent coal, 32 percent natural gas and seven percent wind. In 2013, OG&E's fuel mix was 53 percent coal, 40 percent natural gas and seven percent wind. Purchased power costs were $444.1 million in 2014 as compared to $267.6 million in 2013, an increase of $176.5 million, or 66 percent, primarily due to an increase in purchases from the SPP, reflecting the impact of OG&E's participation in the SPP Integrated Marketplace, which began on March 1, 2014. Transmission related charges were $35.0 million in 2014 as compared to $25.6 million in 2013, an increase of $9.4 million, or 36.7 percent, primarily due to higher SPP charges for the base plan projects of other utilities.\nOperating Expenses\nOther operation and maintenance expenses were $453.2 million in 2014 as compared to $438.8 million in 2013, an increase of $14.4 million, or 3.3 percent. The below factors contributed to the change in other operations and maintenance expense:\n\n (A) Portion of labor costs capitalized into projects decreased as a result of less work performed on storm restoration. \n (B) Increased primarily due to higher allocated costs from the holding company resulting from the formation of Enable during 2013. \n (C) Increased primarily due to demand side management customer payments which are recovered through a rider partially offset by a reduction in media services expense. \n (D) Increased as a result of higher expenditures related to Smart Grid software. \n (E) Increased primarily due to higher SPP administration and assessment fees. \n (F) Decreased primarily due to increased spending on system hardening in 2013 which includes costs that are being recovered through a rider. \n (G) Decreased primarily due to lower pension expense, postretirement and other benefits. \n (H) Decreased primarily due to incentive compensation and lower overtime wages partially offset by higher regular salaries and wages. \nDepreciation and amortization expense was $270.8 million in 2014 as compared to $248.4 million in 2013, an increase of $22.4 million, or nine percent, primarily due to additional transmission assets being placed in service throughout 2013 and 2014, along with an increase resulting from the amortization of the deferred pension credits regulatory liability which was fully amortized in July 2014. These were offset by the pension regulatory asset which was fully amortized in July 2013.\nAdditional Information\nAllowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction. Allowance for equity funds used during construction was $4.2 million in 2014 as compared to $6.6 million in 2013, a decrease of $2.4 million or 36.4 percent, primarily due to lower construction work in progress balances resulting from transmission projects being placed in service in 2014.\nOther Income. Other income was $4.8 million in 2014 as compared to $8.1 million in 2013, a decrease of $3.3 million or 40.7 percent, primarily due to decreased margins recognized in the guaranteed flat bill program during 2014 as a result of cooler weather in the first quarter as compared to the same period in 2013 along with a decrease in the tax gross up related to the allowance for equity funds used during construction.\nOther Expense. Other expense was $1.9 million in 2014 as compared to $4.6 million in 2013, a decrease of $2.7 million or 58.7 percent, primarily due to decreased charitable donations during 2014.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense was $141.5 million in 2014 as compared to $129.3 million in 2013, an increase of $12.2 million, or 9.4 percent, primarily due to a $9.1 million increase in interest on long-term debt related to a $250.0 million debt issuance that occurred in May 2013, a $250.0 million debt issuance that occurred in March 2014 and an additional $250.0 million debt issuance that occurred in December 2014 partially offset by the early redemption of $140.0 million senior notes in August 2014. In addition, there was a $2.0 million increase reflecting a reduction in 2013 interest expense related to tax matters offset by a decrease in the allowance for borrowed funds used during construction of $1.0 million.\nIncome Tax Expense. Income tax expense was $111.6 million in 2014 as compared to $113.5 million in 2013, a decrease of $1.9 million, or 1.7 percent. The reduction reflects lower pretax income partially offset by a reduction in state tax credits recognized during the year and an increase in Federal credits recognized.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangement\nRailcar Lease Agreement\nOG&E has several noncancellable operating leases with purchase options, covering approximately 1,400 rotary gondola railcars to transport coal from Wyoming to OG&E's coal-fired generation units. Rental payments are charged to fuel expense and are recovered through OG&E's tariffs and fuel adjustment clauses.\nOn January 11, 2012, OG&E executed a five-year lease agreement for 135 railcars to replace railcars that have been taken out of service or destroyed.\nOn October 14, 2014, OG&E signed a separate three-year lease effective December 2014 for 131 railcars to replace railcars that have been taken out of service or destroyed.\nOn December 17, 2015, OG&E renewed the lease agreement effective February 1, 2016. At the end of the new lease term, which is February 1, 2019, OG&E has the option to either purchase the railcars at a stipulated fair market value or renew the lease. If OG&E chooses not to purchase the railcars or renew the lease agreement and the actual fair value of the railcars is less than the stipulated fair market value, OG&E would be responsible for the difference in those values up to a maximum of $20.1 million. OG&E is also required to maintain all of the railcars it has under the operating lease and has entered into an agreement with a non-affiliated company to furnish this maintenance.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWorking Capital\nWorking capital is defined as the difference in current assets and current liabilities. OG&E's working capital requirements are driven generally by changes in accounts receivable, accounts payable, commodity prices, credit extended to, and the timing of collections from, customers, the level and timing of spending for maintenance and expansion activity, inventory levels and fuel recoveries.\nAdvances to Parent. The balance of Advances to Parent was $333.6 million and $215.6 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $118.0 million, or 54.7 percent, primarily due to an over recovery of fuel costs, which will be refunded to OG&E's customers.\nAccounts Receivable and Accrued Unbilled Revenues. The balance of Accounts Receivable and Accrued Unbilled Revenues was $226.6 million and $244.3 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $17.7 million, or 7.2 percent, primarily due to a decrease in billings to OG&E's retail customers.\nFuel Inventories. The balance of Fuel Inventories was $113.8 million and $58.5 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $55.3 million, or 94.5 percent, primarily due to higher coal inventory balances at OG&E's coal fired plants resulting from lower participation in the SPP Integrated Marketplace.\nDeferred Income Taxes. Deferred Income Tax assets had no balance as of December 31, 2015 compared to $170.8 million at December 31, 2014, due to a reclassification of the balance to Non-Current Deferred Income Taxes pursuant to early adoption of ASU 2015-17 Income Taxes (Topic 740)\u201d.\nFuel Clause Recoveries. The Fuel Clause balance moved from an under recovery position of $68.3 million as of December 31, 2014 to an over recovery balance of $61.3 million as of December 31, 2015, primarily due to higher amounts billed to OG&E retail customers as compared to the actual cost of fuel and purchased power. The fuel recovery clauses are designed to smooth the impact of fuel price volatility on customers' bills. As a result, OG&E under recovers fuel costs when the actual fuel and purchased power cost recoveries exceed fuel adjustment clause recoveries and over recovers fuel costs when the actual fuel and purchased power costs are below the fuel adjustment clause recoveries. Provisions in the fuel clauses are intended to allow OG&E to amortize under and over recovery balances into future cost recoveries.\nAccounts Payable. The balance of Accounts Payable was $238.2 million and $163.3 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $74.9 million, or 45.9 percent, primarily due to storm accruals and timing of vendor payments partially offset by a decrease of fuel and purchased power expense.\nLong-Term Debt Due Within One Year. The balance of Long-Term Debt Due Within One Year was $110.0 million at December 31, 2015 compared to no balance at December 31, 2014, due to the reclassification of long-term debt that will mature in January 2016.\nCash Flows\n\n* Greater than a 100 percent variance.\nOperating Activities\nThe increase of $182.8 million, or 31.1 percent, in net cash provided from operating activities in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to an increase in cash received from fuel recoveries and a decrease in payments to vendors.\nThe increase of $42.6 million, or 7.8 percent, in net cash provided from operating activities in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to:\n \u2022 the absence of fuel refunds to customers during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, partially offset by fuel under recoveries in the same period; and  \u2022an increase in cash received during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 from transmission revenue.\nThese increases were partially offset by an increase in amounts paid to vendors.\nInvesting Activities\nThe decrease of $15.7 million, or 2.8 percent, in net cash used in investing activities in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures related to transmission projects partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures related to environmental projects.\nThe decrease of $232.1 million, or 29.1 percent, in net cash used in investing activities in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to lower levels of capital expenditures due to a decrease in transmission projects.\nFinancing Activities\nThe increase of $198.5 million in net cash used in financing activities in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to the issuance of long-term debt during 2014 partially offset by:\n\u2022the payment of $140.0 million in long-term debt during 2014;\n\u2022an increase in net advances with OGE Energy during 2015; and\n\u2022a decrease in dividend payments in 2015.\nThe increase of $274.7 million in net cash used in financing activities in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to:\n \u2022 a decrease in net advances with OGE Energy during 2014 \n \u2022 the payment of $140.0 million in long-term debt; and \n \u2022 an increase in dividend payments in 2014. \nThese increases were partially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of long-term debt.\nFuture Capital Requirements and Financing Activities\nOG&E's primary needs for capital are related to acquiring or constructing new facilities and replacing or expanding existing facilities. Other working capital requirements are expected to be primarily related to maturing debt, operating lease obligations, fuel clause under and over recoveries and other general corporate purposes. OG&E generally meets its cash needs through a combination of cash generated from operations, short-term borrowings (through a combination of bank borrowings, commercial paper and borrowings from OGE Energy) and permanent financings.\nCapital Expenditures\nOG&E's estimates of capital expenditures for the years 2016 through 2020 are shown in the following table. These capital expenditures represent the base maintenance capital expenditures (i.e., capital expenditures to maintain and operate OG&E's business) plus capital expenditures for known and committed projects.\n\n (A) Typically 100kV to 299kV projects. Approximately 30 percent of revenue requirement allocated to SPP members other than OG&E. \n (B) Typically 300kV and above projects. Approximately 85 percent of revenue requirement allocated to SPP members other than OG&E. \n\n (D) Represent capital costs associated with OG&E's ECP to comply with the EPA's MATS and Regional Haze rules. More detailed discussion regarding Regional Haze and OG&E's ECP can be found in Note 13 of Notes to Financial Statements under \"Environmental Compliance Plan\" in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10-K, and under Environmental Laws and Regulations\u201d within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d under Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. On February 12, 2016, OG&E filed an application requesting the OCC to issue an order approving the \ninstallation of dry scrubbers at the Sooner facility, on or before May 2, 2016. The application states that if the application is not approved by May 2, 2016, OG&E will decide at that time whether to cancel the dry scrubber equipment and installation contracts and make plans to convert the Sooner coal units to natural gas. As of December 31, 2015, OG&E had incurred $94.8 million of construction work in progress on the dry scrubbers. OG&E estimates another $35.0 million of in-process expenditures will be incurred prior to May 1, 2016. Additionally, if the request is not approved, OG&E expects to seek recovery in subsequent proceedings for the expenditures incurred for the dry scrubber project and reasonable stranded costs associated with the discontinuance of the Sooner coal units. The capital costs in the table above do not reflect any actions or costs that may be incurred (including the conversion of the Sooner coal units) if the May 2, 2016 application is not approved.\nAdditional capital expenditures beyond those identified in the table above, including additional incremental growth opportunities in electric transmission assets, will be evaluated based upon their impact upon achieving OG&E's financial objectives.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes OG&E's contractual obligations at December 31, 2015. See OG&E's Statements of Capitalization and Note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n (A) Maturities of OG&E's long-term debt during the next five years consist of $110.2 million, $125.2 million, $250.1 million, $250.1 million and $0.1 million in years 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. \n (B) Includes expected recoveries of costs incurred for OG&E's railcar operating lease obligations, OG&E's expected cogeneration energy payments, OG&E's minimum fuel purchase commitments and OG&E's expected wind purchase commitments. \nOG&E also has 440 MWs of QF contracts to meet its current and future expected customer needs. OG&E will continue reviewing all of the supply alternatives to these QF contracts that minimize the total cost of generation to its customers, including exercising its options (if applicable) to extend these QF contracts at pre-determined rates.\nThe actual cost of fuel used in electric generation (which includes the operating lease obligations for OG&E's railcar leases shown above) and certain purchased power costs are passed through to OG&E's customers through fuel adjustment clauses. Accordingly, while the cost of fuel related to operating leases and the vast majority of minimum fuel purchase commitments of OG&E noted above may increase capital requirements, such costs are recoverable through fuel adjustment clauses and have little, if any, impact on net capital requirements and future contractual obligations. The fuel adjustment clauses are subject to periodic review by the OCC, the APSC and the FERC.\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nAt December 31, 2015, 35.5 percent of the Pension Plan investments were in listed common stocks with the balance primarily invested in U.S. Government securities, bonds, debentures and notes, and a commingled fund as presented in Note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements. In 2015, asset losses on the Pension Plan were 3.9 percent due to the losses in fixed income and equity investments. During the same time, corporate bond yields, which are used in determining the discount rate for future pension obligations, decreased. The level of funding is dependent on returns on plan assets and future discount rates. During 2015 and 2014, OGE Energy did not make any contributions to its Pension Plan. OGE Energy has not determined whether it will need to make any contributions to the Pension Plan in 2016. OGE Energy could be required to make additional contributions if the value of its pension trust and postretirement benefit plan trust assets are adversely impacted by a major market disruption in the future.\nThe following table presents the status of OG&E's portion of OGE Energy's Pension Plan, the Restoration of Retirement Income Plan and the postretirement benefit plans at December 31, 2015 and 2014. These amounts have been recorded in Accrued Benefit Obligations with the offset recorded as a regulatory asset in OG&E's Balance Sheet as discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements. The regulatory asset represents a net periodic benefit cost to be recognized in the Statements of Income in future periods.\n\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 715, \"Compensation - Retirement Benefits,\" a one-time settlement charge is required to be recorded by an organization when lump sum payments or other settlements that relieve the organization from the responsibility for the pension benefit obligation during a plan year exceed the service cost and interest cost components of the organization's net periodic pension cost. During 2015, OG&E experienced an increase in both the number of employees electing to retire and the amount of lump sum payments to be paid to such employees upon retirement. As a result, OG&E recorded pension settlement charges of $10.0 million in the third quarter and $5.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, of which $14.0 million related to OG&E's Oklahoma jurisdiction and has been included in the pension tracker. The pension settlement charge did not require a cash outlay by OG&E and did not increase OG&E's total pension expense over time, as the charges were an acceleration of costs that otherwise would be recognized as pension expense in future periods.\nSecurity Ratings\n\nAccess to reasonably priced capital is dependent in part on credit and security ratings. Generally, lower ratings lead to higher financing costs. Pricing grids associated with OGE Energy's and OG&E's credit facilities could cause annual fees and borrowing rates to increase if an adverse rating impact occurs. The impact of any future downgrade could include an increase in the costs of OGE Energy's and OG&E's short-term borrowings, but a reduction in OGE Energy's and OG&E's credit ratings would not result in any defaults or accelerations. Any future downgrade of OGE Energy or OG&E could also lead to higher long-term borrowing costs and, if below investment grade, would require OG&E to post collateral or letters of credit.\nA security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Such rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the credit rating agency and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nFuture financing requirements may be dependent, to varying degrees, upon numerous factors such as general economic conditions, abnormal weather, load growth, commodity prices, acquisitions of other businesses and/or development of projects, actions by rating agencies, inflation, changes in environmental laws or regulations, rate increases or decreases allowed by regulatory agencies, new legislation and market entry of competing electric power generators.\n2015 Capital Requirements, Sources of Financing and Financing Activities\nTotal capital requirements, consisting of capital expenditures and maturities of long-term debt, were $551.8 million and contractual obligations, net of recoveries through fuel adjustment clauses, were $84.8 million resulting in total net capital requirements and contractual obligations of $636.6 million in 2015, of which $130.6 million was to comply with environmental regulations. This compares to net capital requirements of $705.6 million and net contractual obligations of $87.4 million totaling $793.0 million in 2014, of which $31.5 million was to comply with environmental regulations.\nIn 2015, OG&E's sources of capital were cash generated from operations and proceeds from the issuance of short and long-term debt. Changes in working capital reflect the seasonal nature of OG&E's business, the revenue lag between billing and collection from customers and fuel inventories. See \"Working Capital\" for a discussion of significant changes in net working capital requirements as it pertains to operating cash flow and liquidity.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act\nDerivative instruments are utilized in managing OG&E's commodity price exposures. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for a new regulatory regime for derivatives, including mandatory clearing of certain swaps and margin requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act contains provisions that should exempt certain derivatives end-users such as OG&E from much of the clearing requirements. The regulations require that the decision on whether to use the end-user exception from mandatory clearing for derivative transactions be reviewed and approved by an \"appropriate committee\" of the Board of Directors. On January 12, 2015, President Obama signed into law an amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act that exempts from margin requirements swaps used by end-users to hedge or mitigate commercial risk. There are, however, some rulemakings that have no yet been finalized. Even if OG&E qualifies for the end-user exception to clearing and margin requirements are not imposed on end-users, its derivative counterparties may be subject to new capital, margin and business conduct requirements as a result of the new regulations, which may increase OG&E's transaction costs or make it more difficult to enter into derivative transactions on favorable terms. OG&E's inability to enter into derivative transactions on favorable terms, or at all, could increase operating expenses and put OG&E at increased exposure to risks of adverse changes in commodities prices. The impact of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act on OG&E cannot be fully determined at this time due to uncertainty over forthcoming regulations and potential changes to the derivatives markets arising from new regulatory requirements.\nFuture Sources of Financing\nManagement expects that cash generated from operations, proceeds from the issuance of long and short-term debt and funds received from OGE Energy (proceeds from OGE Energy's offerings) will be adequate over the next three years to meet anticipated cash needs and to fund future growth opportunities. OG&E utilizes short-term borrowings (through a combination of bank borrowings, commercial paper and borrowings from OGE Energy) to satisfy temporary working capital needs and as an interim source of financing capital expenditures until permanent financing is arranged.\nShort-Term Debt and Credit Facility\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014 , there were $333.6 million and $215.6 million in advances to OGE Energy. OG&E has an intercompany borrowing agreement with OGE Energy whereby OG&E has access to up to $400.0 million of OGE Energy's revolving credit amount. This agreement has a termination date of December 13, 2018. At December 31, 2015, there were no intercompany borrowings under this agreement. OG&E has a $400.0 million revolving credit facility which is available to back up OG&E's commercial paper borrowings and to provide revolving credit borrowings. This bank facility can also be used as a letter of credit facility. At December 31, 2015, there was $1.9 million supporting letters of credit at a weighted-average interest rate of 0.95 percent. There were no outstanding borrowings under this revolving credit agreement and no outstanding commercial paper borrowings at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, OG&E had $398.1 million of net available liquidity under its revolving credit agreement. OG&E has the necessary regulatory approvals to incur up to $800.0 million in short-term borrowings at any one time for a two-year period beginning January 1, 2015 and ending December 31, 2016. See Note 10 of Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of OG&E's short-term debt activity.\nIn December 2011, OG&E entered into an unsecured five-year revolving credit agreement for $400.0 million. This credit facility contained an option, which could be exercised up to two times, to extend the term for an additional year. In the third quarter of 2013, OG&E utilized one of these one-year extensions, and received consent from all of the lenders, to extend the maturity of its credit agreement from December 13, 2016 to December 13, 2017. In the second quarter of 2014, OG&E utilized its second extension to extend the maturity of its credit facility from December 13, 2017 to December 13, 2018. As of December 31,\n2015, the commitment of approximately $8.7 million of OG&E's credit facility, however, was not extended and, unless the non-extending lender is replaced in accordance with the terms of the credit facility, the commitment will expire December 13, 2017.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe Financial Statements and Notes to Financial Statements contain information that is pertinent to Management's Discussion and Analysis. In preparing the Financial Statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Changes to these assumptions and estimates could have a material effect on OG&E's Financial Statements. However, OG&E believes it has taken reasonable positions where assumptions and estimates are used in order to minimize the negative financial impact to OG&E that could result if actual results vary from the assumptions and estimates. In management's opinion, the areas of OG&E where the most significant judgment is exercised includes the determination of Pension Plan assumptions, income taxes, contingency reserves, asset retirement obligations, and depreciable lives of property, plant and equipment, the determination of regulatory assets and liabilities and unbilled revenues. The selection, application and disclosure of the following critical accounting estimates have been discussed with OGE Energy's Audit Committee. OG&E discusses its significant accounting policies, including those that do not require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates, in Note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements.\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nOGE Energy has a Pension Plan that covers a significant amount of OG&E's employees hired before December 1, 2009. Also, effective December 1, 2009, OGE Energy's Pension Plan is no longer being offered to employees hired on or after December 1, 2009. OGE Energy also has defined benefit postretirement plans that cover a significant amount of its employees. Pension and other postretirement plan expenses and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by the market value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, assumed discount rates and the level of funding. Actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized. The pension plan rate assumptions are shown in Note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements. The assumed return on plan assets is based on management's expectation of the long-term return on the plan assets portfolio. The discount rate used to compute the present value of plan liabilities is based generally on rates of high-grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which benefits will be paid. The level of funding is dependent on returns on plan assets and future discount rates. Higher returns on plan assets and an increase in discount rates will reduce funding requirements to the Pension Plan. The following table indicates the sensitivity of the Pension Plan funded status to these variables.\n\nIncome Taxes\nOG&E uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, a deferred tax asset or liability is recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities as well as tax credit carry forwards and net operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of the change.\nThe application of income tax law is complex. Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and often ambiguous. Interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time. Accordingly, it is necessary to make judgments regarding income tax exposure. As a result, changes in these judgments can materially affect amounts OG&E recognized in its financial statements. Tax positions taken by OG&E on its income tax returns that are recognized in the financial statements must satisfy a more likely than not recognition threshold, assuming that the position will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nOG&E has previously recorded asset retirement obligations that are being amortized over their respective lives ranging from three to 74 years. The inputs used in the valuation of asset retirement obligations include the assumed life of the asset placed into service, the average inflation rate, market risk premium, the credit-adjusted risk free interest rate and the timing of incurring costs related to the retirement of the asset.\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nOG&E, as a regulated utility, is subject to accounting principles for certain types of rate-regulated activities, which provide that certain incurred costs that would otherwise be charged to expense can be deferred as regulatory assets, based on the expected recovery from customers in future rates. Likewise, certain actual or anticipated credits that would otherwise reduce expense can be deferred as regulatory liabilities, based on the expected flowback to customers in future rates. Management's expected recovery of deferred costs and flowback of deferred credits generally results from specific decisions by regulators granting such ratemaking treatment.\nOG&E records certain incurred costs and obligations as regulatory assets or liabilities if, based on regulatory orders or other available evidence, it is probable that the costs or obligations will be included in amounts allowable for recovery or refund in future rates. The benefit obligations regulatory asset is comprised of expenses recorded which are probable of future recovery and that have not yet been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost, including net loss and prior service cost.\nUnbilled Revenues\nOG&E recognizes revenue from electric sales when power is delivered to customers. OG&E reads its customers' meters and sends bills to its customers throughout each month. As a result, there is a significant amount of customers' electricity consumption that has not been billed at the end of each month. OG&E accrues an estimate of the revenues for electric sales delivered since the latest billings. Unbilled revenue is presented in Accrued Unbilled Revenues on the Balance Sheets and in Operating Revenues on the Statements of Income based on estimates of usage and prices during the period. At December 31, 2015, if the estimated usage or price used in the unbilled revenue calculation were to increase or decrease by one percent, this would cause a change in the unbilled revenues recognized of $0.3 million. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, Accrued Unbilled Revenues were $53.5 million and $55.5 million, respectively. The estimates that management uses in this calculation could vary from the actual amounts to be paid by customers.\nAllowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable\nCustomer balances are generally written off if not collected within six months after the final billing date. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for OG&E is calculated by multiplying the last six months of electric revenue by the provision rate. The provision rate is based on a 12-month historical average of actual balances written off. To the extent the historical collection rates are not representative of future collections, there could be an effect on the amount of uncollectible expense recognized. Also, a portion of the uncollectible provision related to fuel within the Oklahoma jurisdiction is being recovered through the fuel adjustment clause. At December 31, 2015, if the provision rate were to increase or decrease by 10 percent, this would cause a change in the uncollectible expense recognized of $0.1 million. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is a reduction to Accounts Receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is included in the Other Operation and Maintenance Expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $1.4 million and $1.6 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nAccounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 of Notes to Financial Statements for discussion of current accounting pronouncements that are applicable to OG&E.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nIn the normal course of business, OG&E is confronted with issues or events that may result in a contingent liability. These generally relate to lawsuits or claims made by third parties, including governmental agencies. When appropriate, management consults with legal counsel and other experts to assess the claim. If, in management's opinion, OG&E has incurred a probable loss as set forth by GAAP, an estimate is made of the loss and the appropriate accounting entries are reflected in OG&E's Financial Statements. At the present time, based on available information, OG&E believes that any reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued amounts arising out of pending or threatened lawsuits or claims would not be quantitatively material to its financial\nstatements and would not have a material adverse effect on OG&E's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Notes 12 and 13 of Notes to Financial Statements and Item 3 of Part I in this Form 10-K for a discussion of OG&E's commitments and contingencies.\nEnvironmental Laws and Regulations\nThe activities of OG&E are subject to numerous stringent and complex Federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection. These laws and regulations can change, restrict or otherwise impact OG&E's business activities in many ways including the handling or disposal of waste material, future construction activities to avoid or mitigate harm to threatened or endangered species and requiring the installation and operation of emissions pollution control equipment. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. OG&E believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with current Federal, state and local environmental standards.\nEnvironmental regulation can increase the cost of planning, design, initial installation and operation of OG&E's facilities. Historically, OG&E's total expenditures for environmental control facilities and for remediation have not been significant in relation to its financial position or results of operations. OG&E believes, however, that it is likely that the trend in environmental legislation and regulations will continue towards more restrictive standards. Compliance with these standards is expected to increase the cost of conducting business. Management continues to evaluate its compliance with existing and proposed environmental legislation and regulations and implement appropriate environmental programs in a competitive market.\nOG&E expects that environmental expenditures necessary to comply with the environmental laws and regulations discussed below will qualify as part of a pre-approval plan to handle state and Federally mandated environmental upgrades which will be recoverable in Oklahoma from OG&E's retail customers under House Bill 1910, which was enacted into law in May 2005.\nIt is estimated that OG&E's total expenditures to comply with environmental laws, regulations and requirements for 2016 will be $195.9 million, of which $178.3 million is for capital expenditures. It is estimated that OG&E's total expenditures to comply with environmental laws, regulations and requirements for 2017 will be approximately $166.7 million, of which $148.7 million is for capital expenditures. The amounts above include capital expenditures for low NOX burners and dry scrubbers.\nAir\nFederal Clean Air Act Overview\nOG&E's operations are subject to the Federal Clean Air Act as amended, and comparable state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including electric generating units, and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. Such laws and regulations may require that OG&E obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions or result in the increase of existing air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations or install emission control equipment. OG&E likely will be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment and technology in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions.\nRegional Haze Control Measures\nThe EPA's 2005 regional haze rule is intended to protect visibility in certain national parks and wilderness areas throughout the United States that may be impacted by air pollutant emissions.\nOn February 18,", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIntroduction\nOG&E generates, transmits, distributes and sells electric energy in Oklahoma and western Arkansas. Its operations are subject to regulation by the OCC, the APSC and the FERC. OG&E was incorporated in 1902 under the laws of the Oklahoma Territory. OG&E is the largest electric utility in Oklahoma and its franchised service territory includes Fort Smith, Arkansas and the surrounding communities. OG&E sold its retail natural gas business in 1928 and is no longer engaged in the natural gas distribution business. OG&E is a wholly-owned subsidiary of OGE Energy, an energy and energy services provider offering physical delivery and related services for both electricity and natural gas primarily in the south central United States.\nOverview\nOG&E Mission and Focus\nOGE Energy's mission, through OG&E and its equity interest in Enable, is to fulfill its critical role in the nation's electric utility and natural gas midstream pipeline infrastructure and meet individual customers' needs for energy and related services focusing on safety, efficiency, reliability, customer service and risk management.\nOG&E is focused on:\n \u2022 Providing exceptional customer experiences by continuing to improve customer interfaces, tools, products and services that deliver high customer satisfaction and operating productivity. \n \u2022 Providing safe, reliable energy to the communities and customers we serve. A particular focus is on enhancing the value of the grid by improving distribution grid reliability by reducing the frequency and duration of customer interruptions and leveraging previous grid technology investments. \n \u2022 Maintaining strong regulatory and legislative relationships for the long-term benefit of our customers, investors and members. \n \u2022 Continuing to grow a zero-injury culture and deliver top-quartile safety results. \n \u2022 Complying with the EPA's MATS and Regional Haze requirements. \n \u2022 Ensuring we have the necessary mix of generation resources to meet the long-term needs of our customers. \n \u2022 Continuing focus on operational excellence and efficiencies in order to protect the customer bill. \nSummary of Operating Results\n2015 compared to 2014. OG&E reported net income of $268.9 million and $292.0 million, respectively, in 2015 and 2014, a decrease of $23.1 million, or 7.9 percent, primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense due to additional assets being placed in service in 2015, and a decrease in gross margin related to milder weather and decreased wholesale transmission revenues. Partially offsetting these items was an increase in customer growth, an increase in other income and an increase in allowance for equity funds used during construction.\n2014 compared to 2013. OG&E reported net income of $292.0 million and $292.6 million, respectively, in 2014 and 2013, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 0.2 percent, reflecting an increase in depreciation expense due to additional assets being placed in service in 2014, a decrease in gross margin related to milder weather compared to 2013, an increase in other operation and maintenance expense and an increase in interest expense related to the issuance of debt. Partially offsetting these items was an increase in wholesale transmission revenues, an increase in customer growth and a decrease in incentive compensation.\n2016 Outlook\nOG&E projects to earn approximately $288 million to $300 million or $1.44 to $1.50 per average diluted share in 2016 and is based on the following assumptions:\n \u2022 normal weather patterns are experienced for the remainder of the year; \n \u2022 new rates take effect in Oklahoma in mid 2016; \n \u2022 gross margin on revenues of approximately $1.405 billion to $1.415 billion based on sales growth of approximately one percent on a weather-adjusted basis; \n \u2022 approximately $106 million of gross margin is primarily attributed to regionally allocated transmission projects; \n \u2022 operating expenses of approximately $885 million to $895 million, with operation and maintenance expenses comprising 54 percent of the total; \n \u2022 interest expense of approximately $140 million which assumes a $8 million allowance for borrowed funds used during construction reduction to interest expense; \n \u2022 other income of approximately $27 million including approximately $15 million of allowance for equity funds used during construction; and \n \u2022 an effective tax rate of approximately 28 percent. \nOG&E has significant seasonality in its earnings. OG&E typically shows minimal earnings in the first and fourth quarters with a majority of earnings in the third quarter due to the seasonal nature of air conditioning demand.\nGross margin is defined by OG&E as operating revenues less fuel, purchased power and certain transmission expenses. Gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes depreciation and amortization, and other operation and maintenance expenses. Expenses for fuel and purchased power are recovered through fuel adjustment clauses and as a result changes in these expenses are offset in operating revenues with no impact on net income. OG&E believes gross margin provides a more meaningful basis for evaluating its operations across periods than operating revenues because gross margin excludes the revenue effect of fluctuations in these expenses. Gross margin is used internally to measure performance against budget and in reports for management and the Board of Directors. OG&E's definition of gross margin may be different from similar terms used by other companies.\nReconciliation of gross margin to revenue:\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in Millions)\n</td> <td>2016\n(A)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales\n</td> <td>752\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross Margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (A) Based on the midpoint of OG&E earnings guidance for 2016. \nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis presents factors that affected OG&E's results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 and OG&E's financial position at December 31, 2015 and 2014.

If the calculated average is above 65 degrees, then the difference between the calculated average and 65 is expressed as cooling degree days, with each degree of difference equaling one cooling degree day. If the calculated average is below 65 degrees, then the difference between the calculated average and 65 is expressed as heating degree days, with each degree of difference equaling one heating degree day. The daily calculations are then totaled for the particular reporting period. \n2015 compared to 2014. OG&E's net income decreased $23.1 million, or 7.9 percent, in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to higher depreciation expense and lower gross margin partially offset by higher other income and an increase in allowance for equity funds used in construction.\nGross Margin\nOperating revenues were $2,196.9 million in 2015 as compared to $2,453.1 million in 2014, a decrease of $256.2 million, or 10.4 percent. Cost of sales were $865.0 million in 2015 as compared to $1,106.6 million in 2014, a decrease of $241.6 million, or 21.8 percent. Gross margin was $1,331.9 million in 2015 as compared to $1,346.5 million in 2014, a decrease of $14.6 million, or 1.1 percent. The below factors contributed to the change in gross margin:\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quantity variance (primarily weather) (A)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(25.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale transmission revenue (B)\n</td> <td>(19.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expiration of AVEC contract (C)\n</td> <td>(11.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial and oilfield sales\n</td> <td>(4.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-residential demand and related revenues\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Price Variance (D)\n</td> <td>19.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New customer growth\n</td> <td>21.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in gross margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(14.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (A) The overall cooling degree days decreased two percent in 2015 compared to 2014 with August decreasing by 14 percent. \n (B) Decreased primarily due to a true up for the base plan projects in the SPP formula rate for 2014 and 2015 as well as a reduction in the point-to-point credits shared with retail customers. \n (C) On June 30, 2015, the wholesale power contract with AVEC expired. \n (D) Increased primarily due to sales and customer mix. \nCost of sales for OG&E consists of fuel used in electric generation, purchased power and transmission related charges. Fuel expense was $458.5 million in 2015 as compared to $627.5 million in 2014, a decrease of $169.0 million, or 26.9 percent, primarily due to lower natural gas prices offset by higher natural gas used. In 2015, OG&E's fuel mix was 49 percent coal, 44 percent natural gas and seven percent wind. In 2014, OG&E's fuel mix was 61 percent coal, 32 percent natural gas and seven percent wind. Purchased power costs were $362.6 million in 2015 as compared to $444.1 million in 2014, a decrease of $81.5 million, or 18.4 percent, primarily due to a decrease in purchases from the SPP, reflecting the impact of OG&E's participation in the SPP Integrated Marketplace, which began on March 1, 2014. Transmission related charges were $43.9 million in 2015 as compared to $35.0 million in 2014, an increase of $8.9 million, or 25.4 percent, primarily due to higher SPP charges for the base plan projects of other utilities.\nThe actual cost of fuel used in electric generation and certain purchased power costs are passed through to OG&E's customers through fuel adjustment clauses. The fuel adjustment clauses are subject to periodic review by the OCC, the APSC and the FERC. The OCC, the APSC and the FERC have authority to review the appropriateness of gas transportation charges or other fees OG&E pays to its affiliate, Enable.\nOperating Expenses\nOther operation and maintenance expenses were $444.5 million in 2015 as compared to $453.2 million in 2014, a decrease of $8.7 million, or 1.9 percent. The below factors contributed to the change in other operations and maintenance expense:\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Additional capitalized labor (A)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance at power plants (B)\n</td> <td>(7.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional service contracts (C)\n</td> <td>(2.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee benefits (D)\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other marketing, sales and commercial (E)\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries and wages (F)\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in other operation and maintenance expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (A) Decreased primarily due to more capital projects and storm costs exceeding the $2.7 million threshold, which were moved to a regulatory asset. \n (B) Decreased primarily due to less work at the power plants. \n (C) Decreased primarily due to decreased engineering services. \n (D) Increased primarily due to higher medical costs incurred partially offset by lower pension costs. \n (E) Increased primarily due to higher demand side management customer payments. \n (F) Increased primarily due to annual salary increases and increased overtime related to storms. \nDepreciation and amortization expense was $299.9 million in 2015 as compared to $270.8 million in 2014, an increase of $29.1 million, or 10.7 percent, primarily due to additional assets being placed in service, along with an increase resulting from the amortization of deferred pension credits and post-retirement medical regulatory liabilities which were fully amortized in July 2014 and amortization of deferred storm costs.\nAdditional Information\nAllowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction. Allowance for equity funds used during construction was $8.3 million in 2015 as compared to $4.2 million in 2014, an increase of $4.1 million, or 97.6 percent, primarily due to higher construction work in progress balances resulting from increased spending for environmental projects.\nOther Income. Other income was $13.3 million in 2015 as compared to $4.8 million in 2014, an increase of $8.5 million, primarily due to increased guaranteed flat bill margins and an increase in the tax gross up related to higher allowance for funds used during construction.\nIncome Tax Expense. Income tax expense was $104.8 million in 2015 as compared to $111.6 million in 2014, a decrease of $6.8 million, or 6.1 percent, primarily due to lower pretax income partially offset by a reduction in Federal tax credits.\n2014 compared to 2013. OG&E's net income decreased $0.6 million, or 0.2 percent, in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to higher gross margin, which was almost offset by higher other operations and maintenance expense, higher depreciation and amortization expense, and interest expense.\nGross Margin\nOperating revenues were $2,453.1 million in 2014 as compared to $2,262.2 million in 2013, an increase of $190.9 million, or 8.4 percent. Cost of sales were $1,106.6 million in 2014 as compared to $965.9 million in 2013, an increase of $140.7 million, or 14.6 percent. Gross margin was $1,346.5 million in 2014 as compared to $1,296.3 million in 2013, an increase of $50.2 million, or 3.9 percent.

Fuel expense was $627.5 million in 2014 as compared to $672.7 million in 2013, a decrease of $45.2 million, or 6.7 percent, primarily due to lower natural gas used offset by higher natural gas prices. In 2014, OG&E's fuel mix was 61 percent coal, 32 percent natural gas and seven percent wind. In 2013, OG&E's fuel mix was 53 percent coal, 40 percent natural gas and seven percent wind. Purchased power costs were $444.1 million in 2014 as compared to $267.6 million in 2013, an increase of $176.5 million, or 66 percent, primarily due to an increase in purchases from the SPP, reflecting the impact of OG&E's participation in the SPP Integrated Marketplace, which began on March 1, 2014. Transmission related charges were $35.0 million in 2014 as compared to $25.6 million in 2013, an increase of $9.4 million, or 36.7 percent, primarily due to higher SPP charges for the base plan projects of other utilities.\nOperating Expenses\nOther operation and maintenance expenses were $453.2 million in 2014 as compared to $438.8 million in 2013, an increase of $14.4 million, or 3.3 percent.

These were offset by the pension regulatory asset which was fully amortized in July 2013.\nAdditional Information\nAllowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction. Allowance for equity funds used during construction was $4.2 million in 2014 as compared to $6.6 million in 2013, a decrease of $2.4 million or 36.4 percent, primarily due to lower construction work in progress balances resulting from transmission projects being placed in service in 2014.\nOther Income. Other income was $4.8 million in 2014 as compared to $8.1 million in 2013, a decrease of $3.3 million or 40.7 percent, primarily due to decreased margins recognized in the guaranteed flat bill program during 2014 as a result of cooler weather in the first quarter as compared to the same period in 2013 along with a decrease in the tax gross up related to the allowance for equity funds used during construction.\nOther Expense. Other expense was $1.9 million in 2014 as compared to $4.6 million in 2013, a decrease of $2.7 million or 58.7 percent, primarily due to decreased charitable donations during 2014.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense was $141.5 million in 2014 as compared to $129.3 million in 2013, an increase of $12.2 million, or 9.4 percent, primarily due to a $9.1 million increase in interest on long-term debt related to a $250.0 million debt issuance that occurred in May 2013, a $250.0 million debt issuance that occurred in March 2014 and an additional $250.0 million debt issuance that occurred in December 2014 partially offset by the early redemption of $140.0 million senior notes in August 2014. In addition, there was a $2.0 million increase reflecting a reduction in 2013 interest expense related to tax matters offset by a decrease in the allowance for borrowed funds used during construction of $1.0 million.\nIncome Tax Expense. Income tax expense was $111.6 million in 2014 as compared to $113.5 million in 2013, a decrease of $1.9 million, or 1.7 percent. The reduction reflects lower pretax income partially offset by a reduction in state tax credits recognized during the year and an increase in Federal credits recognized.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangement\nRailcar Lease Agreement\nOG&E has several noncancellable operating leases with purchase options, covering approximately 1,400 rotary gondola railcars to transport coal from Wyoming to OG&E's coal-fired generation units. Rental payments are charged to fuel expense and are recovered through OG&E's tariffs and fuel adjustment clauses.\nOn January 11, 2012, OG&E executed a five-year lease agreement for 135 railcars to replace railcars that have been taken out of service or destroyed.\nOn October 14, 2014, OG&E signed a separate three-year lease effective December 2014 for 131 railcars to replace railcars that have been taken out of service or destroyed.\nOn December 17, 2015, OG&E renewed the lease agreement effective February 1, 2016. At the end of the new lease term, which is February 1, 2019, OG&E has the option to either purchase the railcars at a stipulated fair market value or renew the lease. If OG&E chooses not to purchase the railcars or renew the lease agreement and the actual fair value of the railcars is less than the stipulated fair market value, OG&E would be responsible for the difference in those values up to a maximum of $20.1 million. OG&E is also required to maintain all of the railcars it has under the operating lease and has entered into an agreement with a non-affiliated company to furnish this maintenance.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWorking Capital\nWorking capital is defined as the difference in current assets and current liabilities. OG&E's working capital requirements are driven generally by changes in accounts receivable, accounts payable, commodity prices, credit extended to, and the timing of collections from, customers, the level and timing of spending for maintenance and expansion activity, inventory levels and fuel recoveries.\nAdvances to Parent. The balance of Advances to Parent was $333.6 million and $215.6 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $118.0 million, or 54.7 percent, primarily due to an over recovery of fuel costs, which will be refunded to OG&E's customers.\nAccounts Receivable and Accrued Unbilled Revenues. The balance of Accounts Receivable and Accrued Unbilled Revenues was $226.6 million and $244.3 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $17.7 million, or 7.2 percent, primarily due to a decrease in billings to OG&E's retail customers.\nFuel Inventories. The balance of Fuel Inventories was $113.8 million and $58.5 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $55.3 million, or 94.5 percent, primarily due to higher coal inventory balances at OG&E's coal fired plants resulting from lower participation in the SPP Integrated Marketplace.\nDeferred Income Taxes. Deferred Income Tax assets had no balance as of December 31, 2015 compared to $170.8 million at December 31, 2014, due to a reclassification of the balance to Non-Current Deferred Income Taxes pursuant to early adoption of ASU 2015-17 Income Taxes (Topic 740)\u201d.\nFuel Clause Recoveries. The Fuel Clause balance moved from an under recovery position of $68.3 million as of December 31, 2014 to an over recovery balance of $61.3 million as of December 31, 2015, primarily due to higher amounts billed to OG&E retail customers as compared to the actual cost of fuel and purchased power. The fuel recovery clauses are designed to smooth the impact of fuel price volatility on customers' bills. As a result, OG&E under recovers fuel costs when the actual fuel and purchased power cost recoveries exceed fuel adjustment clause recoveries and over recovers fuel costs when the actual fuel and purchased power costs are below the fuel adjustment clause recoveries. Provisions in the fuel clauses are intended to allow OG&E to amortize under and over recovery balances into future cost recoveries.\nAccounts Payable. The balance of Accounts Payable was $238.2 million and $163.3 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $74.9 million, or 45.9 percent, primarily due to storm accruals and timing of vendor payments partially offset by a decrease of fuel and purchased power expense.\nLong-Term Debt Due Within One Year. The balance of Long-Term Debt Due Within One Year was $110.0 million at December 31, 2015 compared to no balance at December 31, 2014, due to the reclassification of long-term debt that will mature in January 2016.\nCash Flows\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>2014 vs. 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31 (In millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided from operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>770.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>587.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>545.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>182.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(549.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(564.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(796.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>15.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>232.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided from financing activities\n</td> <td>(221.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(23.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>251.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(198.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(274.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Greater than a 100 percent variance.\nOperating Activities\nThe increase of $182.8 million, or 31.1 percent, in net cash provided from operating activities in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to an increase in cash received from fuel recoveries and a decrease in payments to vendors.\nThe increase of $42.6 million, or 7.8 percent, in net cash provided from operating activities in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to:\n \u2022 the absence of fuel refunds to customers during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, partially offset by fuel under recoveries in the same period; and  \u2022an increase in cash received during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 from transmission revenue.\nThese increases were partially offset by an increase in amounts paid to vendors.\nInvesting Activities\nThe decrease of $15.7 million, or 2.8 percent, in net cash used in investing activities in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures related to transmission projects partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures related to environmental projects.\nThe decrease of $232.1 million, or 29.1 percent, in net cash used in investing activities in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to lower levels of capital expenditures due to a decrease in transmission projects.\nFinancing Activities\nThe increase of $198.5 million in net cash used in financing activities in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to the issuance of long-term debt during 2014 partially offset by:\n\u2022the payment of $140.0 million in long-term debt during 2014;\n\u2022an increase in net advances with OGE Energy during 2015; and\n\u2022a decrease in dividend payments in 2015.\nThe increase of $274.7 million in net cash used in financing activities in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to:\n \u2022 a decrease in net advances with OGE Energy during 2014 \n \u2022 the payment of $140.0 million in long-term debt; and \n \u2022 an increase in dividend payments in 2014. \nThese increases were partially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of long-term debt.\nFuture Capital Requirements and Financing Activities\nOG&E's primary needs for capital are related to acquiring or constructing new facilities and replacing or expanding existing facilities. Other working capital requirements are expected to be primarily related to maturing debt, operating lease obligations, fuel clause under and over recoveries and other general corporate purposes. OG&E generally meets its cash needs through a combination of cash generated from operations, short-term borrowings (through a combination of bank borrowings, commercial paper and borrowings from OGE Energy) and permanent financings.\nCapital Expenditures\nOG&E's estimates of capital expenditures for the years 2016 through 2020 are shown in the following table. These capital expenditures represent the base maintenance capital expenditures (i.e., capital expenditures to maintain and operate OG&E's business) plus capital expenditures for known and committed projects.\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Base Transmission\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Base Distribution\n</td> <td>190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Base Generation\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Base Transmission, Distribution, Generation and Other\n</td> <td>340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>305\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Known and Committed Projects:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transmission Projects:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Regionally Allocated Projects (A)\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Large SPP Integrated Transmission Projects (B) (C)\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Transmission Projects\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Projects:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental - low NOX burners (D)\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental - dry scrubbers (D)\n</td> <td>150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combustion turbines - Mustang\n</td> <td>180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental - natural gas conversion (D)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Other Projects\n</td> <td>350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Known and Committed Projects\n</td> <td>420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>325\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (A) Typically 100kV to 299kV projects.

On February 12, 2016, OG&E filed an application requesting the OCC to issue an order approving the \ninstallation of dry scrubbers at the Sooner facility, on or before May 2, 2016. The application states that if the application is not approved by May 2, 2016, OG&E will decide at that time whether to cancel the dry scrubber equipment and installation contracts and make plans to convert the Sooner coal units to natural gas. As of December 31, 2015, OG&E had incurred $94.8 million of construction work in progress on the dry scrubbers. OG&E estimates another $35.0 million of in-process expenditures will be incurred prior to May 1, 2016. Additionally, if the request is not approved, OG&E expects to seek recovery in subsequent proceedings for the expenditures incurred for the dry scrubber project and reasonable stranded costs associated with the discontinuance of the Sooner coal units. The capital costs in the table above do not reflect any actions or costs that may be incurred (including the conversion of the Sooner coal units) if the May 2, 2016 application is not approved.\nAdditional capital expenditures beyond those identified in the table above, including additional incremental growth opportunities in electric transmission assets, will be evaluated based upon their impact upon achieving OG&E's financial objectives.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes OG&E's contractual obligations at December 31, 2015.

OG&E will continue reviewing all of the supply alternatives to these QF contracts that minimize the total cost of generation to its customers, including exercising its options (if applicable) to extend these QF contracts at pre-determined rates.\nThe actual cost of fuel used in electric generation (which includes the operating lease obligations for OG&E's railcar leases shown above) and certain purchased power costs are passed through to OG&E's customers through fuel adjustment clauses. Accordingly, while the cost of fuel related to operating leases and the vast majority of minimum fuel purchase commitments of OG&E noted above may increase capital requirements, such costs are recoverable through fuel adjustment clauses and have little, if any, impact on net capital requirements and future contractual obligations. The fuel adjustment clauses are subject to periodic review by the OCC, the APSC and the FERC.\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nAt December 31, 2015, 35.5 percent of the Pension Plan investments were in listed common stocks with the balance primarily invested in U.S. Government securities, bonds, debentures and notes, and a commingled fund as presented in Note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements. In 2015, asset losses on the Pension Plan were 3.9 percent due to the losses in fixed income and equity investments. During the same time, corporate bond yields, which are used in determining the discount rate for future pension obligations, decreased. The level of funding is dependent on returns on plan assets and future discount rates. During 2015 and 2014, OGE Energy did not make any contributions to its Pension Plan. OGE Energy has not determined whether it will need to make any contributions to the Pension Plan in 2016. OGE Energy could be required to make additional contributions if the value of its pension trust and postretirement benefit plan trust assets are adversely impacted by a major market disruption in the future.\nThe following table presents the status of OG&E's portion of OGE Energy's Pension Plan, the Restoration of Retirement Income Plan and the postretirement benefit plans at December 31, 2015 and 2014. These amounts have been recorded in Accrued Benefit Obligations with the offset recorded as a regulatory asset in OG&E's Balance Sheet as discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements. The regulatory asset represents a net periodic benefit cost to be recognized in the Statements of Income in future periods.\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Pension Plan\n</td> <td>Restoration of Retirement\nIncome Plan\n</td> <td>Postretirement\nBenefit Plans\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31 (In millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefit obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>514.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>543.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>176.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>217.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value of plan assets\n</td> <td>464.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>532.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funded status at end of year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(50.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(126.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(163.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 715, \"Compensation - Retirement Benefits,\" a one-time settlement charge is required to be recorded by an organization when lump sum payments or other settlements that relieve the organization from the responsibility for the pension benefit obligation during a plan year exceed the service cost and interest cost components of the organization's net periodic pension cost. During 2015, OG&E experienced an increase in both the number of employees electing to retire and the amount of lump sum payments to be paid to such employees upon retirement. As a result, OG&E recorded pension settlement charges of $10.0 million in the third quarter and $5.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, of which $14.0 million related to OG&E's Oklahoma jurisdiction and has been included in the pension tracker. The pension settlement charge did not require a cash outlay by OG&E and did not increase OG&E's total pension expense over time, as the charges were an acceleration of costs that otherwise would be recognized as pension expense in future periods.\nSecurity Ratings\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Moody's Investors Services\n</td> <td>Standard & Poor's Ratings Services\n</td> <td>Fitch Ratings\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Notes\n</td> <td>A1\n</td> <td>A-\n</td> <td>A+\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccess to reasonably priced capital is dependent in part on credit and security ratings. Generally, lower ratings lead to higher financing costs. Pricing grids associated with OGE Energy's and OG&E's credit facilities could cause annual fees and borrowing rates to increase if an adverse rating impact occurs. The impact of any future downgrade could include an increase in the costs of OGE Energy's and OG&E's short-term borrowings, but a reduction in OGE Energy's and OG&E's credit ratings would not result in any defaults or accelerations. Any future downgrade of OGE Energy or OG&E could also lead to higher long-term borrowing costs and, if below investment grade, would require OG&E to post collateral or letters of credit.\nA security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Such rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the credit rating agency and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nFuture financing requirements may be dependent, to varying degrees, upon numerous factors such as general economic conditions, abnormal weather, load growth, commodity prices, acquisitions of other businesses and/or development of projects, actions by rating agencies, inflation, changes in environmental laws or regulations, rate increases or decreases allowed by regulatory agencies, new legislation and market entry of competing electric power generators.\n2015 Capital Requirements, Sources of Financing and Financing Activities\nTotal capital requirements, consisting of capital expenditures and maturities of long-term debt, were $551.8 million and contractual obligations, net of recoveries through fuel adjustment clauses, were $84.8 million resulting in total net capital requirements and contractual obligations of $636.6 million in 2015, of which $130.6 million was to comply with environmental regulations. This compares to net capital requirements of $705.6 million and net contractual obligations of $87.4 million totaling $793.0 million in 2014, of which $31.5 million was to comply with environmental regulations.\nIn 2015, OG&E's sources of capital were cash generated from operations and proceeds from the issuance of short and long-term debt. Changes in working capital reflect the seasonal nature of OG&E's business, the revenue lag between billing and collection from customers and fuel inventories. See \"Working Capital\" for a discussion of significant changes in net working capital requirements as it pertains to operating cash flow and liquidity.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act\nDerivative instruments are utilized in managing OG&E's commodity price exposures. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for a new regulatory regime for derivatives, including mandatory clearing of certain swaps and margin requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act contains provisions that should exempt certain derivatives end-users such as OG&E from much of the clearing requirements. The regulations require that the decision on whether to use the end-user exception from mandatory clearing for derivative transactions be reviewed and approved by an \"appropriate committee\" of the Board of Directors. On January 12, 2015, President Obama signed into law an amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act that exempts from margin requirements swaps used by end-users to hedge or mitigate commercial risk. There are, however, some rulemakings that have no yet been finalized. Even if OG&E qualifies for the end-user exception to clearing and margin requirements are not imposed on end-users, its derivative counterparties may be subject to new capital, margin and business conduct requirements as a result of the new regulations, which may increase OG&E's transaction costs or make it more difficult to enter into derivative transactions on favorable terms. OG&E's inability to enter into derivative transactions on favorable terms, or at all, could increase operating expenses and put OG&E at increased exposure to risks of adverse changes in commodities prices. The impact of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act on OG&E cannot be fully determined at this time due to uncertainty over forthcoming regulations and potential changes to the derivatives markets arising from new regulatory requirements.\nFuture Sources of Financing\nManagement expects that cash generated from operations, proceeds from the issuance of long and short-term debt and funds received from OGE Energy (proceeds from OGE Energy's offerings) will be adequate over the next three years to meet anticipated cash needs and to fund future growth opportunities. OG&E utilizes short-term borrowings (through a combination of bank borrowings, commercial paper and borrowings from OGE Energy) to satisfy temporary working capital needs and as an interim source of financing capital expenditures until permanent financing is arranged.\nShort-Term Debt and Credit Facility\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014 , there were $333.6 million and $215.6 million in advances to OGE Energy. OG&E has an intercompany borrowing agreement with OGE Energy whereby OG&E has access to up to $400.0 million of OGE Energy's revolving credit amount. This agreement has a termination date of December 13, 2018. At December 31, 2015, there were no intercompany borrowings under this agreement. OG&E has a $400.0 million revolving credit facility which is available to back up OG&E's commercial paper borrowings and to provide revolving credit borrowings. This bank facility can also be used as a letter of credit facility. At December 31, 2015, there was $1.9 million supporting letters of credit at a weighted-average interest rate of 0.95 percent. There were no outstanding borrowings under this revolving credit agreement and no outstanding commercial paper borrowings at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, OG&E had $398.1 million of net available liquidity under its revolving credit agreement. OG&E has the necessary regulatory approvals to incur up to $800.0 million in short-term borrowings at any one time for a two-year period beginning January 1, 2015 and ending December 31, 2016. See Note 10 of Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of OG&E's short-term debt activity.\nIn December 2011, OG&E entered into an unsecured five-year revolving credit agreement for $400.0 million. This credit facility contained an option, which could be exercised up to two times, to extend the term for an additional year. In the third quarter of 2013, OG&E utilized one of these one-year extensions, and received consent from all of the lenders, to extend the maturity of its credit agreement from December 13, 2016 to December 13, 2017. In the second quarter of 2014, OG&E utilized its second extension to extend the maturity of its credit facility from December 13, 2017 to December 13, 2018. As of December 31,\n2015, the commitment of approximately $8.7 million of OG&E's credit facility, however, was not extended and, unless the non-extending lender is replaced in accordance with the terms of the credit facility, the commitment will expire December 13, 2017.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe Financial Statements and Notes to Financial Statements contain information that is pertinent to Management's Discussion and Analysis. In preparing the Financial Statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Changes to these assumptions and estimates could have a material effect on OG&E's Financial Statements. However, OG&E believes it has taken reasonable positions where assumptions and estimates are used in order to minimize the negative financial impact to OG&E that could result if actual results vary from the assumptions and estimates. In management's opinion, the areas of OG&E where the most significant judgment is exercised includes the determination of Pension Plan assumptions, income taxes, contingency reserves, asset retirement obligations, and depreciable lives of property, plant and equipment, the determination of regulatory assets and liabilities and unbilled revenues. The selection, application and disclosure of the following critical accounting estimates have been discussed with OGE Energy's Audit Committee. OG&E discusses its significant accounting policies, including those that do not require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates, in Note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements.\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nOGE Energy has a Pension Plan that covers a significant amount of OG&E's employees hired before December 1, 2009. Also, effective December 1, 2009, OGE Energy's Pension Plan is no longer being offered to employees hired on or after December 1, 2009. OGE Energy also has defined benefit postretirement plans that cover a significant amount of its employees. Pension and other postretirement plan expenses and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by the market value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, assumed discount rates and the level of funding. Actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized. The pension plan rate assumptions are shown in Note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements. The assumed return on plan assets is based on management's expectation of the long-term return on the plan assets portfolio. The discount rate used to compute the present value of plan liabilities is based generally on rates of high-grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which benefits will be paid. The level of funding is dependent on returns on plan assets and future discount rates. Higher returns on plan assets and an increase in discount rates will reduce funding requirements to the Pension Plan. The following table indicates the sensitivity of the Pension Plan funded status to these variables.\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>Impact on Funded Status\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Actual plan asset returns\n</td> <td>+/- 1 percent\n</td> <td>+/- $5.8 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>+/- 0.25 percent\n</td> <td>+/- $14.1 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contributions\n</td> <td>+/- $10 million\n</td> <td>+/- $10.0 million\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes\nOG&E uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, a deferred tax asset or liability is recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities as well as tax credit carry forwards and net operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of the change.\nThe application of income tax law is complex. Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and often ambiguous. Interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time. Accordingly, it is necessary to make judgments regarding income tax exposure. As a result, changes in these judgments can materially affect amounts OG&E recognized in its financial statements. Tax positions taken by OG&E on its income tax returns that are recognized in the financial statements must satisfy a more likely than not recognition threshold, assuming that the position will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nOG&E has previously recorded asset retirement obligations that are being amortized over their respective lives ranging from three to 74 years. The inputs used in the valuation of asset retirement obligations include the assumed life of the asset placed into service, the average inflation rate, market risk premium, the credit-adjusted risk free interest rate and the timing of incurring costs related to the retirement of the asset.\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nOG&E, as a regulated utility, is subject to accounting principles for certain types of rate-regulated activities, which provide that certain incurred costs that would otherwise be charged to expense can be deferred as regulatory assets, based on the expected recovery from customers in future rates. Likewise, certain actual or anticipated credits that would otherwise reduce expense can be deferred as regulatory liabilities, based on the expected flowback to customers in future rates. Management's expected recovery of deferred costs and flowback of deferred credits generally results from specific decisions by regulators granting such ratemaking treatment.\nOG&E records certain incurred costs and obligations as regulatory assets or liabilities if, based on regulatory orders or other available evidence, it is probable that the costs or obligations will be included in amounts allowable for recovery or refund in future rates. The benefit obligations regulatory asset is comprised of expenses recorded which are probable of future recovery and that have not yet been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost, including net loss and prior service cost.\nUnbilled Revenues\nOG&E recognizes revenue from electric sales when power is delivered to customers. OG&E reads its customers' meters and sends bills to its customers throughout each month. As a result, there is a significant amount of customers' electricity consumption that has not been billed at the end of each month. OG&E accrues an estimate of the revenues for electric sales delivered since the latest billings. Unbilled revenue is presented in Accrued Unbilled Revenues on the Balance Sheets and in Operating Revenues on the Statements of Income based on estimates of usage and prices during the period. At December 31, 2015, if the estimated usage or price used in the unbilled revenue calculation were to increase or decrease by one percent, this would cause a change in the unbilled revenues recognized of $0.3 million. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, Accrued Unbilled Revenues were $53.5 million and $55.5 million, respectively. The estimates that management uses in this calculation could vary from the actual amounts to be paid by customers.\nAllowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable\nCustomer balances are generally written off if not collected within six months after the final billing date. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for OG&E is calculated by multiplying the last six months of electric revenue by the provision rate. The provision rate is based on a 12-month historical average of actual balances written off. To the extent the historical collection rates are not representative of future collections, there could be an effect on the amount of uncollectible expense recognized. Also, a portion of the uncollectible provision related to fuel within the Oklahoma jurisdiction is being recovered through the fuel adjustment clause. At December 31, 2015, if the provision rate were to increase or decrease by 10 percent, this would cause a change in the uncollectible expense recognized of $0.1 million. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is a reduction to Accounts Receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is included in the Other Operation and Maintenance Expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $1.4 million and $1.6 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nAccounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 of Notes to Financial Statements for discussion of current accounting pronouncements that are applicable to OG&E.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nIn the normal course of business, OG&E is confronted with issues or events that may result in a contingent liability. These generally relate to lawsuits or claims made by third parties, including governmental agencies. When appropriate, management consults with legal counsel and other experts to assess the claim. If, in management's opinion, OG&E has incurred a probable loss as set forth by GAAP, an estimate is made of the loss and the appropriate accounting entries are reflected in OG&E's Financial Statements. At the present time, based on available information, OG&E believes that any reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued amounts arising out of pending or threatened lawsuits or claims would not be quantitatively material to its financial\nstatements and would not have a material adverse effect on OG&E's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Notes 12 and 13 of Notes to Financial Statements and Item 3 of Part I in this Form 10-K for a discussion of OG&E's commitments and contingencies.\nEnvironmental Laws and Regulations\nThe activities of OG&E are subject to numerous stringent and complex Federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection. These laws and regulations can change, restrict or otherwise impact OG&E's business activities in many ways including the handling or disposal of waste material, future construction activities to avoid or mitigate harm to threatened or endangered species and requiring the installation and operation of emissions pollution control equipment. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. OG&E believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with current Federal, state and local environmental standards.\nEnvironmental regulation can increase the cost of planning, design, initial installation and operation of OG&E's facilities. Historically, OG&E's total expenditures for environmental control facilities and for remediation have not been significant in relation to its financial position or results of operations. OG&E believes, however, that it is likely that the trend in environmental legislation and regulations will continue towards more restrictive standards. Compliance with these standards is expected to increase the cost of conducting business. Management continues to evaluate its compliance with existing and proposed environmental legislation and regulations and implement appropriate environmental programs in a competitive market.\nOG&E expects that environmental expenditures necessary to comply with the environmental laws and regulations discussed below will qualify as part of a pre-approval plan to handle state and Federally mandated environmental upgrades which will be recoverable in Oklahoma from OG&E's retail customers under House Bill 1910, which was enacted into law in May 2005.\nIt is estimated that OG&E's total expenditures to comply with environmental laws, regulations and requirements for 2016 will be $195.9 million, of which $178.3 million is for capital expenditures. It is estimated that OG&E's total expenditures to comply with environmental laws, regulations and requirements for 2017 will be approximately $166.7 million, of which $148.7 million is for capital expenditures. The amounts above include capital expenditures for low NOX burners and dry scrubbers.\nAir\nFederal Clean Air Act Overview\nOG&E's operations are subject to the Federal Clean Air Act as amended, and comparable state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including electric generating units, and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. Such laws and regulations may require that OG&E obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions or result in the increase of existing air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations or install emission control equipment. OG&E likely will be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment and technology in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions.\nRegional Haze Control Measures\nThe EPA's 2005 regional haze rule is intended to protect visibility in certain national parks and wilderness areas throughout the United States that may be impacted by air pollutant emissions.\nOn February 18,"}
