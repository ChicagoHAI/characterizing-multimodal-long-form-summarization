Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nThis Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 is filed by Advanced Emissions Solutions, Inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, \"ADES,\" the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" or \"our\" unless the context indicates otherwise).\nWe are a leader in emissions reductions technologies through consumables that utilize powdered activated carbon ( PAC\u201d) and chemical based technologies, primarily serving the coal-fired power generation and industrial boiler industries. Our proprietary environmental technologies and specialty chemicals enable our customers to reduce emissions of mercury and other pollutants, maximize utilization levels and improve operating efficiencies to meet the challenges of existing and potential emissions control regulations. See further discussion of our business included in Item 1 - \"Business\" (\"Item 1\") of this Report. Discussion regarding segment information is included within the discussion of our consolidated results under this Item 7. Additionally, discussion related to our reportable segments is included in Item 1 and Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nOn December 7, 2018 (the Acquisition Date\u201d), we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests (the \"Carbon Solutions Acquisition\u201d) of ADA Carbon Solutions, LLC ( CS\u201d or Carbon Solutions\u201d). Carbon Solutions is an activated carbon company and the North American leader in mercury capture using powdered activated carbon for the coal-fired power plant, industrial and water treatment markets. Carbon Solutions owns and operates an activated carbon ( AC\u201d) manufacturing and processing facility. It also owns an associated lignite mine that supplies the raw material for the powdered activated carbon plant ( Five Forks Mine\u201d). Our operating results for 2018 include the operating results of Carbon Solutions for the period from December 7, 2018 to December 31, 2018.\nOn December 7, 2018, ADES and ADA-ES, Inc. (\"ADA\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary, and certain other subsidiaries of the Company as guarantors, The Bank of New York Mellon as administrative agent, and Apollo Credit Strategies Master Fund Ltd. and Apollo A-N Credit Fund (Delaware) L.P. (collectively \"Apollo\u201d), affiliates of a beneficial owner of greater than five percent of the Company's common stock and related parties, entered into the Term Loan and Security Agreement (the \"Senior Term Loan\") in the principal amount of $70.0 million, less original issue discount of $2.1 million. Proceeds from the Senior Term Loan were used to fund the Carbon Solutions Acquisition.\nComponents of Revenue, Expenses and Equity Method Investees\nThe following briefly describes the components of revenues and expenses as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Descriptions of the revenue recognition policies are included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nRevenues and costs of revenue\nConsumables\nWe sell PAC and proprietary chemical blends to coal-fired utilities and other industrial boilers that allow the respective utilities to comply with the regulatory emissions standards. Additionally, we also sell PAC to water treatment plants to remove contaminants from the water. Revenue is generally recorded upon delivery of our product.\nCertain customer contracts are comprised of evaluation tests (\"Evaluation Tests\") of the Company's chemicals' effectiveness and efficiency in reducing emissions and entail the delivery of products to the customer and the Company evaluating results of emissions reduction over the term of the contract. The Company generally recognizes revenue from Evaluation Tests over the duration of the contract based on the cost of product consumed by the customer.\nLicense royalties, related party\nWe license our M-45TM and M-45-PCTM emission control technologies (\"M-45 License\") to Tinuum Group and realize royalty income based upon a percentage of the per-ton, pre-tax margin as defined in the M-45 License.\nEquipment sales\nEquipment sales represent the sale of activated carbon injection (\"ACI\") systems to control mercury, dry sorbent injection (\"DSI\") systems to control sulfur dioxide (SO2), sulfur trioxide (SO3), and hydrogen chloride (HCl) and electrostatic precipitator (\"ESP\") liquid flue gas conditioning systems. Revenue from extended equipment contracts was recorded using the completed contract method of accounting.\nWe also may enter into other non-extended equipment contracts for which we generally recognize revenues on a time and material basis as services to build equipment systems are performed or as equipment is delivered.\nOther Operating Expenses\nPayroll and benefits\nPayroll and benefits costs include personnel related fringe benefits, sales and administrative staff labor costs and stock compensation expenses. Payroll and benefits costs exclude direct labor included in Cost of revenue.\nRent and occupancy\nRent and occupancy costs include rent, insurance, and other occupancy-related expenses.\nLegal and professional fees\nLegal and professional costs include external legal, audit and consulting expenses.\nGeneral and administrative\nGeneral and administrative costs include director fees and expenses, bad debt expense, research and development expense and other general costs of conducting business. Research and development costs, net of reimbursements from cost-sharing arrangements, are charged to expense in the period incurred and are reported in the General and administrative line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nDepreciation, amortization, depletion, and accretion\nDepreciation and amortization expense consists of depreciation expense related to property, plant and equipment and the amortization of long-lived intangibles. Depletion and accretion expense consists of depletion expense related to the depletion of mine development costs and the accretion of a mine reclamation liability.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nEarnings from equity method investments\nEarnings from equity method investments relates to our share of earnings (losses) related to our equity method investments.\nOur equity method earnings in Tinuum Group, LLC (\"Tinuum Group\"), a related party in which we own a 42.5% equity interest and a 50% voting interest, are positively impacted when Tinuum Group obtains an investor in a refined coal (\"RC\") facility and receives lease payments from the lessee, or purchase payments from the sale, of the RC facility. If Tinuum Group operates a retained RC facility, the Company's equity method earnings will be negatively impacted as operating retained RC facilities generate operating losses. However, we benefit on an after-tax basis if we are able to utilize tax credits associated with the production and sale of RC from operation of retained RC facilities by Tinuum Group. These benefits, if utilized, will increase our consolidated net income as a result of a reduction in income tax expense.\nTinuum Services, LLC (\"Tinuum Services\"), a related party in which we own both a 50% equity and voting interest, operates and maintains RC facilities under operating and maintenance agreements. Tinuum Group or the lessee/owner of the RC facilities pays Tinuum Services, subject to certain limitations, the costs of operating and maintaining the RC facilities plus certain fees. Tinuum Services also arranges for the purchase and delivery of certain chemical additives under chemical agency agreements necessary for the production of RC. Tinuum Services consolidates certain RC facilities leased or owned by tax equity investors that are deemed to be variable interest entities (\"VIE's). All net income (loss) associated with these VIE's is allocated to the noncontrolling equity holders of Tinuum Services and therefore does not impact our equity earnings (loss) from Tinuum Services.\nOther income (expense)\nThe remaining components of other income (expense) include interest income, interest expense and other miscellaneous items. For 2017, miscellaneous items included an adjustment to a litigation loss accrual and changes in estimate related to royalty indemnity expense.\nWe record interest expense related to our Senior Term Loan and capital leases, as well as through our share of Tinuum Group's equity method earnings for RC facility leases or sales that are treated as installment sales for tax purposes. IRC Section 453A (\"Section 453A\") requires taxpayers using the installment method to pay an interest charge on the portion of the tax liability that is deferred under the installment method. We refer to this as \"453A interest.\"\nResults of Operations\nFor comparison purposes, the following tables set forth our results of operations for the years presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. The results for the year ended December 31, 2018 include the results of operations of Carbon Solutions from the Acquisition Date through December 31. The year-to-year comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of financial results that may be achieved in future years.\nYear ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year ended December 31, 2017\nTotal Revenue and Cost of Revenue\nA summary of the components of revenues and cost of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumables\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>License royalties, related party\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equipment sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31,374\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(21,419\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(47\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumables cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equipment cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(353\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(28,804\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(101\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsumables and consumables cost of revenue\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, consumables revenue increased year over year primarily due to the Carbon Solutions Acquisition on December 7, 2018. Carbon Solutions contributed consumables revenue of $5.6 million of the total consumables revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. Excluding Carbon Solutions' consumables revenues, consumables revenues decreased year over year primarily due to a significant decrease in sales to two customers, partially offset by increased sales to new customers in 2018. The total pounds of our chemicals sold decreased year over year and gross margins decreased year over year primarily due to ongoing price compression. During the year ended December 31, 2018, revenues from Evaluation Tests increased year over year primarily from two significant customer contracts that were completed in 2018. Cost of consumables revenue for Carbon Solutions for 2018 was $3.4 million and excluding this amount cost of consumables revenue increased year over year. This increase was primarily due to significant costs incurred that exceeded revenues by $0.5 million on one of the Evaluation Test contracts, which was the primary negative impact on our overall consumables gross margin for 2018.\nConsumables cost of revenue will be negatively impacted in 2019 due to the amortization of a step-up in inventory fair value of approximately $5.0 million related to the Carbon Solutions Acquisition.\nLicense royalties, related party\nRoyalty income increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to Tinuum Group obtaining tax equity investors for two incremental RC facilities during 2018 and to the full year of operations in 2018 of the four incremental RC facilities sold or leased to tax equity investors in 2017, all of which use our M-45 License. The total facilities that use our M-45 License increased from 10 facilities in 2017 to 12 facilities in 2018. The increase in facilities resulted in an increase in rental and sales payments to Tinuum Group and an increase in the related tons produced and sold subject to the M-45 License. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were 37.3 million tons and 22.6 million tons, respectively, of RC produced using the M-45 License.\nEquipment sales and Equipment sales cost of revenue\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we did not enter into any long-term (6 months or longer) fixed price contracts to supply ACI systems. As of December 31, 2017, all ACI system contracts were completed. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed four ACI systems, recognizing revenues of $3.4 million and cost of revenue of $2.4 million.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we did not enter into any long term (6 months or longer) fixed price contracts to supply DSI systems. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed five DSI systems, recognizing revenues of $27.8 million and cost of revenue of $26.0 million. As of January 1, 2018, all revenues and costs of revenues were recognized on the three DSI system uncompleted contracts as of December 31, 2017 upon the adoption of the new revenue accounting standard, ASC 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\nThe remaining changes were due to other equipment sales.\nDemand for ACI and DSI system contracts historically was driven by coal-fired power plant utilities that need to comply with Federal Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (\"MATS\") and Maximum Achievable Control Technology Standards (\"MACT\"). As\nthe deadline for these standards has passed, we do not expect to enter into any future long-term fixed price contracts for ACI and DSI systems.\nAdditional information related to revenue concentrations and contributions by class and reportable segment can be found within the segment discussion below and in Note 6 and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nOther Operating Expenses\nA summary of the components of our operating expenses, exclusive of cost of revenue items (presented above), for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payroll and benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rent and occupancy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legal and professional fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(655\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation, amortization, depletion, and accretion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(66\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPayroll and benefits\nPayroll and benefits expenses increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to restructuring expenses in connection with the departure of certain executive officers and management's alignment of the business with strategic objectives during 2018, as well as the elimination of certain duplicative positions in connection with the Carbon Solutions Acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded net restructuring charges of $3.1 million. As of December 31, 2018, $2.2 million of this expense remained accrued. Payment of accrued amounts is expected to occur during 2019 from cash on hand. There were no material restructuring expenses recorded in 2017. Additionally, payroll-related expenses increased due to the increase in headcount of personnel from the Carbon Solutions Acquisition, which resulted in an increase in average headcount of 10% for 2018 compared to 2017. We expect an increase in future recurring payroll-related expense due to the Carbon Solutions Acquisition.\nRent and occupancy\nRent and occupancy expenses increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to lower rent and occupancy expense in 2017 as a result of the relocation of our corporate headquarters in the first quarter of 2017 and the acceleration of deferred rent and tenant improvement allowances recorded in 2017 associated with the termination of the lease agreement of our former corporate headquarters.\nLegal and professional fees\nLegal and professional fees expenses increased in 2018 compared to 2017 as a result of costs incurred related to the Carbon Solutions Acquisition of approximately $4.5 million as well as an increase in consulting fees related to ongoing clarification of federal income tax reform of $0.5 million. These costs were partially offset by a decrease in costs related to outsourced shared service costs, including legal and audit fees.\nGeneral and administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to a $0.4 million reserve on an asset related to a letter of credit drawn by a former customer that was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017. Additional decreases included a reduction in general operating expenses of approximately $0.4 million, which included decreases in outsourced IT costs and outside director expenses. Offsetting these decreases was an increase in bad debt expense incurred of $0.2 million.\nDepreciation, amortization, depletion, and accretion\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to higher depreciation recorded in 2017 related to the acceleration of depreciation on certain fixed assets that were disposed of in connection with our corporate office relocation, which was completed in the first quarter of 2017. This decrease is offset by the addition of long-lived assets\nacquired as part of the Carbon Solutions Acquisition, which contributed approximately $0.4 million of depreciation expense for the period between Acquisition Date and December 31, 2018.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nA summary of the components of our other income (expense), net for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows: Table 90: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from equity method investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>343\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,151\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,024\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Litigation settlement and royalty indemnity expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,269\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,044\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(101\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,890\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEarnings in equity method investments\nThe following table presents the equity method earnings, by investee, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017: Table 91: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from Tinuum Group\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,700\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from Tinuum Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from equity method investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEarnings from equity method investments, and changes related thereto, are impacted by our most significant equity method investees: Tinuum Group and Tinuum Services. Earnings from equity method investments increased during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 primarily as a result of the addition of two invested facilities during 2018. However, cash distributions to us from Tinuum Group, and related equity earnings, during 2018 were negatively impacted as a result of $17.6 million of capital expenditures incurred by Tinuum Group related to the engineering and installation of RC facilities. See the discussion below regarding the accounting of earnings from Tinuum Group.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $47.2 million in equity earnings from Tinuum Group compared to our proportionate share of Tinuum Group's net income of $57.7 million for the year. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized $48.9 million in equity earnings from Tinuum Group compared to our proportionate share of Tinuum Group's net income of $46.6 million for the year. The difference between our pro-rata share of Tinuum Group's net income and our earnings from our Tinuum Group equity method investment as reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations relates to us receiving cumulative distributions in excess of the carrying value of the investment, and therefore recognizing such excess distributions as equity method earnings in the period the distributions occur, as discussed in more detail below.\nAs a result of cash flows from invested RC facilities, Tinuum Group distributions to us during the year ended December 31, 2018 were $47.2 million, which resulted in us continuing to have cumulative cash distributions that exceeded our cumulative pro-rata share of Tinuum Group's net income as of December 31, 2018.\nThe following table

from mathematical calculations of the Company's 42.5% equity interest in Tinuum Group multiplied by the amounts of Net Income available to Class A members as shown in the table above of Tinuum Group results of operations due to adjustments related to the Class B preferred return.\nTinuum Group plans to adopt Accounting Standard Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09 (Topic 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09\u201d) and ASU 2016-02 (Topic 842), Leases ( ASU 2016-02\u201d) as of January 1, 2019. As a result of Tinuum Group's adoption, we expect to record a cumulative adjustment of $37.2 million related to our portion of Tinuum Group's cumulative effect adjustment that will increase our Retained Earnings as of January 1, 2019. We expect that this adjustment will result in us no longer having cumulative cash distributions that exceed our cumulative pro-rata share of Tinuum Group's net income. Additionally, we expect that we will recognize equity earnings by recording our pro-rata share of Tinuum Group's net income rather than based upon cash distributions on a go-forward basis. Upon adoption, we will assess the impact of the adjustment to our income tax position.\nTinuum Group's consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are included in Item 15 of this Report.\nEquity earnings from our interest in Tinuum Services increased by $2.1 million in 2018 compared to 2017. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, Tinuum Services provided operating and maintenance services to 18 and 16 RC facilities, respectively. Tinuum Services derives earnings from both fixed-fee arrangements as well as fees that are tied to actual RC production, depending upon the specific RC facility operating and maintenance agreement.\nAdditional information related to equity method investments can be found in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nTax Credits\nWe earned the following tax credits that may be available for future benefit related to the production of RC from the operation of retained RC facilities under the Internal Revenue Code (\"IRC\") Section 45 - Production Tax Credit (\"Section 45 tax credits\"): Table 93: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Section 45 tax credits earned\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in the Section 45 tax credits earned during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 was due to our direct ownership and Tinuum Group's ownership in an RC facility that generated tax credits for the entirety of 2018 compared to a six-month period in 2017.\nAs discussed in Item 1 of this Report, Tinuum Group operates and leases or sells facilities used in the production and sale of RC to third party tax equity investors. All dispositions of such facilities are treated as installment sales for federal income tax purposes at Tinuum Group. The resulting gain from these sales is reported by Tinuum Group pursuant to the installment method under IRC Section 453. Under Section 453A taxpayers using the installment method for income tax purposes are required to pay 453A interest that is calculated on the portion of the tax liability that is deferred under the installment method. As of December 31, 2018, ADES's allocable share of the gross deferred installment sale gain from Tinuum Group to be recognized in future years was approximately $170 million.\nDue to the production and sale of RC from the operation of retained RC facilities, Tinuum Group has generated Section 45 tax credits (\"GBC's\"). These GBC's are allocated to the owners of Tinuum Group, including us, who may benefit to the extent that the GBC's are realized from the operation of retained RC facilities. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $104.6 million in GBC carryforwards.\nIn the hypothetical event of an ownership change, as defined by IRC Section 382, utilization of the GBC's generated prior to the change would be subject to an annual limitation imposed by IRC Section 383 for GBC's. The results of a recent analysis indicated that we had not experienced an ownership change as of December 31, 2018, as defined by IRC Section 382. Such analysis for the period from January 1, 2019 through the date of this Report has not been completed. Therefore, it is possible that we experienced an ownership change between January 1, 2019 and the date of this filing, thus subjecting our GBC carryforwards to limitation. Should a limitation exist, however, we would likely be in a position to substantially increase the limitation amount by virtue of our approximately $170 million deferred installment sale gain at Tinuum Group.\nSpecifically, IRC Section 382 provides that a corporation with a net unrealized built-in gain (\"NUBIG\") immediately before an ownership change may increase its limitation by the amount of recognized built-in gain (\"RBIG\") arising from the sale of a built-in gain asset during a recognition period, which is generally the five-year period immediately following an ownership change. Built-in gain reported on the installment sale method that is attributable to assets sold by the corporation before or during the recognition period may increase the corporation's limitation during and after the recognition period. Therefore, it is likely that any IRC Section 382 limitation imposed upon an ownership change may be increased by our share of RBIG from Tinuum Group's installment sale gain attributable to RC facilities sold before or during the period in which the change in ownership occurred.\nThere are numerous assumptions, listed below, that must be considered in calculating the RBIG related to Tinuum Group and the increase to our IRC Section 383 limitation. Assuming these assumptions, we may be able to increase the total limitation by approximately $170 million over the duration of the installment sale. As of December 31, 2018, after increasing the total hypothetical limitation, we would likely not have been able to utilize approximately $43.0 million of tax credits.\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The Tinuum Group RBIG is a result of the sale of RC facilities by Tinuum Group and its election to utilize the installment sale method for tax purposes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Investors in RC facilities will not terminate existing contracts as completion of an installment sale transaction is necessary to realize RBIG;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We have no net unrealized built-in loss to offset the NUBIG from Tinuum Group;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our RBIG is equal to the deferred gain allocated from Tinuum Group, which is approximately $170 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We will have a NUBIG immediately before a hypothetical ownership change such that the Tinuum Group RBIG is available to increase the IRC Section 382 limitation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We will continue our historic business operations for at least two years following a hypothetical ownership change; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A second ownership change does not occur.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The annual limitation will be increased by the amount of RBIG that is included in taxable income each year.\nInterest expense\n453A interest expense decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 by $1.0 million. This reduction was driven by a lower tax rate of 21% in 2018 compared to 35% in 2017 as well as fewer principal payments remaining, partially offset by an increase in invested RC facilities in which Tinuum Group recognized as installment sales for tax purposes from 17 as of December 31, 2017 to 19 as of December 31, 2018.\nThe following table shows the balance of the tax liability that has been deferred and the applicable interest rate to calculate 453A interest:\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax liability deferred on installment sales (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Represents the approximate tax effected liability utilizing the federal tax rate in effect for the applicable years ended related to the deferred gain on installment sales (approximately $170 million as of December 31, 2018).\nBased on the interest rate in effect as of the date of this filing, the 453A interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 is expected to be 6%.\nOffsetting the decrease in 453A interest expense was an increase due to $0.5 million in interest related to the Senior Term Loan entered into on December 7, 2018 to fund the Carbon Solutions Acquisition.\nOther\nThe components of Other income (expense) include the following significant items:\nIndemnity Settlement Agreement\nIn December 2017, prior to the Carbon Solutions Acquisition, we, Carbon Solutions and the former parent company of Carbon Solutions agreed to terminate certain provisions of the Indemnity Settlement Agreement (the \" Indemnity Termination Agreement\"). Pursuant to an agreement executed concurrently with the Indemnity Termination Agreement, the Company, Norit International B.V. and one of its an affiliates (collectively referred to as Norit\u201d) agreed to a final payment in the amount of $3.3 million (the \"Settlement Payment\") to settle all outstanding royalty obligations (the \"Royalty Award\") owed under the terms of a settlement agreement executed in 2011 between the Company and Norit. We paid this amount on December 29, 2017.\nUnder the Indemnity Termination Agreement, and upon payment of the Settlement Payment, we were relieved of certain financial and indemnity obligations required by the terms of the settlement agreement with Norit, including the obligation to maintain LC's securing future royalty payment obligations. As of December 31, 2017, $3.5 million in LC's related to the Royalty Award were outstanding, but were canceled by all parties in January 2018, pursuant to the Indemnity Termination Agreement.\nSettlement with service provider\nIn November 2017, we entered into a settlement agreement with a former third-party service provider and as part of the settlement we received cash in the amount of $3.5 million. Cash from this settlement was received in December 2017.\nAdvanced Emission Solutions, Inc. Profit Sharing Retirement Plan\nIn 2016, the DOL opened an investigation into the Advanced Emissions Solutions, Inc. Profit Sharing Retirement Plan (the 401(k) Plan\u201d), and we, as Plan Sponsor, cooperated with that investigation. In February 2018, as part of ongoing discussions, we and the DOL came to an agreement whereby we would make a restorative payment to the 401(k) Plan in the amount of $1.0 million as an estimate of lost earnings for 401(k) Plan participants as of January 1, 2015. Thereafter, the DOL would close the investigation with no further action against the 401(k) Plan or its fiduciaries, including any further investigation. We determined this contingency to be both probable and reasonably estimable and accrued $1.0 million as of December 31, 2017. The liability was recorded in the Other current liabilities line item on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The expense recognized related to this accrual was included in the Other line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. We made a payment of $1.0 million to the 401(k) Plan on June 1, 2018 and no liability existed as of December 31, 2018. On September 7, 2018, we received notification that the DOL had closed its investigation and no further action is required by us.\nImpairment of cost method investment\nIn November 2014, we acquired an 8% ownership interest in the common stock of Highview (\"Highview\"), a London, England based development stage company specializing in power storage. We accounted for our investment in Highview (the \"Highview Investment\") in accordance with U.S. GAAP applicable to equity investments that do not qualify for the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 2017, we recorded an impairment charge of $0.5 million for the Highview Investment based on an estimated fair value of \u00a31.00 per share compared to the estimated carrying value prior to the impairment charge of \u00a32.00 per share. The impairment charge was included in the Other line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nIncome tax expense\nOn December 22, 2017 (the \"Enactment Date\"), the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"). The Tax Act made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code and key provisions applicable to the Company, or certain of Tinuum Group's existing or potential customers, for 2018 included the following: (1) reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent; (2) elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT); (3) a new limitation on deductible interest expense; (4) limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation; (5) limitations on the use of federal tax credits (\"FTCs\") to reduce the U.S. income tax liability; (6) limitations on net operating losses (\"NOL's\") generated after December 31, 2017, to 80 percent of taxable income; and the introduction of the Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax ( BEAT\u201d) for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017.\nAs a result of the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, we recorded an adjustment to our recorded deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of the Enactment Date for those temporary differences expected to reverse after the Enactment Date. During 2018, we did not make any accounting adjustments related to the Tax Act.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, our reported income tax expense of $10.4 million differed from income tax expense computed by applying the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate (the \"Federal Rate\") of $9.6 million primarily due to a reduction in income tax expense from tax credits realized of $7.0 million, offset by increases in income tax expense from state income tax expense, net of federal benefit of $3.6 million and an increase in the valuation adjustment on our deferred tax assets of $4.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our reported income tax expense of $24.2 million differed from income tax expense computed using the Federal Rate of $18.2 million primarily due to increases in income tax expense from state income tax expense, net of federal benefit of $1.7 million and from a reduction in our net deferred tax assets of $5.8 million from the change in federal tax rates from 35% to 21%, offset by a decrease in income tax expense from tax credits realized of $1.9 million.\nAccounting for income taxes requires that companies assess whether a valuation allowance should be recorded against their deferred tax asset based on an assessment of the amount of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not\u201d to be realized. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nWe assess the valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets at each reporting date. The determination of whether a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is appropriate requires the evaluation of positive and negative evidence that can be objectively verified. Consideration must be given to all sources of taxable income available to realize the deferred tax asset, including, as applicable, the future reversal of existing temporary differences, future taxable income forecasts exclusive of the reversal of temporary differences and carryforwards, taxable income in carryback years and tax planning strategies. In estimating taxes, we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions taking into account statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we concluded it is more likely than not we will generate sufficient taxable income within the applicable NOL and tax credit carry-forward periods to realize $32.5 million of our net deferred tax assets, and therefore, reversed $4.5 million of the valuation allowance. In reaching this conclusion, we most significantly considered: (1) forecasts of continued future taxable income and (2) impacts of additional RC invested facilities during 2018. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had a valuation allowance recorded of $79.9 million and $75.4 million, respectively, against our deferred tax assets.\nDuring 2019, due to the impact of Tinuum Group selling an additional RC facility during the three months ended March 31, 2019, as well as the impacts of Tinuum Group's adoption of ASU 2014-09 and ASU 2016-02, we expect that we will record an adjustment to our valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets.\nThe ability to recognize the remaining deferred tax assets that continue to be subject to a valuation allowance is evaluated on a quarterly basis to determine if there are any significant events that would affect the ability to utilize those deferred tax assets.\nOur estimate of future taxable income is based on internal projections that consider historical performance, multiple internal scenarios and assumptions, as well as external data that we believe is reasonable. If events are identified that affect our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, or if additional deferred tax assets are generated, the analysis will be updated to determine if any\nadjustments to the valuation allowance are required. If actual results differ negatively from the current estimates of future taxable income, even if caused by adverse macro-economic conditions, the remaining valuation allowance may need to be increased. Such an increase could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Conversely, better than expected results and continued positive results and trends could result in further releases to the deferred tax valuation allowance, and any such decreases could have a material positive effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSee additional discussion in Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nBusiness Segments\nAs of December 31, 2018, we have two reportable segments: (1) Refined Coal (\"RC'); and (2) Power Generation and Industrials (\"PGI\") (f/k/a \"Emissions Control\").\nThe business segment measurements provided to and evaluated by our chief operating decision maker are computed in accordance with the principles listed below:\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies except as described below.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Segment revenues include equity method earnings and losses from our equity method investments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Segment operating income (loss) includes segment revenues, gains related to sales of equity method investments and allocation of certain \"Corporate general and administrative expenses,\" which include Payroll and benefits, Rent and occupancy, Legal and professional fees, and General and administrative.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>RC segment operating income includes interest expense directly attributable to the RC segment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The principal products and services of our segments are:\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1.\n</td> <td>RC - Our RC segment derives its earnings from equity method investments as well as royalty payment streams and other revenues related to enhanced combustion of and reduced emissions of both NOX and mercury from the burning of RC.

Segment revenues include equity method earnings (losses) from our equity method investments and royalty earnings from Tinuum Group. These earnings are included within the Earnings from equity method investments and License royalties, related party line items in the Consolidated Statements of Operations included in Item 8 of this Report. Key drivers to RC segment performance are the produced and sold RC from both operating and retained RC facilities, royalty-bearing tonnage, and the number of operating (leased or sold) and retained RC facilities.

Our equity earnings increased primarily due to an increase in Tinuum Services' earnings as a result of the addition of two invested facilities. Cash distributions decreased year over year as a result of incurred costs related to the engineering and installation phases of RC facilities, which have reduced distributions to Tinuum Group's equity members even though Tinuum Group did obtain two additional invested facilities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Tinuum Group's consolidated earnings increased $26.0 million from the comparable December 31, 2017 period due to an increase in lease revenues driven by increased sales of facilities to third-party investors.\nAs discussed above and in Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report, our earnings in Tinuum Group may not equal our pro-rata share due to the accounting related to our equity method investment.\nRC operating income in 2018 was also positively impacted for the following:\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>An increase in earnings from Tinuum Services, which was primarily due to an increase in the number of RC facilities operated by Tinuum Services during 2018;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>An increase in M-45 royalties earned as a result of increased tonnage; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A decrease in 453A interest expense as a result of the decreased federal tax rate and the declining deferred tax liability.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> PGI\nPGI segment operating income decreased during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to a decrease in revenues year over year, as discussed within the consolidated results. The decrease in PGI segment operating income was driven by a decrease in Equipment sales revenue, less equipment sales cost of revenue, as no further revenue from equipment sales is expected. Additionally, PGI operating income was positively impacted by incremental Carbon Solutions revenues of $5.6 million, offset by cost of revenues of $3.4 million, inclusive of $1.0 million related to the amortization of a step up in basis of acquired finished goods inventory related to Carbon Solutions Acquisition. The decrease in operating income is also due to an increase in restructuring expense of $0.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview of Factors Affecting Our Liquidity\nDuring 2018, our liquidity position was positively affected primarily from distributions from Tinuum Group and Tinuum Services, royalty payments from Tinuum Group and borrowing availability under our bank (\"Lender\") line of credit (the \"Line of Credit\").\nOur principal sources of liquidity currently include:\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>cash and cash equivalents on hand;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>distributions from Tinuum Group and Tinuum Services;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>royalty payments from Tinuum Group;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the Line of Credit; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>operations in the PGI segment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Our principal uses of liquidity during the year ended December 31, 2018 included:\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>acquisition of Carbon Solutions\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>payment of dividends;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>repurchases of shares of our common stock pursuant to a stock repurchase program by which we may repurchase up to $20.0 million of our outstanding common stock, from time to time;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our business operating expenses, including federal and state tax payments; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>delivering on our existing contracts and customer commitments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Our ability to continue to generate sufficient cash flow required to meet ongoing operational needs and obligations, as well as future expected dividend payments and potential future share repurchases, depends upon several factors, including executing on our contracts and initiatives, receiving royalty payments from Tinuum Group and distributions from Tinuum Group and Tinuum Services, and increasing our share of the market for PGI consumables as well as expansion of our overall PAC business into additional adjacent markets. Increased distributions from Tinuum Group will likely be dependent upon both preserving existing contractual relationships and the securing of additional tax equity investors for those Tinuum Group facilities that are currently not operating.\nOur use of liquidity for capital expenditures has not been significant for the periods presented. Due to the acquisition of Carbon Solutions, we expect that use of liquidity for capital expenditures will increase in future periods. Carbon Solutions has historically incurred costs for capital expenditures related to the PAC manufacturing facility under normal operations and planned outages and for mine development at the Five Forks. Certain of Carbon Solutions' recent historical planned capital expenditures were delayed due to the sales process. During due diligence and validated upon acquisition, we evaluated capital expenditure needs and anticipate additional material capital resources will be needed to maintain or improve capital assets.\nTinuum Group and Tinuum Services Distributions\nThe following table summarizes the cash distributions from our equity method investments, which most significantly affected our consolidated cash flow results, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tinuum Group\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tinuum Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributions from equity method investees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFuture cash flows from Tinuum through 2021 are expected to range from $200 to $225 million, and key drivers in achieving these future cash flows are based on the following:\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>19 invested facilities as of December 31, 2018 and inclusive of all net Tinuum cash flows (distributions and license royalties), offset by estimated federal and state income tax payments and 453A interest payments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Expected future cash flows from Tinuum Group are based on the following key assumptions:\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Tinuum Group continues to not operate retained facilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Tinuum Group does not have material capital expenditures or unusual operating expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Tax equity lease renewals on invested facilities are not terminated or repriced; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Coal-fired power generation remains constant.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Future incremental invested RC facilities would positively impact our expectation of future cash flows.\nSenior Term Loan\nOn December 7, 2018, we executed the Senior Term Loan with Apollo in the principal amount of $70.0 million, less original issue discount of $2.1 million. We also paid debt issuance costs of $2.0 million related to the Senior Term Loan. The Senior Term Loan has a term of 36 months and bears interest at a rate equal to 3-month LIBOR (subject to a 1.5% floor) + 4.75% per annum, which is adjusted quarterly to the current 3-month LIBOR rate, and interest is payable quarterly in arrears. Quarterly principal payments of $6.0 million are required beginning in March 2019, and we may prepay the Senior Term Loan at any time without penalty. The Senior Term Loan is secured by substantially all of our assets, including the cash flows from Tinuum Group and Tinuum Services, but excluding our equity interests in those Tinuum entities.\nThe Senior Term Loan includes, among others, the following covenants: (1) Beginning December 31, 2018 and as of the end of each fiscal quarter thereafter, we must maintain a minimum cash balance of $5.0 million and shall not permit \"expected future net cash flows from the refined coal business\" (as defined in the Senior Term Loan) to be less than 1.75 times the outstanding principal amount of the Senior Term Loan; (2) Beginning in January 2019, annual collective dividends and buybacks of shares of our common stock in an aggregate amount, not to exceed $30.0 million, are permitted so long as (a) no default or event of default exists under the Senior Term Loan and (b) expected future net cash flows from the refined coal business as of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter exceed $100.0 million.\nStock Repurchases and Dividends\nIn November 2018, the Board authorized us to purchase up to $20.0 million of our outstanding common stock. This stock repurchase program will remain in effect until December 31, 2019 unless otherwise modified by the Board. Previously, in December 2017, the Board had authorized us to purchase up to $20.0 million of our outstanding common stock under a separate repurchase program that was in effect until July 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2018, under these two stock repurchase programs, we purchased 2,350,422 shares of our common stock for cash of $25.3 million, inclusive of commissions and fees.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we declared and paid quarterly cash dividends to stockholders of $20.2 million, which were paid on March 8, 2018, June 8, 2018, September 6, 2018 and December 6, 2018.\nLine of Credit\nAs of December 31, 2018, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Line of Credit.\nOn September 30, 2018, ADA, as borrower, ADES, as guarantor, and the Lender entered into an amendment (the \"Twelfth Amendment\") to the Line of Credit. The Twelfth Amendment decreased the Line of Credit to $5.0 million due to decreased collateral requirements, extended the maturity date of the Line of Credit to September 30, 2020 and permitted the Line of Credit to be used as collateral (in place of restricted cash) for letters of credit (\"LC's\") up to $5.0 million related to equipment projects and certain other agreements. Under the Twelfth Amendment, there was no minimum cash balance requirement based on us meeting certain conditions and maintaining minimum trailing twelve-month EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), as previously defined in the \"Eleventh Amendment\" to the Line of Credit, of $24.0 million.\nOn December 7, 2018, ADA, as borrower, ADES as guarantor, and the Lender entered into an amendment to the Line of Credit, which provided, among other things, for ADA to be able to enter into the Senior Term Loan as a guarantor so long as the principal amount of the Senior Term Loan does not exceed $70 million. Additionally, the financial covenants in the Line of Credit were amended and restated to be consistent with the aforementioned Senior Term Loan covenants, including maintaining a minimum cash balance of $5.0 million.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased from $30.7 million as of December 31, 2017 to $23.8 million as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $6.9 million. The following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively: Table 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,889\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11,748\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,543\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(64,929\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32,889\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,921\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,670\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash flows from operating activities\nCash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $1.9 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 and were positively impacted primarily by the following: (1) an increase in net income of $7.6 million; (2) a change in Legal settlements and accruals due to settlement of obligation results in cash outflow of $16.1 million in 2017; and (3) an increase in Distributions from equity method investees, return on investment of $0.9 million. Offsetting these increases to operating cash flows were primarily the following: (1) a decrease of $17.5 million due to the change in deferred tax assets as a result of utilization to offset taxable income in 2017 and changes to the valuation allowance in 2018; and (2) a net increase in working capital and other liabilities of $4.6 million, primarily due to an increase in receivables from Tinuum Group related to revenues from license royalties and an increase in receivables from customers as a result of the addition of new customers from the Carbons Solutions Acquisition.\nCash flows from investing activities\nDistributions from equity method investees\nOur cash flows from investing activities are significantly impacted by cash distributions from equity method investees that represent a return in excess of cumulative earnings, which decreased from $48.9 million in 2017 to $47.2 million in 2018. All of these cash distributions were received from Tinuum Group.\nAcquisition of business, net of cash acquired\nThe Carbon Solutions Acquisition completed in 2018 resulted in total cash consideration paid of $65.8 million less cash acquired of $3.3 million. In addition, the total purchase consideration included $0.7 million payable to Carbon Solutions' previous debt holder, which was paid in March 2019. Also as part of the Carbon Solutions Acquisition, we also assumed capital leases and other contractual commitments of $11.8 million.\nPurchase of and contribution to equity method investee\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018 we made a contribution to Tinuum Services of $0.8 million due to a capital call.\nCash flows from financing activities\nBorrowings on long-term debt, related party and debt issuance costs paid\nWe funded the Carbon Solutions Acquisition through cash on hand and the proceeds of the Senior Term Loan in the principal amount of $70.0 million, net of original issue discount of $2.1 million. In addition, we paid debt issuance costs of $2.0 million.\nDividends Paid and Stock Repurchases\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we made payments of $20.2 million and $15.7 million, respectively, related to dividends declared on our common stock.\nStock Repurchases\nAs described under this Item 7 and in Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, under stock repurchase programs authorized by the Board, we purchased 2,350,422 shares and 1,713,766 shares of our common stock for cash of $25.3 million and $16.4 million, respectively, inclusive of commissions and fees. The total shares of common stock repurchased for the year ended December 31, 2017 is inclusive of a dutch tender offer completed in June 2017 in which we acquired 1,370,891 shares of common stock for $13.0 million.\nEquity Award Activity\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we used cash of $0.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively, for the repurchase of shares to satisfy tax withholdings upon the vesting of equity-based awards.\nBorrowings and repayments on Line of Credit\nIn March 2017, a customer drew on an LC related to an equipment system in the amount of $0.8 million, which was funded by borrowing availability under the Line of Credit.

If no additional RC facilities become invested in the future, the deferred liability balance would decrease and interest payments, assuming no changes in the applicable tax and interest rates, would also decrease throughout the periods in the table above.\nOutstanding letters of credit were historically issued in connection with equipment sales agreements, collateral support for future obligations due under the Royalty Award and other items. There were no outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2018.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuring 2018 and 2017, we did not engage in any off-balance sheet financing activities other than those included in the Contractual Obligations\u201d discussion above and those reflected in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. In presenting our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"U.S. GAAP\"), we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein. Several of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events. Our estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe that the accounting estimates discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these estimates relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation process requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and certain obligations. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience, market conditions and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to:\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>future expected cash flows from revenues;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>historical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenues from acquired customers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the acquired company's developed technology as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired developed technology will continue to be used in the combined company's product portfolio;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the expected use and useful lives of the acquired assets; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>valuation methods and discount rates used in estimating the values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Carrying value of long-lived assets;\nWe review and evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is measured and recorded based on the estimated fair value of the long-lived assets being tested for impairment and their carrying amounts. Fair value is\ntypically determined through the use of an income approach utilizing estimates of discounted pre-tax future cash flows or a market approach utilizing recent transaction activity for comparable properties.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nWe grant certain executives stock options that generally vest based on performance measures and the grantee's continuous service with us. Compensation expense is recognized for these options on a straight-line basis over the estimated service period based on the estimated fair value at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes model. Different estimates of key inputs in the Black-Scholes model such as the expected term of an option and the expected volatility of our stock price, the estimate of dividends, as well as the estimate of the service period, could impact the share-based compensation expense we would recognize over the award period in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Refer to Note 10 of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information regarding our stock option awards.\nAsset Retirement Obligation\nReclamation costs are allocated to expense over the life of the related mine assets and are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation costs. Reclamation obligations are based on when the spending for an existing environmental disturbance will occur. We review, on at least an annual basis, the reclamation obligation at the mine.\nRemediation costs are accrued based on management's best estimate at the end of each period of the costs expected to be incurred at the mine site. Such cost estimates may include ongoing care, maintenance and monitoring costs.\nAccounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to the mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. Any such changes in future costs, the timing of reclamation activities, scope, or the exclusion of certain costs not considered reclamation and remediation costs, could materially impact the amounts charged to earnings for reclamation and remediation. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes as required by U.S. GAAP, under which management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and the related balance sheet amounts. This judgment includes estimating and analyzing historical and projected future operating results, the reversal of taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies, and the ultimate outcome of uncertain income tax positions. Actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. Tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. Changes in the estimates and assumptions used for calculating income tax expense and potential differences in actual results from estimates could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of recent operations.\nWe establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets when, based upon the weight of all available evidence, we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we have established valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets that, in our judgment, will not be realized. In making this determination, we have considered the relative impact of all of the available positive and negative evidence regarding future sources of taxable income and tax planning strategies. However, there could be a material impact to our effective tax rate if there is a significant change in our estimates of future taxable income and tax planning strategies. If and when our estimates change, or there is a change in the gross balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities causing the need to reassess the realizability of deferred tax assets, then the valuation allowances are adjusted through the provision for income taxes in the period in which this determination is made. Refer to Note 13 of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information regarding our net deferred tax assets and related income tax expense (benefit).\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nRefer to Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for information regarding recently issued accounting

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nThis Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 is filed by Advanced Emissions Solutions, Inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, \"ADES,\" the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" or \"our\" unless the context indicates otherwise).\nWe are a leader in emissions reductions technologies through consumables that utilize powdered activated carbon ( PAC\u201d) and chemical based technologies, primarily serving the coal-fired power generation and industrial boiler industries. Our proprietary environmental technologies and specialty chemicals enable our customers to reduce emissions of mercury and other pollutants, maximize utilization levels and improve operating efficiencies to meet the challenges of existing and potential emissions control regulations. See further discussion of our business included in Item 1 - \"Business\" (\"Item 1\") of this Report. Discussion regarding segment information is included within the discussion of our consolidated results under this Item 7. Additionally, discussion related to our reportable segments is included in Item 1 and Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nOn December 7, 2018 (the Acquisition Date\u201d), we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests (the \"Carbon Solutions Acquisition\u201d) of ADA Carbon Solutions, LLC ( CS\u201d or Carbon Solutions\u201d). Carbon Solutions is an activated carbon company and the North American leader in mercury capture using powdered activated carbon for the coal-fired power plant, industrial and water treatment markets. Carbon Solutions owns and operates an activated carbon ( AC\u201d) manufacturing and processing facility. It also owns an associated lignite mine that supplies the raw material for the powdered activated carbon plant ( Five Forks Mine\u201d). Our operating results for 2018 include the operating results of Carbon Solutions for the period from December 7, 2018 to December 31, 2018.\nOn December 7, 2018, ADES and ADA-ES, Inc. (\"ADA\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary, and certain other subsidiaries of the Company as guarantors, The Bank of New York Mellon as administrative agent, and Apollo Credit Strategies Master Fund Ltd. and Apollo A-N Credit Fund (Delaware) L.P. (collectively \"Apollo\u201d), affiliates of a beneficial owner of greater than five percent of the Company's common stock and related parties, entered into the Term Loan and Security Agreement (the \"Senior Term Loan\") in the principal amount of $70.0 million, less original issue discount of $2.1 million. Proceeds from the Senior Term Loan were used to fund the Carbon Solutions Acquisition.\nComponents of Revenue, Expenses and Equity Method Investees\nThe following briefly describes the components of revenues and expenses as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Descriptions of the revenue recognition policies are included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nRevenues and costs of revenue\nConsumables\nWe sell PAC and proprietary chemical blends to coal-fired utilities and other industrial boilers that allow the respective utilities to comply with the regulatory emissions standards. Additionally, we also sell PAC to water treatment plants to remove contaminants from the water. Revenue is generally recorded upon delivery of our product.\nCertain customer contracts are comprised of evaluation tests (\"Evaluation Tests\") of the Company's chemicals' effectiveness and efficiency in reducing emissions and entail the delivery of products to the customer and the Company evaluating results of emissions reduction over the term of the contract. The Company generally recognizes revenue from Evaluation Tests over the duration of the contract based on the cost of product consumed by the customer.\nLicense royalties, related party\nWe license our M-45TM and M-45-PCTM emission control technologies (\"M-45 License\") to Tinuum Group and realize royalty income based upon a percentage of the per-ton, pre-tax margin as defined in the M-45 License.\nEquipment sales\nEquipment sales represent the sale of activated carbon injection (\"ACI\") systems to control mercury, dry sorbent injection (\"DSI\") systems to control sulfur dioxide (SO2), sulfur trioxide (SO3), and hydrogen chloride (HCl) and electrostatic precipitator (\"ESP\") liquid flue gas conditioning systems. Revenue from extended equipment contracts was recorded using the completed contract method of accounting.\nWe also may enter into other non-extended equipment contracts for which we generally recognize revenues on a time and material basis as services to build equipment systems are performed or as equipment is delivered.\nOther Operating Expenses\nPayroll and benefits\nPayroll and benefits costs include personnel related fringe benefits, sales and administrative staff labor costs and stock compensation expenses. Payroll and benefits costs exclude direct labor included in Cost of revenue.\nRent and occupancy\nRent and occupancy costs include rent, insurance, and other occupancy-related expenses.\nLegal and professional fees\nLegal and professional costs include external legal, audit and consulting expenses.\nGeneral and administrative\nGeneral and administrative costs include director fees and expenses, bad debt expense, research and development expense and other general costs of conducting business. Research and development costs, net of reimbursements from cost-sharing arrangements, are charged to expense in the period incurred and are reported in the General and administrative line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nDepreciation, amortization, depletion, and accretion\nDepreciation and amortization expense consists of depreciation expense related to property, plant and equipment and the amortization of long-lived intangibles. Depletion and accretion expense consists of depletion expense related to the depletion of mine development costs and the accretion of a mine reclamation liability.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nEarnings from equity method investments\nEarnings from equity method investments relates to our share of earnings (losses) related to our equity method investments.\nOur equity method earnings in Tinuum Group, LLC (\"Tinuum Group\"), a related party in which we own a 42.5% equity interest and a 50% voting interest, are positively impacted when Tinuum Group obtains an investor in a refined coal (\"RC\") facility and receives lease payments from the lessee, or purchase payments from the sale, of the RC facility. If Tinuum Group operates a retained RC facility, the Company's equity method earnings will be negatively impacted as operating retained RC facilities generate operating losses. However, we benefit on an after-tax basis if we are able to utilize tax credits associated with the production and sale of RC from operation of retained RC facilities by Tinuum Group. These benefits, if utilized, will increase our consolidated net income as a result of a reduction in income tax expense.\nTinuum Services, LLC (\"Tinuum Services\"), a related party in which we own both a 50% equity and voting interest, operates and maintains RC facilities under operating and maintenance agreements. Tinuum Group or the lessee/owner of the RC facilities pays Tinuum Services, subject to certain limitations, the costs of operating and maintaining the RC facilities plus certain fees. Tinuum Services also arranges for the purchase and delivery of certain chemical additives under chemical agency agreements necessary for the production of RC. Tinuum Services consolidates certain RC facilities leased or owned by tax equity investors that are deemed to be variable interest entities (\"VIE's). All net income (loss) associated with these VIE's is allocated to the noncontrolling equity holders of Tinuum Services and therefore does not impact our equity earnings (loss) from Tinuum Services.\nOther income (expense)\nThe remaining components of other income (expense) include interest income, interest expense and other miscellaneous items. For 2017, miscellaneous items included an adjustment to a litigation loss accrual and changes in estimate related to royalty indemnity expense.\nWe record interest expense related to our Senior Term Loan and capital leases, as well as through our share of Tinuum Group's equity method earnings for RC facility leases or sales that are treated as installment sales for tax purposes. IRC Section 453A (\"Section 453A\") requires taxpayers using the installment method to pay an interest charge on the portion of the tax liability that is deferred under the installment method. We refer to this as \"453A interest.\"\nResults of Operations\nFor comparison purposes, the following tables set forth our results of operations for the years presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. The results for the year ended December 31, 2018 include the results of operations of Carbon Solutions from the Acquisition Date through December 31. The year-to-year comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of financial results that may be achieved in future years.\nYear ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year ended December 31, 2017\nTotal Revenue and Cost of Revenue\nA summary of the components of revenues and cost of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\n\nConsumables and consumables cost of revenue\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, consumables revenue increased year over year primarily due to the Carbon Solutions Acquisition on December 7, 2018. Carbon Solutions contributed consumables revenue of $5.6 million of the total consumables revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. Excluding Carbon Solutions' consumables revenues, consumables revenues decreased year over year primarily due to a significant decrease in sales to two customers, partially offset by increased sales to new customers in 2018. The total pounds of our chemicals sold decreased year over year and gross margins decreased year over year primarily due to ongoing price compression. During the year ended December 31, 2018, revenues from Evaluation Tests increased year over year primarily from two significant customer contracts that were completed in 2018. Cost of consumables revenue for Carbon Solutions for 2018 was $3.4 million and excluding this amount cost of consumables revenue increased year over year. This increase was primarily due to significant costs incurred that exceeded revenues by $0.5 million on one of the Evaluation Test contracts, which was the primary negative impact on our overall consumables gross margin for 2018.\nConsumables cost of revenue will be negatively impacted in 2019 due to the amortization of a step-up in inventory fair value of approximately $5.0 million related to the Carbon Solutions Acquisition.\nLicense royalties, related party\nRoyalty income increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to Tinuum Group obtaining tax equity investors for two incremental RC facilities during 2018 and to the full year of operations in 2018 of the four incremental RC facilities sold or leased to tax equity investors in 2017, all of which use our M-45 License. The total facilities that use our M-45 License increased from 10 facilities in 2017 to 12 facilities in 2018. The increase in facilities resulted in an increase in rental and sales payments to Tinuum Group and an increase in the related tons produced and sold subject to the M-45 License. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were 37.3 million tons and 22.6 million tons, respectively, of RC produced using the M-45 License.\nEquipment sales and Equipment sales cost of revenue\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we did not enter into any long-term (6 months or longer) fixed price contracts to supply ACI systems. As of December 31, 2017, all ACI system contracts were completed. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed four ACI systems, recognizing revenues of $3.4 million and cost of revenue of $2.4 million.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we did not enter into any long term (6 months or longer) fixed price contracts to supply DSI systems. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed five DSI systems, recognizing revenues of $27.8 million and cost of revenue of $26.0 million. As of January 1, 2018, all revenues and costs of revenues were recognized on the three DSI system uncompleted contracts as of December 31, 2017 upon the adoption of the new revenue accounting standard, ASC 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\nThe remaining changes were due to other equipment sales.\nDemand for ACI and DSI system contracts historically was driven by coal-fired power plant utilities that need to comply with Federal Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (\"MATS\") and Maximum Achievable Control Technology Standards (\"MACT\"). As\nthe deadline for these standards has passed, we do not expect to enter into any future long-term fixed price contracts for ACI and DSI systems.\nAdditional information related to revenue concentrations and contributions by class and reportable segment can be found within the segment discussion below and in Note 6 and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nOther Operating Expenses\nA summary of the components of our operating expenses, exclusive of cost of revenue items (presented above), for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\n\nPayroll and benefits\nPayroll and benefits expenses increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to restructuring expenses in connection with the departure of certain executive officers and management's alignment of the business with strategic objectives during 2018, as well as the elimination of certain duplicative positions in connection with the Carbon Solutions Acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded net restructuring charges of $3.1 million. As of December 31, 2018, $2.2 million of this expense remained accrued. Payment of accrued amounts is expected to occur during 2019 from cash on hand. There were no material restructuring expenses recorded in 2017. Additionally, payroll-related expenses increased due to the increase in headcount of personnel from the Carbon Solutions Acquisition, which resulted in an increase in average headcount of 10% for 2018 compared to 2017. We expect an increase in future recurring payroll-related expense due to the Carbon Solutions Acquisition.\nRent and occupancy\nRent and occupancy expenses increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to lower rent and occupancy expense in 2017 as a result of the relocation of our corporate headquarters in the first quarter of 2017 and the acceleration of deferred rent and tenant improvement allowances recorded in 2017 associated with the termination of the lease agreement of our former corporate headquarters.\nLegal and professional fees\nLegal and professional fees expenses increased in 2018 compared to 2017 as a result of costs incurred related to the Carbon Solutions Acquisition of approximately $4.5 million as well as an increase in consulting fees related to ongoing clarification of federal income tax reform of $0.5 million. These costs were partially offset by a decrease in costs related to outsourced shared service costs, including legal and audit fees.\nGeneral and administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to a $0.4 million reserve on an asset related to a letter of credit drawn by a former customer that was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017. Additional decreases included a reduction in general operating expenses of approximately $0.4 million, which included decreases in outsourced IT costs and outside director expenses. Offsetting these decreases was an increase in bad debt expense incurred of $0.2 million.\nDepreciation, amortization, depletion, and accretion\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to higher depreciation recorded in 2017 related to the acceleration of depreciation on certain fixed assets that were disposed of in connection with our corporate office relocation, which was completed in the first quarter of 2017. This decrease is offset by the addition of long-lived assets\nacquired as part of the Carbon Solutions Acquisition, which contributed approximately $0.4 million of depreciation expense for the period between Acquisition Date and December 31, 2018.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nA summary of the components of our other income (expense), net for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows: \nEarnings in equity method investments\nThe following table presents the equity method earnings, by investee, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017: \nEarnings from equity method investments, and changes related thereto, are impacted by our most significant equity method investees: Tinuum Group and Tinuum Services. Earnings from equity method investments increased during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 primarily as a result of the addition of two invested facilities during 2018. However, cash distributions to us from Tinuum Group, and related equity earnings, during 2018 were negatively impacted as a result of $17.6 million of capital expenditures incurred by Tinuum Group related to the engineering and installation of RC facilities. See the discussion below regarding the accounting of earnings from Tinuum Group.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $47.2 million in equity earnings from Tinuum Group compared to our proportionate share of Tinuum Group's net income of $57.7 million for the year. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized $48.9 million in equity earnings from Tinuum Group compared to our proportionate share of Tinuum Group's net income of $46.6 million for the year. The difference between our pro-rata share of Tinuum Group's net income and our earnings from our Tinuum Group equity method investment as reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations relates to us receiving cumulative distributions in excess of the carrying value of the investment, and therefore recognizing such excess distributions as equity method earnings in the period the distributions occur, as discussed in more detail below.\nAs a result of cash flows from invested RC facilities, Tinuum Group distributions to us during the year ended December 31, 2018 were $47.2 million, which resulted in us continuing to have cumulative cash distributions that exceeded our cumulative pro-rata share of Tinuum Group's net income as of December 31, 2018.\nThe following table for Tinuum Group presents our investment balance, equity earnings, cash distributions received and cash distributions in excess of the investment balance for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands): \n(1) The amounts of our 42.5% proportionate share of net income as shown in the table above differ from mathematical calculations of the Company's 42.5% equity interest in Tinuum Group multiplied by the amounts of Net Income available to Class A members as shown in the table above of Tinuum Group results of operations due to adjustments related to the Class B preferred return.\nTinuum Group plans to adopt Accounting Standard Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09 (Topic 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09\u201d) and ASU 2016-02 (Topic 842), Leases ( ASU 2016-02\u201d) as of January 1, 2019. As a result of Tinuum Group's adoption, we expect to record a cumulative adjustment of $37.2 million related to our portion of Tinuum Group's cumulative effect adjustment that will increase our Retained Earnings as of January 1, 2019. We expect that this adjustment will result in us no longer having cumulative cash distributions that exceed our cumulative pro-rata share of Tinuum Group's net income. Additionally, we expect that we will recognize equity earnings by recording our pro-rata share of Tinuum Group's net income rather than based upon cash distributions on a go-forward basis. Upon adoption, we will assess the impact of the adjustment to our income tax position.\nTinuum Group's consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are included in Item 15 of this Report.\nEquity earnings from our interest in Tinuum Services increased by $2.1 million in 2018 compared to 2017. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, Tinuum Services provided operating and maintenance services to 18 and 16 RC facilities, respectively. Tinuum Services derives earnings from both fixed-fee arrangements as well as fees that are tied to actual RC production, depending upon the specific RC facility operating and maintenance agreement.\nAdditional information related to equity method investments can be found in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nTax Credits\nWe earned the following tax credits that may be available for future benefit related to the production of RC from the operation of retained RC facilities under the Internal Revenue Code (\"IRC\") Section 45 - Production Tax Credit (\"Section 45 tax credits\"): \nThe increase in the Section 45 tax credits earned during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 was due to our direct ownership and Tinuum Group's ownership in an RC facility that generated tax credits for the entirety of 2018 compared to a six-month period in 2017.\nAs discussed in Item 1 of this Report, Tinuum Group operates and leases or sells facilities used in the production and sale of RC to third party tax equity investors. All dispositions of such facilities are treated as installment sales for federal income tax purposes at Tinuum Group. The resulting gain from these sales is reported by Tinuum Group pursuant to the installment method under IRC Section 453. Under Section 453A taxpayers using the installment method for income tax purposes are required to pay 453A interest that is calculated on the portion of the tax liability that is deferred under the installment method. As of December 31, 2018, ADES's allocable share of the gross deferred installment sale gain from Tinuum Group to be recognized in future years was approximately $170 million.\nDue to the production and sale of RC from the operation of retained RC facilities, Tinuum Group has generated Section 45 tax credits (\"GBC's\"). These GBC's are allocated to the owners of Tinuum Group, including us, who may benefit to the extent that the GBC's are realized from the operation of retained RC facilities. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $104.6 million in GBC carryforwards.\nIn the hypothetical event of an ownership change, as defined by IRC Section 382, utilization of the GBC's generated prior to the change would be subject to an annual limitation imposed by IRC Section 383 for GBC's. The results of a recent analysis indicated that we had not experienced an ownership change as of December 31, 2018, as defined by IRC Section 382. Such analysis for the period from January 1, 2019 through the date of this Report has not been completed. Therefore, it is possible that we experienced an ownership change between January 1, 2019 and the date of this filing, thus subjecting our GBC carryforwards to limitation. Should a limitation exist, however, we would likely be in a position to substantially increase the limitation amount by virtue of our approximately $170 million deferred installment sale gain at Tinuum Group.\nSpecifically, IRC Section 382 provides that a corporation with a net unrealized built-in gain (\"NUBIG\") immediately before an ownership change may increase its limitation by the amount of recognized built-in gain (\"RBIG\") arising from the sale of a built-in gain asset during a recognition period, which is generally the five-year period immediately following an ownership change. Built-in gain reported on the installment sale method that is attributable to assets sold by the corporation before or during the recognition period may increase the corporation's limitation during and after the recognition period. Therefore, it is likely that any IRC Section 382 limitation imposed upon an ownership change may be increased by our share of RBIG from Tinuum Group's installment sale gain attributable to RC facilities sold before or during the period in which the change in ownership occurred.\nThere are numerous assumptions, listed below, that must be considered in calculating the RBIG related to Tinuum Group and the increase to our IRC Section 383 limitation. Assuming these assumptions, we may be able to increase the total limitation by approximately $170 million over the duration of the installment sale. As of December 31, 2018, after increasing the total hypothetical limitation, we would likely not have been able to utilize approximately $43.0 million of tax credits.\n \u2022 The Tinuum Group RBIG is a result of the sale of RC facilities by Tinuum Group and its election to utilize the installment sale method for tax purposes; \n \u2022 Investors in RC facilities will not terminate existing contracts as completion of an installment sale transaction is necessary to realize RBIG; \n \u2022 We have no net unrealized built-in loss to offset the NUBIG from Tinuum Group; \n \u2022 Our RBIG is equal to the deferred gain allocated from Tinuum Group, which is approximately $170 million; \n \u2022 We will have a NUBIG immediately before a hypothetical ownership change such that the Tinuum Group RBIG is available to increase the IRC Section 382 limitation; \n \u2022 We will continue our historic business operations for at least two years following a hypothetical ownership change; and \n \u2022 A second ownership change does not occur.  The annual limitation will be increased by the amount of RBIG that is included in taxable income each year.\nInterest expense\n453A interest expense decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 by $1.0 million. This reduction was driven by a lower tax rate of 21% in 2018 compared to 35% in 2017 as well as fewer principal payments remaining, partially offset by an increase in invested RC facilities in which Tinuum Group recognized as installment sales for tax purposes from 17 as of December 31, 2017 to 19 as of December 31, 2018.\nThe following table shows the balance of the tax liability that has been deferred and the applicable interest rate to calculate 453A interest:\n\n(1) Represents the approximate tax effected liability utilizing the federal tax rate in effect for the applicable years ended related to the deferred gain on installment sales (approximately $170 million as of December 31, 2018).\nBased on the interest rate in effect as of the date of this filing, the 453A interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 is expected to be 6%.\nOffsetting the decrease in 453A interest expense was an increase due to $0.5 million in interest related to the Senior Term Loan entered into on December 7, 2018 to fund the Carbon Solutions Acquisition.\nOther\nThe components of Other income (expense) include the following significant items:\nIndemnity Settlement Agreement\nIn December 2017, prior to the Carbon Solutions Acquisition, we, Carbon Solutions and the former parent company of Carbon Solutions agreed to terminate certain provisions of the Indemnity Settlement Agreement (the \" Indemnity Termination Agreement\"). Pursuant to an agreement executed concurrently with the Indemnity Termination Agreement, the Company, Norit International B.V. and one of its an affiliates (collectively referred to as Norit\u201d) agreed to a final payment in the amount of $3.3 million (the \"Settlement Payment\") to settle all outstanding royalty obligations (the \"Royalty Award\") owed under the terms of a settlement agreement executed in 2011 between the Company and Norit. We paid this amount on December 29, 2017.\nUnder the Indemnity Termination Agreement, and upon payment of the Settlement Payment, we were relieved of certain financial and indemnity obligations required by the terms of the settlement agreement with Norit, including the obligation to maintain LC's securing future royalty payment obligations. As of December 31, 2017, $3.5 million in LC's related to the Royalty Award were outstanding, but were canceled by all parties in January 2018, pursuant to the Indemnity Termination Agreement.\nSettlement with service provider\nIn November 2017, we entered into a settlement agreement with a former third-party service provider and as part of the settlement we received cash in the amount of $3.5 million. Cash from this settlement was received in December 2017.\nAdvanced Emission Solutions, Inc. Profit Sharing Retirement Plan\nIn 2016, the DOL opened an investigation into the Advanced Emissions Solutions, Inc. Profit Sharing Retirement Plan (the 401(k) Plan\u201d), and we, as Plan Sponsor, cooperated with that investigation. In February 2018, as part of ongoing discussions, we and the DOL came to an agreement whereby we would make a restorative payment to the 401(k) Plan in the amount of $1.0 million as an estimate of lost earnings for 401(k) Plan participants as of January 1, 2015. Thereafter, the DOL would close the investigation with no further action against the 401(k) Plan or its fiduciaries, including any further investigation. We determined this contingency to be both probable and reasonably estimable and accrued $1.0 million as of December 31, 2017. The liability was recorded in the Other current liabilities line item on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The expense recognized related to this accrual was included in the Other line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. We made a payment of $1.0 million to the 401(k) Plan on June 1, 2018 and no liability existed as of December 31, 2018. On September 7, 2018, we received notification that the DOL had closed its investigation and no further action is required by us.\nImpairment of cost method investment\nIn November 2014, we acquired an 8% ownership interest in the common stock of Highview (\"Highview\"), a London, England based development stage company specializing in power storage. We accounted for our investment in Highview (the \"Highview Investment\") in accordance with U.S. GAAP applicable to equity investments that do not qualify for the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 2017, we recorded an impairment charge of $0.5 million for the Highview Investment based on an estimated fair value of \u00a31.00 per share compared to the estimated carrying value prior to the impairment charge of \u00a32.00 per share. The impairment charge was included in the Other line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nIncome tax expense\nOn December 22, 2017 (the \"Enactment Date\"), the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"). The Tax Act made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code and key provisions applicable to the Company, or certain of Tinuum Group's existing or potential customers, for 2018 included the following: (1) reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent; (2) elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT); (3) a new limitation on deductible interest expense; (4) limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation; (5) limitations on the use of federal tax credits (\"FTCs\") to reduce the U.S. income tax liability; (6) limitations on net operating losses (\"NOL's\") generated after December 31, 2017, to 80 percent of taxable income; and the introduction of the Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax ( BEAT\u201d) for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017.\nAs a result of the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, we recorded an adjustment to our recorded deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of the Enactment Date for those temporary differences expected to reverse after the Enactment Date. During 2018, we did not make any accounting adjustments related to the Tax Act.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, our reported income tax expense of $10.4 million differed from income tax expense computed by applying the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate (the \"Federal Rate\") of $9.6 million primarily due to a reduction in income tax expense from tax credits realized of $7.0 million, offset by increases in income tax expense from state income tax expense, net of federal benefit of $3.6 million and an increase in the valuation adjustment on our deferred tax assets of $4.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our reported income tax expense of $24.2 million differed from income tax expense computed using the Federal Rate of $18.2 million primarily due to increases in income tax expense from state income tax expense, net of federal benefit of $1.7 million and from a reduction in our net deferred tax assets of $5.8 million from the change in federal tax rates from 35% to 21%, offset by a decrease in income tax expense from tax credits realized of $1.9 million.\nAccounting for income taxes requires that companies assess whether a valuation allowance should be recorded against their deferred tax asset based on an assessment of the amount of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not\u201d to be realized. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nWe assess the valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets at each reporting date. The determination of whether a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is appropriate requires the evaluation of positive and negative evidence that can be objectively verified. Consideration must be given to all sources of taxable income available to realize the deferred tax asset, including, as applicable, the future reversal of existing temporary differences, future taxable income forecasts exclusive of the reversal of temporary differences and carryforwards, taxable income in carryback years and tax planning strategies. In estimating taxes, we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions taking into account statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we concluded it is more likely than not we will generate sufficient taxable income within the applicable NOL and tax credit carry-forward periods to realize $32.5 million of our net deferred tax assets, and therefore, reversed $4.5 million of the valuation allowance. In reaching this conclusion, we most significantly considered: (1) forecasts of continued future taxable income and (2) impacts of additional RC invested facilities during 2018. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had a valuation allowance recorded of $79.9 million and $75.4 million, respectively, against our deferred tax assets.\nDuring 2019, due to the impact of Tinuum Group selling an additional RC facility during the three months ended March 31, 2019, as well as the impacts of Tinuum Group's adoption of ASU 2014-09 and ASU 2016-02, we expect that we will record an adjustment to our valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets.\nThe ability to recognize the remaining deferred tax assets that continue to be subject to a valuation allowance is evaluated on a quarterly basis to determine if there are any significant events that would affect the ability to utilize those deferred tax assets.\nOur estimate of future taxable income is based on internal projections that consider historical performance, multiple internal scenarios and assumptions, as well as external data that we believe is reasonable. If events are identified that affect our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, or if additional deferred tax assets are generated, the analysis will be updated to determine if any\nadjustments to the valuation allowance are required. If actual results differ negatively from the current estimates of future taxable income, even if caused by adverse macro-economic conditions, the remaining valuation allowance may need to be increased. Such an increase could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Conversely, better than expected results and continued positive results and trends could result in further releases to the deferred tax valuation allowance, and any such decreases could have a material positive effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSee additional discussion in Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nBusiness Segments\nAs of December 31, 2018, we have two reportable segments: (1) Refined Coal (\"RC'); and (2) Power Generation and Industrials (\"PGI\") (f/k/a \"Emissions Control\").\nThe business segment measurements provided to and evaluated by our chief operating decision maker are computed in accordance with the principles listed below:\n \u2022 The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies except as described below. \n \u2022 Segment revenues include equity method earnings and losses from our equity method investments. \n \u2022 Segment operating income (loss) includes segment revenues, gains related to sales of equity method investments and allocation of certain \"Corporate general and administrative expenses,\" which include Payroll and benefits, Rent and occupancy, Legal and professional fees, and General and administrative. \n \u2022 RC segment operating income includes interest expense directly attributable to the RC segment.  The principal products and services of our segments are:\n 1. RC - Our RC segment derives its earnings from equity method investments as well as royalty payment streams and other revenues related to enhanced combustion of and reduced emissions of both NOX and mercury from the burning of RC. Our equity method investments related to the RC segment include Tinuum Group, Tinuum Services as well as other immaterial equity method investments. Segment revenues include equity method earnings (losses) from our equity method investments and royalty earnings from Tinuum Group. These earnings are included within the Earnings from equity method investments and License royalties, related party line items in the Consolidated Statements of Operations included in Item 8 of this Report. Key drivers to RC segment performance are the produced and sold RC from both operating and retained RC facilities, royalty-bearing tonnage, and the number of operating (leased or sold) and retained RC facilities. These key drivers impact our earnings and cash distributions from equity method investments. \n 2. PGI - Our PGI segment includes revenues and related expenses from the sale of consumable products that utilize PAC and chemical technologies as well as historically the sale of ACI and DSI equipment systems. These options provide coal-powered utilities and industrial boilers with mercury control solutions working in conjunction with ACI and DSI systems and other pollution control equipment, generally without the requirement for significant ongoing capital outlays. These amounts are included within the respective revenue and cost of revenue line items in the Consolidated Statements of Operations included in Item 8 of this Report. \nThe following table presents our operating segment results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\n\n(1) Included within the RC segment operating income for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is 453A interest expense of $1.6 million and $2.6 million, respectively. Also included within the RC segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $0.4 million of severance expense.\n(2) Included within the PGI segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately $1.0 million of amortization related to a step up in basis of the fair value of inventory. Also included within the PGI segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $1.0 million of severance expense.\nA reconciliation of segment operating income to consolidated net income is included in Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nRC\nThe following table details the segment revenues of our respective equity method investments for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\n\nRC earnings increased primarily due to increased equity earnings from Tinuum Services during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, as presented above. Our equity earnings increased primarily due to an increase in Tinuum Services' earnings as a result of the addition of two invested facilities. Cash distributions decreased year over year as a result of incurred costs related to the engineering and installation phases of RC facilities, which have reduced distributions to Tinuum Group's equity members even though Tinuum Group did obtain two additional invested facilities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Tinuum Group's consolidated earnings increased $26.0 million from the comparable December 31, 2017 period due to an increase in lease revenues driven by increased sales of facilities to third-party investors.\nAs discussed above and in Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report, our earnings in Tinuum Group may not equal our pro-rata share due to the accounting related to our equity method investment.\nRC operating income in 2018 was also positively impacted for the following:\n \u2022 An increase in earnings from Tinuum Services, which was primarily due to an increase in the number of RC facilities operated by Tinuum Services during 2018; \n \u2022 An increase in M-45 royalties earned as a result of increased tonnage; and \n \u2022 A decrease in 453A interest expense as a result of the decreased federal tax rate and the declining deferred tax liability.  PGI\nPGI segment operating income decreased during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to a decrease in revenues year over year, as discussed within the consolidated results. The decrease in PGI segment operating income was driven by a decrease in Equipment sales revenue, less equipment sales cost of revenue, as no further revenue from equipment sales is expected. Additionally, PGI operating income was positively impacted by incremental Carbon Solutions revenues of $5.6 million, offset by cost of revenues of $3.4 million, inclusive of $1.0 million related to the amortization of a step up in basis of acquired finished goods inventory related to Carbon Solutions Acquisition. The decrease in operating income is also due to an increase in restructuring expense of $0.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview of Factors Affecting Our Liquidity\nDuring 2018, our liquidity position was positively affected primarily from distributions from Tinuum Group and Tinuum Services, royalty payments from Tinuum Group and borrowing availability under our bank (\"Lender\") line of credit (the \"Line of Credit\").\nOur principal sources of liquidity currently include:\n \u2022 cash and cash equivalents on hand; \n \u2022 distributions from Tinuum Group and Tinuum Services; \n \u2022 royalty payments from Tinuum Group; \n \u2022 the Line of Credit; and \n \u2022 operations in the PGI segment.  Our principal uses of liquidity during the year ended December 31, 2018 included:\n \u2022 acquisition of Carbon Solutions \n \u2022 payment of dividends; \n \u2022 repurchases of shares of our common stock pursuant to a stock repurchase program by which we may repurchase up to $20.0 million of our outstanding common stock, from time to time; \n \u2022 our business operating expenses, including federal and state tax payments; and \n \u2022 delivering on our existing contracts and customer commitments.  Our ability to continue to generate sufficient cash flow required to meet ongoing operational needs and obligations, as well as future expected dividend payments and potential future share repurchases, depends upon several factors, including executing on our contracts and initiatives, receiving royalty payments from Tinuum Group and distributions from Tinuum Group and Tinuum Services, and increasing our share of the market for PGI consumables as well as expansion of our overall PAC business into additional adjacent markets. Increased distributions from Tinuum Group will likely be dependent upon both preserving existing contractual relationships and the securing of additional tax equity investors for those Tinuum Group facilities that are currently not operating.\nOur use of liquidity for capital expenditures has not been significant for the periods presented. Due to the acquisition of Carbon Solutions, we expect that use of liquidity for capital expenditures will increase in future periods. Carbon Solutions has historically incurred costs for capital expenditures related to the PAC manufacturing facility under normal operations and planned outages and for mine development at the Five Forks. Certain of Carbon Solutions' recent historical planned capital expenditures were delayed due to the sales process. During due diligence and validated upon acquisition, we evaluated capital expenditure needs and anticipate additional material capital resources will be needed to maintain or improve capital assets.\nTinuum Group and Tinuum Services Distributions\nThe following table summarizes the cash distributions from our equity method investments, which most significantly affected our consolidated cash flow results, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\n\nFuture cash flows from Tinuum through 2021 are expected to range from $200 to $225 million, and key drivers in achieving these future cash flows are based on the following:\n \u2022 19 invested facilities as of December 31, 2018 and inclusive of all net Tinuum cash flows (distributions and license royalties), offset by estimated federal and state income tax payments and 453A interest payments.  Expected future cash flows from Tinuum Group are based on the following key assumptions:\n \u2022 Tinuum Group continues to not operate retained facilities; \n \u2022 Tinuum Group does not have material capital expenditures or unusual operating expenses; \n \u2022 Tax equity lease renewals on invested facilities are not terminated or repriced; and \n \u2022 Coal-fired power generation remains constant.  Future incremental invested RC facilities would positively impact our expectation of future cash flows.\nSenior Term Loan\nOn December 7, 2018, we executed the Senior Term Loan with Apollo in the principal amount of $70.0 million, less original issue discount of $2.1 million. We also paid debt issuance costs of $2.0 million related to the Senior Term Loan. The Senior Term Loan has a term of 36 months and bears interest at a rate equal to 3-month LIBOR (subject to a 1.5% floor) + 4.75% per annum, which is adjusted quarterly to the current 3-month LIBOR rate, and interest is payable quarterly in arrears. Quarterly principal payments of $6.0 million are required beginning in March 2019, and we may prepay the Senior Term Loan at any time without penalty. The Senior Term Loan is secured by substantially all of our assets, including the cash flows from Tinuum Group and Tinuum Services, but excluding our equity interests in those Tinuum entities.\nThe Senior Term Loan includes, among others, the following covenants: (1) Beginning December 31, 2018 and as of the end of each fiscal quarter thereafter, we must maintain a minimum cash balance of $5.0 million and shall not permit \"expected future net cash flows from the refined coal business\" (as defined in the Senior Term Loan) to be less than 1.75 times the outstanding principal amount of the Senior Term Loan; (2) Beginning in January 2019, annual collective dividends and buybacks of shares of our common stock in an aggregate amount, not to exceed $30.0 million, are permitted so long as (a) no default or event of default exists under the Senior Term Loan and (b) expected future net cash flows from the refined coal business as of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter exceed $100.0 million.\nStock Repurchases and Dividends\nIn November 2018, the Board authorized us to purchase up to $20.0 million of our outstanding common stock. This stock repurchase program will remain in effect until December 31, 2019 unless otherwise modified by the Board. Previously, in December 2017, the Board had authorized us to purchase up to $20.0 million of our outstanding common stock under a separate repurchase program that was in effect until July 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2018, under these two stock repurchase programs, we purchased 2,350,422 shares of our common stock for cash of $25.3 million, inclusive of commissions and fees.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we declared and paid quarterly cash dividends to stockholders of $20.2 million, which were paid on March 8, 2018, June 8, 2018, September 6, 2018 and December 6, 2018.\nLine of Credit\nAs of December 31, 2018, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Line of Credit.\nOn September 30, 2018, ADA, as borrower, ADES, as guarantor, and the Lender entered into an amendment (the \"Twelfth Amendment\") to the Line of Credit. The Twelfth Amendment decreased the Line of Credit to $5.0 million due to decreased collateral requirements, extended the maturity date of the Line of Credit to September 30, 2020 and permitted the Line of Credit to be used as collateral (in place of restricted cash) for letters of credit (\"LC's\") up to $5.0 million related to equipment projects and certain other agreements. Under the Twelfth Amendment, there was no minimum cash balance requirement based on us meeting certain conditions and maintaining minimum trailing twelve-month EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), as previously defined in the \"Eleventh Amendment\" to the Line of Credit, of $24.0 million.\nOn December 7, 2018, ADA, as borrower, ADES as guarantor, and the Lender entered into an amendment to the Line of Credit, which provided, among other things, for ADA to be able to enter into the Senior Term Loan as a guarantor so long as the principal amount of the Senior Term Loan does not exceed $70 million. Additionally, the financial covenants in the Line of Credit were amended and restated to be consistent with the aforementioned Senior Term Loan covenants, including maintaining a minimum cash balance of $5.0 million.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased from $30.7 million as of December 31, 2017 to $23.8 million as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $6.9 million. The following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively: \nCash flows from operating activities\nCash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $1.9 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 and were positively impacted primarily by the following: (1) an increase in net income of $7.6 million; (2) a change in Legal settlements and accruals due to settlement of obligation results in cash outflow of $16.1 million in 2017; and (3) an increase in Distributions from equity method investees, return on investment of $0.9 million. Offsetting these increases to operating cash flows were primarily the following: (1) a decrease of $17.5 million due to the change in deferred tax assets as a result of utilization to offset taxable income in 2017 and changes to the valuation allowance in 2018; and (2) a net increase in working capital and other liabilities of $4.6 million, primarily due to an increase in receivables from Tinuum Group related to revenues from license royalties and an increase in receivables from customers as a result of the addition of new customers from the Carbons Solutions Acquisition.\nCash flows from investing activities\nDistributions from equity method investees\nOur cash flows from investing activities are significantly impacted by cash distributions from equity method investees that represent a return in excess of cumulative earnings, which decreased from $48.9 million in 2017 to $47.2 million in 2018. All of these cash distributions were received from Tinuum Group.\nAcquisition of business, net of cash acquired\nThe Carbon Solutions Acquisition completed in 2018 resulted in total cash consideration paid of $65.8 million less cash acquired of $3.3 million. In addition, the total purchase consideration included $0.7 million payable to Carbon Solutions' previous debt holder, which was paid in March 2019. Also as part of the Carbon Solutions Acquisition, we also assumed capital leases and other contractual commitments of $11.8 million.\nPurchase of and contribution to equity method investee\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018 we made a contribution to Tinuum Services of $0.8 million due to a capital call.\nCash flows from financing activities\nBorrowings on long-term debt, related party and debt issuance costs paid\nWe funded the Carbon Solutions Acquisition through cash on hand and the proceeds of the Senior Term Loan in", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nThis Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 is filed by Advanced Emissions Solutions, Inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, \"ADES,\" the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" or \"our\" unless the context indicates otherwise).\nWe are a leader in emissions reductions technologies through consumables that utilize powdered activated carbon ( PAC\u201d) and chemical based technologies, primarily serving the coal-fired power generation and industrial boiler industries. Our proprietary environmental technologies and specialty chemicals enable our customers to reduce emissions of mercury and other pollutants, maximize utilization levels and improve operating efficiencies to meet the challenges of existing and potential emissions control regulations. See further discussion of our business included in Item 1 - \"Business\" (\"Item 1\") of this Report. Discussion regarding segment information is included within the discussion of our consolidated results under this Item 7. Additionally, discussion related to our reportable segments is included in Item 1 and Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nOn December 7, 2018 (the Acquisition Date\u201d), we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests (the \"Carbon Solutions Acquisition\u201d) of ADA Carbon Solutions, LLC ( CS\u201d or Carbon Solutions\u201d). Carbon Solutions is an activated carbon company and the North American leader in mercury capture using powdered activated carbon for the coal-fired power plant, industrial and water treatment markets. Carbon Solutions owns and operates an activated carbon ( AC\u201d) manufacturing and processing facility. It also owns an associated lignite mine that supplies the raw material for the powdered activated carbon plant ( Five Forks Mine\u201d). Our operating results for 2018 include the operating results of Carbon Solutions for the period from December 7, 2018 to December 31, 2018.\nOn December 7, 2018, ADES and ADA-ES, Inc. (\"ADA\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary, and certain other subsidiaries of the Company as guarantors, The Bank of New York Mellon as administrative agent, and Apollo Credit Strategies Master Fund Ltd. and Apollo A-N Credit Fund (Delaware) L.P. (collectively \"Apollo\u201d), affiliates of a beneficial owner of greater than five percent of the Company's common stock and related parties, entered into the Term Loan and Security Agreement (the \"Senior Term Loan\") in the principal amount of $70.0 million, less original issue discount of $2.1 million. Proceeds from the Senior Term Loan were used to fund the Carbon Solutions Acquisition.\nComponents of Revenue, Expenses and Equity Method Investees\nThe following briefly describes the components of revenues and expenses as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Descriptions of the revenue recognition policies are included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nRevenues and costs of revenue\nConsumables\nWe sell PAC and proprietary chemical blends to coal-fired utilities and other industrial boilers that allow the respective utilities to comply with the regulatory emissions standards. Additionally, we also sell PAC to water treatment plants to remove contaminants from the water. Revenue is generally recorded upon delivery of our product.\nCertain customer contracts are comprised of evaluation tests (\"Evaluation Tests\") of the Company's chemicals' effectiveness and efficiency in reducing emissions and entail the delivery of products to the customer and the Company evaluating results of emissions reduction over the term of the contract. The Company generally recognizes revenue from Evaluation Tests over the duration of the contract based on the cost of product consumed by the customer.\nLicense royalties, related party\nWe license our M-45TM and M-45-PCTM emission control technologies (\"M-45 License\") to Tinuum Group and realize royalty income based upon a percentage of the per-ton, pre-tax margin as defined in the M-45 License.\nEquipment sales\nEquipment sales represent the sale of activated carbon injection (\"ACI\") systems to control mercury, dry sorbent injection (\"DSI\") systems to control sulfur dioxide (SO2), sulfur trioxide (SO3), and hydrogen chloride (HCl) and electrostatic precipitator (\"ESP\") liquid flue gas conditioning systems. Revenue from extended equipment contracts was recorded using the completed contract method of accounting.\nWe also may enter into other non-extended equipment contracts for which we generally recognize revenues on a time and material basis as services to build equipment systems are performed or as equipment is delivered.\nOther Operating Expenses\nPayroll and benefits\nPayroll and benefits costs include personnel related fringe benefits, sales and administrative staff labor costs and stock compensation expenses. Payroll and benefits costs exclude direct labor included in Cost of revenue.\nRent and occupancy\nRent and occupancy costs include rent, insurance, and other occupancy-related expenses.\nLegal and professional fees\nLegal and professional costs include external legal, audit and consulting expenses.\nGeneral and administrative\nGeneral and administrative costs include director fees and expenses, bad debt expense, research and development expense and other general costs of conducting business. Research and development costs, net of reimbursements from cost-sharing arrangements, are charged to expense in the period incurred and are reported in the General and administrative line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nDepreciation, amortization, depletion, and accretion\nDepreciation and amortization expense consists of depreciation expense related to property, plant and equipment and the amortization of long-lived intangibles. Depletion and accretion expense consists of depletion expense related to the depletion of mine development costs and the accretion of a mine reclamation liability.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nEarnings from equity method investments\nEarnings from equity method investments relates to our share of earnings (losses) related to our equity method investments.\nOur equity method earnings in Tinuum Group, LLC (\"Tinuum Group\"), a related party in which we own a 42.5% equity interest and a 50% voting interest, are positively impacted when Tinuum Group obtains an investor in a refined coal (\"RC\") facility and receives lease payments from the lessee, or purchase payments from the sale, of the RC facility. If Tinuum Group operates a retained RC facility, the Company's equity method earnings will be negatively impacted as operating retained RC facilities generate operating losses. However, we benefit on an after-tax basis if we are able to utilize tax credits associated with the production and sale of RC from operation of retained RC facilities by Tinuum Group. These benefits, if utilized, will increase our consolidated net income as a result of a reduction in income tax expense.\nTinuum Services, LLC (\"Tinuum Services\"), a related party in which we own both a 50% equity and voting interest, operates and maintains RC facilities under operating and maintenance agreements. Tinuum Group or the lessee/owner of the RC facilities pays Tinuum Services, subject to certain limitations, the costs of operating and maintaining the RC facilities plus certain fees. Tinuum Services also arranges for the purchase and delivery of certain chemical additives under chemical agency agreements necessary for the production of RC. Tinuum Services consolidates certain RC facilities leased or owned by tax equity investors that are deemed to be variable interest entities (\"VIE's). All net income (loss) associated with these VIE's is allocated to the noncontrolling equity holders of Tinuum Services and therefore does not impact our equity earnings (loss) from Tinuum Services.\nOther income (expense)\nThe remaining components of other income (expense) include interest income, interest expense and other miscellaneous items. For 2017, miscellaneous items included an adjustment to a litigation loss accrual and changes in estimate related to royalty indemnity expense.\nWe record interest expense related to our Senior Term Loan and capital leases, as well as through our share of Tinuum Group's equity method earnings for RC facility leases or sales that are treated as installment sales for tax purposes. IRC Section 453A (\"Section 453A\") requires taxpayers using the installment method to pay an interest charge on the portion of the tax liability that is deferred under the installment method. We refer to this as \"453A interest.\"\nResults of Operations\nFor comparison purposes, the following tables set forth our results of operations for the years presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. The results for the year ended December 31, 2018 include the results of operations of Carbon Solutions from the Acquisition Date through December 31. The year-to-year comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of financial results that may be achieved in future years.\nYear ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year ended December 31, 2017\nTotal Revenue and Cost of Revenue\nA summary of the components of revenues and cost of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumables\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>License royalties, related party\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equipment sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31,374\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(21,419\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(47\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumables cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equipment cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(353\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(28,804\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(101\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsumables and consumables cost of revenue\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, consumables revenue increased year over year primarily due to the Carbon Solutions Acquisition on December 7, 2018. Carbon Solutions contributed consumables revenue of $5.6 million of the total consumables revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. Excluding Carbon Solutions' consumables revenues, consumables revenues decreased year over year primarily due to a significant decrease in sales to two customers, partially offset by increased sales to new customers in 2018. The total pounds of our chemicals sold decreased year over year and gross margins decreased year over year primarily due to ongoing price compression. During the year ended December 31, 2018, revenues from Evaluation Tests increased year over year primarily from two significant customer contracts that were completed in 2018. Cost of consumables revenue for Carbon Solutions for 2018 was $3.4 million and excluding this amount cost of consumables revenue increased year over year. This increase was primarily due to significant costs incurred that exceeded revenues by $0.5 million on one of the Evaluation Test contracts, which was the primary negative impact on our overall consumables gross margin for 2018.\nConsumables cost of revenue will be negatively impacted in 2019 due to the amortization of a step-up in inventory fair value of approximately $5.0 million related to the Carbon Solutions Acquisition.\nLicense royalties, related party\nRoyalty income increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to Tinuum Group obtaining tax equity investors for two incremental RC facilities during 2018 and to the full year of operations in 2018 of the four incremental RC facilities sold or leased to tax equity investors in 2017, all of which use our M-45 License. The total facilities that use our M-45 License increased from 10 facilities in 2017 to 12 facilities in 2018. The increase in facilities resulted in an increase in rental and sales payments to Tinuum Group and an increase in the related tons produced and sold subject to the M-45 License. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were 37.3 million tons and 22.6 million tons, respectively, of RC produced using the M-45 License.\nEquipment sales and Equipment sales cost of revenue\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we did not enter into any long-term (6 months or longer) fixed price contracts to supply ACI systems. As of December 31, 2017, all ACI system contracts were completed. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed four ACI systems, recognizing revenues of $3.4 million and cost of revenue of $2.4 million.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we did not enter into any long term (6 months or longer) fixed price contracts to supply DSI systems. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed five DSI systems, recognizing revenues of $27.8 million and cost of revenue of $26.0 million. As of January 1, 2018, all revenues and costs of revenues were recognized on the three DSI system uncompleted contracts as of December 31, 2017 upon the adoption of the new revenue accounting standard, ASC 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\nThe remaining changes were due to other equipment sales.\nDemand for ACI and DSI system contracts historically was driven by coal-fired power plant utilities that need to comply with Federal Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (\"MATS\") and Maximum Achievable Control Technology Standards (\"MACT\"). As\nthe deadline for these standards has passed, we do not expect to enter into any future long-term fixed price contracts for ACI and DSI systems.\nAdditional information related to revenue concentrations and contributions by class and reportable segment can be found within the segment discussion below and in Note 6 and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nOther Operating Expenses\nA summary of the components of our operating expenses, exclusive of cost of revenue items (presented above), for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payroll and benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rent and occupancy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legal and professional fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(655\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation, amortization, depletion, and accretion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(66\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPayroll and benefits\nPayroll and benefits expenses increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to restructuring expenses in connection with the departure of certain executive officers and management's alignment of the business with strategic objectives during 2018, as well as the elimination of certain duplicative positions in connection with the Carbon Solutions Acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded net restructuring charges of $3.1 million. As of December 31, 2018, $2.2 million of this expense remained accrued. Payment of accrued amounts is expected to occur during 2019 from cash on hand. There were no material restructuring expenses recorded in 2017. Additionally, payroll-related expenses increased due to the increase in headcount of personnel from the Carbon Solutions Acquisition, which resulted in an increase in average headcount of 10% for 2018 compared to 2017. We expect an increase in future recurring payroll-related expense due to the Carbon Solutions Acquisition.\nRent and occupancy\nRent and occupancy expenses increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to lower rent and occupancy expense in 2017 as a result of the relocation of our corporate headquarters in the first quarter of 2017 and the acceleration of deferred rent and tenant improvement allowances recorded in 2017 associated with the termination of the lease agreement of our former corporate headquarters.\nLegal and professional fees\nLegal and professional fees expenses increased in 2018 compared to 2017 as a result of costs incurred related to the Carbon Solutions Acquisition of approximately $4.5 million as well as an increase in consulting fees related to ongoing clarification of federal income tax reform of $0.5 million. These costs were partially offset by a decrease in costs related to outsourced shared service costs, including legal and audit fees.\nGeneral and administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to a $0.4 million reserve on an asset related to a letter of credit drawn by a former customer that was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017. Additional decreases included a reduction in general operating expenses of approximately $0.4 million, which included decreases in outsourced IT costs and outside director expenses. Offsetting these decreases was an increase in bad debt expense incurred of $0.2 million.\nDepreciation, amortization, depletion, and accretion\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to higher depreciation recorded in 2017 related to the acceleration of depreciation on certain fixed assets that were disposed of in connection with our corporate office relocation, which was completed in the first quarter of 2017. This decrease is offset by the addition of long-lived assets\nacquired as part of the Carbon Solutions Acquisition, which contributed approximately $0.4 million of depreciation expense for the period between Acquisition Date and December 31, 2018.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nA summary of the components of our other income (expense), net for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows: Table 90: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from equity method investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>343\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,151\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,024\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Litigation settlement and royalty indemnity expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,269\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,044\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(101\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,890\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEarnings in equity method investments\nThe following table presents the equity method earnings, by investee, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017: Table 91: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from Tinuum Group\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,700\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from Tinuum Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from equity method investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEarnings from equity method investments, and changes related thereto, are impacted by our most significant equity method investees: Tinuum Group and Tinuum Services. Earnings from equity method investments increased during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 primarily as a result of the addition of two invested facilities during 2018. However, cash distributions to us from Tinuum Group, and related equity earnings, during 2018 were negatively impacted as a result of $17.6 million of capital expenditures incurred by Tinuum Group related to the engineering and installation of RC facilities. See the discussion below regarding the accounting of earnings from Tinuum Group.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $47.2 million in equity earnings from Tinuum Group compared to our proportionate share of Tinuum Group's net income of $57.7 million for the year. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized $48.9 million in equity earnings from Tinuum Group compared to our proportionate share of Tinuum Group's net income of $46.6 million for the year. The difference between our pro-rata share of Tinuum Group's net income and our earnings from our Tinuum Group equity method investment as reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations relates to us receiving cumulative distributions in excess of the carrying value of the investment, and therefore recognizing such excess distributions as equity method earnings in the period the distributions occur, as discussed in more detail below.\nAs a result of cash flows from invested RC facilities, Tinuum Group distributions to us during the year ended December 31, 2018 were $47.2 million, which resulted in us continuing to have cumulative cash distributions that exceeded our cumulative pro-rata share of Tinuum Group's net income as of December 31, 2018.\nThe following table

We expect that this adjustment will result in us no longer having cumulative cash distributions that exceed our cumulative pro-rata share of Tinuum Group's net income. Additionally, we expect that we will recognize equity earnings by recording our pro-rata share of Tinuum Group's net income rather than based upon cash distributions on a go-forward basis. Upon adoption, we will assess the impact of the adjustment to our income tax position.\nTinuum Group's consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are included in Item 15 of this Report.\nEquity earnings from our interest in Tinuum Services increased by $2.1 million in 2018 compared to 2017. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, Tinuum Services provided operating and maintenance services to 18 and 16 RC facilities, respectively. Tinuum Services derives earnings from both fixed-fee arrangements as well as fees that are tied to actual RC production, depending upon the specific RC facility operating and maintenance agreement.\nAdditional information related to equity method investments can be found in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nTax Credits\nWe earned the following tax credits that may be available for future benefit related to the production of RC from the operation of retained RC facilities under the Internal Revenue Code (\"IRC\") Section 45 - Production Tax Credit (\"Section 45 tax credits\"): Table 93: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Section 45 tax credits earned\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in the Section 45 tax credits earned during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 was due to our direct ownership and Tinuum Group's ownership in an RC facility that generated tax credits for the entirety of 2018 compared to a six-month period in 2017.\nAs discussed in Item 1 of this Report, Tinuum Group operates and leases or sells facilities used in the production and sale of RC to third party tax equity investors. All dispositions of such facilities are treated as installment sales for federal income tax purposes at Tinuum Group. The resulting gain from these sales is reported by Tinuum Group pursuant to the installment method under IRC Section 453. Under Section 453A taxpayers using the installment method for income tax purposes are required to pay 453A interest that is calculated on the portion of the tax liability that is deferred under the installment method. As of December 31, 2018, ADES's allocable share of the gross deferred installment sale gain from Tinuum Group to be recognized in future years was approximately $170 million.\nDue to the production and sale of RC from the operation of retained RC facilities, Tinuum Group has generated Section 45 tax credits (\"GBC's\"). These GBC's are allocated to the owners of Tinuum Group, including us, who may benefit to the extent that the GBC's are realized from the operation of retained RC facilities. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $104.6 million in GBC carryforwards.\nIn the hypothetical event of an ownership change, as defined by IRC Section 382, utilization of the GBC's generated prior to the change would be subject to an annual limitation imposed by IRC Section 383 for GBC's. The results of a recent analysis indicated that we had not experienced an ownership change as of December 31, 2018, as defined by IRC Section 382. Such analysis for the period from January 1, 2019 through the date of this Report has not been completed. Therefore, it is possible that we experienced an ownership change between January 1, 2019 and the date of this filing, thus subjecting our GBC carryforwards to limitation. Should a limitation exist, however, we would likely be in a position to substantially increase the limitation amount by virtue of our approximately $170 million deferred installment sale gain at Tinuum Group.\nSpecifically, IRC Section 382 provides that a corporation with a net unrealized built-in gain (\"NUBIG\") immediately before an ownership change may increase its limitation by the amount of recognized built-in gain (\"RBIG\") arising from the sale of a built-in gain asset during a recognition period, which is generally the five-year period immediately following an ownership change. Built-in gain reported on the installment sale method that is attributable to assets sold by the corporation before or during the recognition period may increase the corporation's limitation during and after the recognition period. Therefore, it is likely that any IRC Section 382 limitation imposed upon an ownership change may be increased by our share of RBIG from Tinuum Group's installment sale gain attributable to RC facilities sold before or during the period in which the change in ownership occurred.\nThere are numerous assumptions, listed below, that must be considered in calculating the RBIG related to Tinuum Group and the increase to our IRC Section 383 limitation. Assuming these assumptions, we may be able to increase the total limitation by approximately $170 million over the duration of the installment sale. As of December 31, 2018, after increasing the total hypothetical limitation, we would likely not have been able to utilize approximately $43.0 million of tax credits.\n \u2022 The Tinuum Group RBIG is a result of the sale of RC facilities by Tinuum Group and its election to utilize the installment sale method for tax purposes; \n \u2022 Investors in RC facilities will not terminate existing contracts as completion of an installment sale transaction is necessary to realize RBIG; \n \u2022 We have no net unrealized built-in loss to offset the NUBIG from Tinuum Group; \n \u2022 Our RBIG is equal to the deferred gain allocated from Tinuum Group, which is approximately $170 million; \n \u2022 We will have a NUBIG immediately before a hypothetical ownership change such that the Tinuum Group RBIG is available to increase the IRC Section 382 limitation; \n \u2022 We will continue our historic business operations for at least two years following a hypothetical ownership change; and \n \u2022 A second ownership change does not occur.  The annual limitation will be increased by the amount of RBIG that is included in taxable income each year.\nInterest expense\n453A interest expense decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 by $1.0 million. This reduction was driven by a lower tax rate of 21% in 2018 compared to 35% in 2017 as well as fewer principal payments remaining, partially offset by an increase in invested RC facilities in which Tinuum Group recognized as installment sales for tax purposes from 17 as of December 31, 2017 to 19 as of December 31, 2018.\nThe following table shows the balance of the tax liability that has been deferred and the applicable interest rate to calculate 453A interest:\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax liability deferred on installment sales (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Represents the approximate tax effected liability utilizing the federal tax rate in effect for the applicable years ended related to the deferred gain on installment sales (approximately $170 million as of December 31, 2018).\nBased on the interest rate in effect as of the date of this filing, the 453A interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 is expected to be 6%.\nOffsetting the decrease in 453A interest expense was an increase due to $0.5 million in interest related to the Senior Term Loan entered into on December 7, 2018 to fund the Carbon Solutions Acquisition.\nOther\nThe components of Other income (expense) include the following significant items:\nIndemnity Settlement Agreement\nIn December 2017, prior to the Carbon Solutions Acquisition, we, Carbon Solutions and the former parent company of Carbon Solutions agreed to terminate certain provisions of the Indemnity Settlement Agreement (the \" Indemnity Termination Agreement\"). Pursuant to an agreement executed concurrently with the Indemnity Termination Agreement, the Company, Norit International B.V. and one of its an affiliates (collectively referred to as Norit\u201d) agreed to a final payment in the amount of $3.3 million (the \"Settlement Payment\") to settle all outstanding royalty obligations (the \"Royalty Award\") owed under the terms of a settlement agreement executed in 2011 between the Company and Norit. We paid this amount on December 29, 2017.\nUnder the Indemnity Termination Agreement, and upon payment of the Settlement Payment, we were relieved of certain financial and indemnity obligations required by the terms of the settlement agreement with Norit, including the obligation to maintain LC's securing future royalty payment obligations. As of December 31, 2017, $3.5 million in LC's related to the Royalty Award were outstanding, but were canceled by all parties in January 2018, pursuant to the Indemnity Termination Agreement.\nSettlement with service provider\nIn November 2017, we entered into a settlement agreement with a former third-party service provider and as part of the settlement we received cash in the amount of $3.5 million. Cash from this settlement was received in December 2017.\nAdvanced Emission Solutions, Inc. Profit Sharing Retirement Plan\nIn 2016, the DOL opened an investigation into the Advanced Emissions Solutions, Inc. Profit Sharing Retirement Plan (the 401(k) Plan\u201d), and we, as Plan Sponsor, cooperated with that investigation. In February 2018, as part of ongoing discussions, we and the DOL came to an agreement whereby we would make a restorative payment to the 401(k) Plan in the amount of $1.0 million as an estimate of lost earnings for 401(k) Plan participants as of January 1, 2015. Thereafter, the DOL would close the investigation with no further action against the 401(k) Plan or its fiduciaries, including any further investigation. We determined this contingency to be both probable and reasonably estimable and accrued $1.0 million as of December 31, 2017. The liability was recorded in the Other current liabilities line item on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The expense recognized related to this accrual was included in the Other line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. We made a payment of $1.0 million to the 401(k) Plan on June 1, 2018 and no liability existed as of December 31, 2018. On September 7, 2018, we received notification that the DOL had closed its investigation and no further action is required by us.\nImpairment of cost method investment\nIn November 2014, we acquired an 8% ownership interest in the common stock of Highview (\"Highview\"), a London, England based development stage company specializing in power storage. We accounted for our investment in Highview (the \"Highview Investment\") in accordance with U.S. GAAP applicable to equity investments that do not qualify for the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 2017, we recorded an impairment charge of $0.5 million for the Highview Investment based on an estimated fair value of \u00a31.00 per share compared to the estimated carrying value prior to the impairment charge of \u00a32.00 per share. The impairment charge was included in the Other line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nIncome tax expense\nOn December 22, 2017 (the \"Enactment Date\"), the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"). The Tax Act made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code and key provisions applicable to the Company, or certain of Tinuum Group's existing or potential customers, for 2018 included the following: (1) reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent; (2) elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT); (3) a new limitation on deductible interest expense; (4) limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation; (5) limitations on the use of federal tax credits (\"FTCs\") to reduce the U.S. income tax liability; (6) limitations on net operating losses (\"NOL's\") generated after December 31, 2017, to 80 percent of taxable income; and the introduction of the Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax ( BEAT\u201d) for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017.\nAs a result of the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, we recorded an adjustment to our recorded deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of the Enactment Date for those temporary differences expected to reverse after the Enactment Date. During 2018, we did not make any accounting adjustments related to the Tax Act.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, our reported income tax expense of $10.4 million differed from income tax expense computed by applying the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate (the \"Federal Rate\") of $9.6 million primarily due to a reduction in income tax expense from tax credits realized of $7.0 million, offset by increases in income tax expense from state income tax expense, net of federal benefit of $3.6 million and an increase in the valuation adjustment on our deferred tax assets of $4.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our reported income tax expense of $24.2 million differed from income tax expense computed using the Federal Rate of $18.2 million primarily due to increases in income tax expense from state income tax expense, net of federal benefit of $1.7 million and from a reduction in our net deferred tax assets of $5.8 million from the change in federal tax rates from 35% to 21%, offset by a decrease in income tax expense from tax credits realized of $1.9 million.\nAccounting for income taxes requires that companies assess whether a valuation allowance should be recorded against their deferred tax asset based on an assessment of the amount of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not\u201d to be realized. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nWe assess the valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets at each reporting date. The determination of whether a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is appropriate requires the evaluation of positive and negative evidence that can be objectively verified. Consideration must be given to all sources of taxable income available to realize the deferred tax asset, including, as applicable, the future reversal of existing temporary differences, future taxable income forecasts exclusive of the reversal of temporary differences and carryforwards, taxable income in carryback years and tax planning strategies. In estimating taxes, we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions taking into account statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we concluded it is more likely than not we will generate sufficient taxable income within the applicable NOL and tax credit carry-forward periods to realize $32.5 million of our net deferred tax assets, and therefore, reversed $4.5 million of the valuation allowance. In reaching this conclusion, we most significantly considered: (1) forecasts of continued future taxable income and (2) impacts of additional RC invested facilities during 2018. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had a valuation allowance recorded of $79.9 million and $75.4 million, respectively, against our deferred tax assets.\nDuring 2019, due to the impact of Tinuum Group selling an additional RC facility during the three months ended March 31, 2019, as well as the impacts of Tinuum Group's adoption of ASU 2014-09 and ASU 2016-02, we expect that we will record an adjustment to our valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets.\nThe ability to recognize the remaining deferred tax assets that continue to be subject to a valuation allowance is evaluated on a quarterly basis to determine if there are any significant events that would affect the ability to utilize those deferred tax assets.\nOur estimate of future taxable income is based on internal projections that consider historical performance, multiple internal scenarios and assumptions, as well as external data that we believe is reasonable. If events are identified that affect our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, or if additional deferred tax assets are generated, the analysis will be updated to determine if any\nadjustments to the valuation allowance are required. If actual results differ negatively from the current estimates of future taxable income, even if caused by adverse macro-economic conditions, the remaining valuation allowance may need to be increased. Such an increase could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Conversely, better than expected results and continued positive results and trends could result in further releases to the deferred tax valuation allowance, and any such decreases could have a material positive effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSee additional discussion in Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nBusiness Segments\nAs of December 31, 2018, we have two reportable segments: (1) Refined Coal (\"RC'); and (2) Power Generation and Industrials (\"PGI\") (f/k/a \"Emissions Control\").\nThe business segment measurements provided to and evaluated by our chief operating decision maker are computed in accordance with the principles listed below:\n \u2022 The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies except as described below. \n \u2022 Segment revenues include equity method earnings and losses from our equity method investments. \n \u2022 Segment operating income (loss) includes segment revenues, gains related to sales of equity method investments and allocation of certain \"Corporate general and administrative expenses,\" which include Payroll and benefits, Rent and occupancy, Legal and professional fees, and General and administrative. \n \u2022 RC segment operating income includes interest expense directly attributable to the RC segment.  The principal products and services of our segments are:\n 1. RC - Our RC segment derives its earnings from equity method investments as well as royalty payment streams and other revenues related to enhanced combustion of and reduced emissions of both NOX and mercury from the burning of RC. Our equity method investments related to the RC segment include Tinuum Group, Tinuum Services as well as other immaterial equity method investments. Segment revenues include equity method earnings (losses) from our equity method investments and royalty earnings from Tinuum Group. These earnings are included within the Earnings from equity method investments and License royalties, related party line items in the Consolidated Statements of Operations included in Item 8 of this Report. Key drivers to RC segment performance are the produced and sold RC from both operating and retained RC facilities, royalty-bearing tonnage, and the number of operating (leased or sold) and retained RC facilities. These key drivers impact our earnings and cash distributions from equity method investments. \n 2. PGI - Our PGI segment includes revenues and related expenses from the sale of consumable products that utilize PAC and chemical technologies as well as historically the sale of ACI and DSI equipment systems. These options provide coal-powered utilities and industrial boilers with mercury control solutions working in conjunction with ACI and DSI systems and other pollution control equipment, generally without the requirement for significant ongoing capital outlays. These amounts are included within the respective revenue and cost of revenue line items in the Consolidated Statements of Operations included in Item 8 of this Report. \nThe following table presents our operating segment results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Refined Coal:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings in equity method investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>365\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Royalties, related party\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Power Generation and Industrials:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equipment sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31,374\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumables\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26,992\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total segment reporting revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,159\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments to reconcile to reported revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings in equity method investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(54,208\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(53,843\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(365\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total reported revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(21,419\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Refined Coal (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65,454\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Power Generation and Industrials (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,621\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total segment operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Included within the RC segment operating income for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is 453A interest expense of $1.6 million and $2.6 million, respectively. Also included within the RC segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $0.4 million of severance expense.\n(2) Included within the PGI segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately $1.0 million of amortization related to a step up in basis of the fair value of inventory. Also included within the PGI segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $1.0 million of severance expense.\nA reconciliation of segment operating income to consolidated net income is included in Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nRC\nThe following table details the segment revenues of our respective equity method investments for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from Tinuum Group\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from Tinuum Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from equity method investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRC earnings increased primarily due to increased equity earnings from Tinuum Services during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, as presented above. Our equity earnings increased primarily due to an increase in Tinuum Services' earnings as a result of the addition of two invested facilities. Cash distributions decreased year over year as a result of incurred costs related to the engineering and installation phases of RC facilities, which have reduced distributions to Tinuum Group's equity members even though Tinuum Group did obtain two additional invested facilities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Tinuum Group's consolidated earnings increased $26.0 million from the comparable December 31, 2017 period due to an increase in lease revenues driven by increased sales of facilities to third-party investors.\nAs discussed above and in Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report, our earnings in Tinuum Group may not equal our pro-rata share due to the accounting related to our equity method investment.\nRC operating income in 2018 was also positively impacted for the following:\n \u2022 An increase in earnings from Tinuum Services, which was primarily due to an increase in the number of RC facilities operated by Tinuum Services during 2018; \n \u2022 An increase in M-45 royalties earned as a result of increased tonnage; and \n \u2022 A decrease in 453A interest expense as a result of the decreased federal tax rate and the declining deferred tax liability.  PGI\nPGI segment operating income decreased during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to a decrease in revenues year over year, as discussed within the consolidated results. The decrease in PGI segment operating income was driven by a decrease in Equipment sales revenue, less equipment sales cost of revenue, as no further revenue from equipment sales is expected. Additionally, PGI operating income was positively impacted by incremental Carbon Solutions revenues of $5.6 million, offset by cost of revenues of $3.4 million, inclusive of $1.0 million related to the amortization of a step up in basis of acquired finished goods inventory related to Carbon Solutions Acquisition. The decrease in operating income is also due to an increase in restructuring expense of $0.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview of Factors Affecting Our Liquidity\nDuring 2018, our liquidity position was positively affected primarily from distributions from Tinuum Group and Tinuum Services, royalty payments from Tinuum Group and borrowing availability under our bank (\"Lender\") line of credit (the \"Line of Credit\").\nOur principal sources of liquidity currently include:\n \u2022 cash and cash equivalents on hand; \n \u2022 distributions from Tinuum Group and Tinuum Services; \n \u2022 royalty payments from Tinuum Group; \n \u2022 the Line of Credit; and \n \u2022 operations in the PGI segment.  Our principal uses of liquidity during the year ended December 31, 2018 included:\n \u2022 acquisition of Carbon Solutions \n \u2022 payment of dividends; \n \u2022 repurchases of shares of our common stock pursuant to a stock repurchase program by which we may repurchase up to $20.0 million of our outstanding common stock, from time to time; \n \u2022 our business operating expenses, including federal and state tax payments; and \n \u2022 delivering on our existing contracts and customer commitments.  Our ability to continue to generate sufficient cash flow required to meet ongoing operational needs and obligations, as well as future expected dividend payments and potential future share repurchases, depends upon several factors, including executing on our contracts and initiatives, receiving royalty payments from Tinuum Group and distributions from Tinuum Group and Tinuum Services, and increasing our share of the market for PGI consumables as well as expansion of our overall PAC business into additional adjacent markets. Increased distributions from Tinuum Group will likely be dependent upon both preserving existing contractual relationships and the securing of additional tax equity investors for those Tinuum Group facilities that are currently not operating.\nOur use of liquidity for capital expenditures has not been significant for the periods presented. Due to the acquisition of Carbon Solutions, we expect that use of liquidity for capital expenditures will increase in future periods. Carbon Solutions has historically incurred costs for capital expenditures related to the PAC manufacturing facility under normal operations and planned outages and for mine development at the Five Forks. Certain of Carbon Solutions' recent historical planned capital expenditures were delayed due to the sales process. During due diligence and validated upon acquisition, we evaluated capital expenditure needs and anticipate additional material capital resources will be needed to maintain or improve capital assets.\nTinuum Group and Tinuum Services Distributions\nThe following table summarizes the cash distributions from our equity method investments, which most significantly affected our consolidated cash flow results, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tinuum Group\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tinuum Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributions from equity method investees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFuture cash flows from Tinuum through 2021 are expected to range from $200 to $225 million, and key drivers in achieving these future cash flows are based on the following:\n \u2022 19 invested facilities as of December 31, 2018 and inclusive of all net Tinuum cash flows (distributions and license royalties), offset by estimated federal and state income tax payments and 453A interest payments.  Expected future cash flows from Tinuum Group are based on the following key assumptions:\n \u2022 Tinuum Group continues to not operate retained facilities; \n \u2022 Tinuum Group does not have material capital expenditures or unusual operating expenses; \n \u2022 Tax equity lease renewals on invested facilities are not terminated or repriced; and \n \u2022 Coal-fired power generation remains constant.  Future incremental invested RC facilities would positively impact our expectation of future cash flows.\nSenior Term Loan\nOn December 7, 2018, we executed the Senior Term Loan with Apollo in the principal amount of $70.0 million, less original issue discount of $2.1 million. We also paid debt issuance costs of $2.0 million related to the Senior Term Loan. The Senior Term Loan has a term of 36 months and bears interest at a rate equal to 3-month LIBOR (subject to a 1.5% floor) + 4.75% per annum, which is adjusted quarterly to the current 3-month LIBOR rate, and interest is payable quarterly in arrears. Quarterly principal payments of $6.0 million are required beginning in March 2019, and we may prepay the Senior Term Loan at any time without penalty. The Senior Term Loan is secured by substantially all of our assets, including the cash flows from Tinuum Group and Tinuum Services, but excluding our equity interests in those Tinuum entities.\nThe Senior Term Loan includes, among others, the following covenants: (1) Beginning December 31, 2018 and as of the end of each fiscal quarter thereafter, we must maintain a minimum cash balance of $5.0 million and shall not permit \"expected future net cash flows from the refined coal business\" (as defined in the Senior Term Loan) to be less than 1.75 times the outstanding principal amount of the Senior Term Loan; (2) Beginning in January 2019, annual collective dividends and buybacks of shares of our common stock in an aggregate amount, not to exceed $30.0 million, are permitted so long as (a) no default or event of default exists under the Senior Term Loan and (b) expected future net cash flows from the refined coal business as of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter exceed $100.0 million.\nStock Repurchases and Dividends\nIn November 2018, the Board authorized us to purchase up to $20.0 million of our outstanding common stock. This stock repurchase program will remain in effect until December 31, 2019 unless otherwise modified by the Board. Previously, in December 2017, the Board had authorized us to purchase up to $20.0 million of our outstanding common stock under a separate repurchase program that was in effect until July 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2018, under these two stock repurchase programs, we purchased 2,350,422 shares of our common stock for cash of $25.3 million, inclusive of commissions and fees.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we declared and paid quarterly cash dividends to stockholders of $20.2 million, which were paid on March 8, 2018, June 8, 2018, September 6, 2018 and December 6, 2018.\nLine of Credit\nAs of December 31, 2018, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Line of Credit.\nOn September 30, 2018, ADA, as borrower, ADES, as guarantor, and the Lender entered into an amendment (the \"Twelfth Amendment\") to the Line of Credit. The Twelfth Amendment decreased the Line of Credit to $5.0 million due to decreased collateral requirements, extended the maturity date of the Line of Credit to September 30, 2020 and permitted the Line of Credit to be used as collateral (in place of restricted cash) for letters of credit (\"LC's\") up to $5.0 million related to equipment projects and certain other agreements. Under the Twelfth Amendment, there was no minimum cash balance requirement based on us meeting certain conditions and maintaining minimum trailing twelve-month EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), as previously defined in the \"Eleventh Amendment\" to the Line of Credit, of $24.0 million.\nOn December 7, 2018, ADA, as borrower, ADES as guarantor, and the Lender entered into an amendment to the Line of Credit, which provided, among other things, for ADA to be able to enter into the Senior Term Loan as a guarantor so long as the principal amount of the Senior Term Loan does not exceed $70 million. Additionally, the financial covenants in the Line of Credit were amended and restated to be consistent with the aforementioned Senior Term Loan covenants, including maintaining a minimum cash balance of $5.0 million.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased from $30.7 million as of December 31, 2017 to $23.8 million as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $6.9 million. The following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively: Table 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,889\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11,748\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,543\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(64,929\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32,889\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,921\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,670\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash flows from operating activities\nCash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $1.9 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 and were positively impacted primarily by the following: (1) an increase in net income of $7.6 million; (2) a change in Legal settlements and accruals due to settlement of obligation results in cash outflow of $16.1 million in 2017; and (3) an increase in Distributions from equity method investees, return on investment of $0.9 million. Offsetting these increases to operating cash flows were primarily the following: (1) a decrease of $17.5 million due to the change in deferred tax assets as a result of utilization to offset taxable income in 2017 and changes to the valuation allowance in 2018; and (2) a net increase in working capital and other liabilities of $4.6 million, primarily due to an increase in receivables from Tinuum Group related to revenues from license royalties and an increase in receivables from customers as a result of the addition of new customers from the Carbons Solutions Acquisition.\nCash flows from investing activities\nDistributions from equity method investees\nOur cash flows from investing activities are significantly impacted by cash distributions from equity method investees that represent a return in excess of cumulative earnings, which decreased from $48.9 million in 2017 to $47.2 million in 2018. All of these cash distributions were received from Tinuum Group.\nAcquisition of business, net of cash acquired\nThe Carbon Solutions Acquisition completed in 2018 resulted in total cash consideration paid of $65.8 million less cash acquired of $3.3 million. In addition, the total purchase consideration included $0.7 million payable to Carbon Solutions' previous debt holder, which was paid in March 2019. Also as part of the Carbon Solutions Acquisition, we also assumed capital leases and other contractual commitments of $11.8 million.\nPurchase of and contribution to equity method investee\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018 we made a contribution to Tinuum Services of $0.8 million due to a capital call.\nCash flows from financing activities\nBorrowings on long-term debt, related party and debt issuance costs paid\nWe funded the Carbon Solutions Acquisition through cash on hand and the proceeds of the Senior Term Loan in"}
