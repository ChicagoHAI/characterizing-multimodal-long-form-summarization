Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake or assume any obligation to update publicly any of these statements to reflect actual results, new information or future events, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking statements, except to the extent required by applicable laws.

As of December 31, 2015, we had consolidated assets of $8.7 billion, deposits of $7.1 billion, loans of $5.2 billion and total stockholders' equity of $950 million.\nWe currently operate 79 banking offices, including detached drive-up facilities, in 45 communities located in Montana, Wyoming and South Dakota. We also offer internet and mobile banking services. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, FIB, we deliver a comprehensive range of banking products and services to individuals, businesses, municipalities and other entities throughout our market areas. Our customers participate in a wide variety of industries, including energy, healthcare and professional services, education and governmental services, construction, mining, agriculture, retail and wholesale trade and tourism.\nOur Business\nOur principal business activity is lending to, accepting deposits from and conducting financial transactions for individuals, businesses, municipalities and other entities. We derive our income principally from interest charged on loans and, to a lesser extent, from interest and dividends earned on investments. We also derive income from non-interest sources such as fees received in connection with various lending and deposit services; trust, employee benefit, investment and insurance services; mortgage loan originations, sales and servicing; merchant and electronic banking services; and from time to time, gains on sales of assets. Our principal expenses include interest expense on deposits and borrowings, operating expenses, provisions for loan losses and income tax expense.\nOur loan portfolio consists of a mix of real estate, consumer, commercial, agricultural and other loans, including fixed and variable rate loans. Our real estate loans comprise commercial real estate, construction (including residential, commercial and land development loans), residential, agricultural and other real estate loans. Fluctuations in the loan portfolio are directly related to the economies of the communities we serve. While each loan originated generally must meet minimum underwriting standards established in our credit policies, lending officers are granted discretion within pre-approved limits in approving and pricing loans to assure that the banking offices are responsive to competitive issues and community needs in each market area. We fund our loan portfolio primarily with the core deposits from our customers, generally without utilizing brokered deposits and with minimal reliance on wholesale funding sources. For additional information about our underwriting standards and loan approval process, see \"Business-Lending Activities,\" included in Part I, Item 1 of this report.\nRecent Trends and Developments\nOn July 24, 2015, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Absarokee Bancorporation, Inc., or Absarokee, a Montana-based bank holding company operating one wholly-owned subsidiary bank, United Bank, with branches located in three Montana communities adjacent to the Company's existing market areas. United Bank was merged with FIB immediately subsequent to the acquisition. We paid cash consideration for the acquisition of $7.2 million. As of the acquisition date, Absarokee had total assets of $75 million, loans of $37 million and deposits of $64 million. For additional information regarding the acquisition, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Acquisition,\u201d included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nOn July 2, 2013, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank issued a final rule implementing a revised regulatory capital framework for U.S. banks in accordance with the Basel III international accord. The revised regulatory capital framework, or Basel III, became effective for us on January 1, 2015. Basel III includes a more stringent definition of capital and introduces a new common equity tier 1, or CET1, capital requirement, sets forth a comprehensive methodology for calculating risk-weighted assets, introduces a conservation buffer and sets out minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards. Certain deductions and adjustments to regulatory capital phase in starting January 1, 2015 and will be fully implemented on January 1, 2018. The capital conservation buffer phases in beginning January 1, 2016 and will be fully\nimplemented on January 1, 2019. As of December 31, 2015, we had capital levels that, in all cases, exceeded the well-capitalized guidelines. For additional information regarding our capital levels, see \"Capital Resources and Liquidity Management\" included herein and Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements-Regulatory Capital,\u201d included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nPrimary Factors Used in Evaluating Our Business\nAs a banking institution, we manage and evaluate various aspects of both our financial condition and our results of operations. We monitor our financial condition and performance and evaluate the levels and trends of the line items included in our balance sheet and statements of income, as well as various financial ratios that are commonly used in our industry. We analyze these ratios and financial trends against both our own historical levels and the financial condition and performance of comparable banking institutions in our region and nationally.\nResults of Operations\nPrincipal factors used in managing and evaluating our results of operations include return on average assets, net interest income, non-interest income, non-interest expense and net income. Net interest income is affected by the level of interest rates, changes in interest rates and changes in the volume and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. The most significant impact on our net interest income between periods is derived from the interaction of changes in the rates earned or paid on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, which we refer to as interest rate spread. The volume of loans, investment securities and other interest earning assets, compared to the volume of interest bearing deposits and indebtedness, combined with the interest rate spread, produces changes in our net interest income between periods. Non-interest bearing sources of funds, such as demand deposits and stockholders' equity, also support earning assets.\nThe impact of free funding sources is captured in the net interest margin, which is calculated as net interest income divided by average earning assets. We evaluate our net interest income on factors that include the yields on our loans and other earning assets, the costs of our deposits and other funding sources, the levels of our net interest spread and net interest margin.\nWe seek to increase our non-interest income over time and we evaluate our non-interest income relative to the trends of the individual types of non-interest income in view of prevailing market conditions.\nWe manage our non-interest expenses in consideration of growth opportunities and our community banking model that emphasizes customer service and responsiveness. We evaluate our non-interest expense on factors that include our non-interest expense relative to our average assets, our efficiency ratio and the trends of the individual categories of non-interest expense.\nFinally, we seek to increase our net income and provide favorable shareholder returns over time, and we evaluate our net income relative to the performance of other bank holding companies on factors that include return on average assets, return on average equity, total shareholder return and growth in earnings.\nFinancial Condition\nPrincipal areas of focus in managing and evaluating our financial condition include liquidity, the diversification and quality of our loans, the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, the diversification and terms of our deposits and other funding sources, the re-pricing characteristics and maturities of our assets and liabilities, including potential interest rate exposure and the adequacy of our capital levels. We seek to maintain sufficient levels of cash and investment securities to meet potential payment and funding obligations, and we evaluate our liquidity on factors that include the levels of cash and highly liquid assets relative to our liabilities, the quality and maturities of our investment securities, the ratio of loans to deposits and any reliance on brokered certificates of deposit or other wholesale funding sources.\nWe seek to maintain a diverse and high quality loan portfolio and evaluate our asset quality on factors that include the allocation of our loans among loan types, credit exposure to any single borrower or industry type, non-performing assets as a percentage of total loans and OREO, and loan charge-offs as a percentage of average loans. We seek to maintain our allowance for loan losses at a level adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio at each balance sheet date, and we evaluate the level of our allowance for loan losses relative to our overall loan portfolio and the level of non-performing loans and potential charge-offs.\nWe seek to fund our assets primarily using core customer deposits spread among various deposit categories, and we evaluate our deposit and funding mix on factors that include the allocation of our deposits among deposit types, the level of our non-interest bearing deposits, the ratio of our core deposits (i.e. excluding time deposits above $100,000) to our total deposits and our reliance on brokered deposits or other wholesale funding sources, such as borrowings from other banks or agencies. We seek to manage the mix, maturities and re-pricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities to maintain relative stability of our net interest rate margin in a changing interest rate environment, and we evaluate our asset-liability management using models to evaluate the changes to our net interest income under different interest rate scenarios.\nFinally, we seek to maintain adequate capital levels to absorb unforeseen operating losses and to help support the growth of our balance sheet. We evaluate our capital adequacy using the regulatory and financial capital ratios including leverage capital ratio, tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, total risk-based capital ratio, tangible common equity to tangible assets and tier 1 common capital to total risk-weighted assets.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and follow general practices within the industries in which we operate. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d included in financial statements included Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nOur critical accounting estimates are summarized below. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) the accounting estimate requires management to make particularly difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and (2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or the use of different estimates that management could have reasonably used in the current period, would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, results of operations or liquidity.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses creates an allowance for loan losses known and inherent in the loan portfolio at each balance sheet date. The allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio.\nWe perform a quarterly assessment of the risks inherent in our loan portfolio, as well as a detailed review of each significant loan with identified weaknesses. Based on this analysis, we record a provision for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at appropriate levels. In determining the allowance for loan losses, we estimate losses on specific loans, or groups of loans, where the probable loss can be identified and reasonably determined. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of subjective measurements, including management's assessment of the internal risk classifications of loans, historical loan loss rates, changes in the nature of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality, industry concentrations, delinquency trends and the impact of current local, regional and national economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio. Changes in these estimates and assumptions are possible and may have a material impact on our allowance, and therefore our consolidated financial statements or results of operations. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at an amount we believe is sufficient to provide for estimated losses inherent in our loan portfolio at each balance sheet date, and fluctuations in the provision for loan losses result from management's assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Management monitors qualitative and quantitative trends in the loan portfolio, including changes in the levels of past due, internally classified and non-performing loans. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d for a description of the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses. A discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included herein under the heading -Financial Condition-Allowance for Loan Losses.\u201d See also Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors-Risks Relating to the Market and Our Business.\u201d\nGoodwill\nThe excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets from acquisitions, or goodwill, is evaluated for impairment at least annually and on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is likely impairment has occurred. In any given year, the Company may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is in excess of its carrying value. If it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of the carrying value, or if the Company elects to bypass the qualitative assessment, a two-step quantitative impairment test is performed. In performing a quantitative test for impairment, the fair value of net assets is estimated based on an analysis of our market value, discounted cash flows and peer values. Determining the fair value of goodwill is considered a critical accounting estimate because of its sensitivity to market-based economics. In addition, any allocation of the fair value of goodwill to assets and liabilities requires significant management judgment and the use of subjective measurements. Variability in market conditions and key assumptions or subjective measurements used to estimate and allocate fair value are reasonably possible and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations.\nOur annual goodwill impairment test is performed each year as of July 1st. Upon completion of this year's test, the estimated fair value of net assets was greater than carrying value of the Company. We will continue to monitor our performance and evaluate our goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently as needed.\nFor additional information regarding goodwill, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report and Risk Factors-Risks Relating to the Market and Our Business,\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\nFair Values of Loans Acquired in Business Combinations\nLoans acquired in business combinations are initially recorded at fair value with no carryover of the related allowance for credit losses. Determining the fair value of the loans involves estimating the amount and timing of principal and interest cash flows initially expected to be collected on the loans and discounting those cash flows at an appropriate market rate of interest. Going forward, the Company continues to evaluate reasonableness of expectations for the timing and the amount of cash to be collected. Subsequent decreases in expected cash flows may result in changes in the amortization or accretion of fair market value adjustments, and in some cases may result in the loan being considered impaired. For collateral dependent loans with deteriorated credit quality, the Company estimates the fair value of the underlying collateral of the loans. These values are discounted using market derived rates of return, with consideration given to the period of time and costs associated with the foreclosure and disposition of the collateral.\nFor additional information regarding acquired loans, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Acquisitions\u201d and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Loans,\u201d included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion of our results of operations compares the years ended December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2014 and the years ended December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2013.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income, the largest source of our operating income, is derived from interest, dividends and fees received on interest earning assets, less interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities. Interest earning assets primarily include loans and investment securities. Interest bearing liabilities include deposits and various forms of indebtedness. Net interest income is affected by the level of interest rates, changes in interest rates and changes in the composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities.\nThe most significant impact on our net interest income between periods is derived from the interaction of changes in the volume of and rates earned or paid on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. The volume of loans, investment\nsecurities and other interest earning assets, compared to the volume of interest bearing deposits and indebtedness, combined with the interest rate spread, produces changes in the net interest income between periods.\nThe following table presents, for the periods indicated, condensed average balance sheet information, together with interest income and yields earned on average interest earning assets and interest expense and rates paid on average interest bearing liabilities.\nAverage Balance Sheets, Yields and Rates\n(Dollars in thousands)\nTable 93:

Our FTE net interest income increased $15.9 million, or 6.3%, to $268.7 million in 2015, compared to $252.8 million in 2014. Interest accretion related to the fair valuation of acquired loans contributed $5.4 million of interest income during 2015, $1.5 million of which was the result of early loan pay-offs. Net FTE interest income was also positively impacted by recoveries of previously charged-off interest of $2.1 million in 2015, as compared to $3.6 million in 2014. Despite increases in our net FTE interest income, our net interest margin ratio decreased 3 basis points to 3.46% in 2015, compared to 3.49% in 2014. Declines in yields earned on the Company's loan and investment portfolios were partially offset by increases in average interest earning assets, primarily loans and investment securities, and reductions in funding costs. Exclusive of the accelerated interest accretion related to early payoffs of acquired loans and the impact of recoveries of charged-off interest, our net interest margin ratio was 3.40% during 2015 and 3.43% during 2014.\nDuring 2014, our FTE net interest income increased $11.3 million, or 4.7%, to $252.8 million in 2014, compared to $241.5 million in 2013, primarily due to deposit growth combined with corresponding increases in interest earning assets and a 5 basis point reduction in our funding costs. Interest accretion related to the fair valuation of acquired loans contributed $2.6 million of interest income during 2014, $1.0 million of which was the result of early loan pay-offs. Net FTE interest income was also positively impacted by recoveries of previously charged-off interest of $3.6 million in 2014, as compared to $1.4 million in 2013. Despite increases in our net FTE interest income, our net interest margin ratio decreased 5 basis points to 3.49% in 2014, compared to 3.54% in 2013. Declines in yields earned on the Company's loan and investment portfolios were partially offset by increases in average outstanding loans and reductions in funding costs.

for tax exempt loans and securities are presented on a FTE basis.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses supports the allowance for loan losses known and inherent in the loan portfolio at each balance sheet date. We perform a quarterly assessment of the risks inherent in our loan portfolio, as well as a detailed review of each significant loan with identified weaknesses. Based on this analysis, we record a provision for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at appropriate levels. In determining the allowance for loan losses, we estimate losses on specific loans, or groups of loans, where the probable loss can be identified and reasonably determined. The balance of the allowance for loan losses is based on internally assigned risk classifications of loans, historical loan loss rates, changes in the nature of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality, industry concentrations, delinquency trends, current economic factors and the estimated impact of current economic conditions on certain historical loan loss rates. Fluctuations in the provision for loan losses result from management's assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Ultimate loan losses may vary from current estimates. For additional information concerning the provision for loan losses, see -Critical Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies\u201d included herein.\nFluctuations in the provision for loan losses reflect management's estimate of possible loan losses based upon evaluation of the borrowers' ability to repay, collateral value underlying loans, loan loss trends and estimated effects of current economic conditions on our loan portfolio. During 2015, we recorded a provision for loan losses of $6.8 million, as compared to a reversal of provision for loan losses of $6.6 million in 2014. The provision for loan losses recorded in 2015 was attributable to increases in specific reserves on impaired loans and loan growth.\nDuring 2014, reductions in specific reserves on impaired loans and lower general reserves reflective of continued improvement in economic conditions in our market areas, combined with improvement in loss history trends used to estimate required reserves and decreases in the level of criticized real estate and construction loans, which typically require higher reserves based on loss history, resulted in a $6.6 million reversal of provision for loan losses. During 2013, declining levels of non-performing assets and criticized loans indicative of improvement in and stabilization of our credit quality, combined with our assessment of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses resulted in a reversal of provision for loan losses of $6.1 million. For additional information concerning non-performing assets, see -Financial Condition-Non-Performing Assets\u201d herein.\nNon-interest Income\nOur principal sources of non-interest income include other service charges, commissions and fees; income from the origination and sale of loans; wealth management revenues; and, service charges on deposit accounts. Non-interest income increased $9.5 million, or 8.6%, to $120.9 million in 2015 as compared to $111.4 million in 2014, and decreased $278 thousand, or less than 1.0%, to $111.4 million in 2014, as compared to $111.7 million in 2013. Significant components of these fluctuations are discussed below.\nOther service charges, commissions and fees primarily include debit and credit card interchange income, mortgage servicing fees, insurance and other commissions and ATM service charge revenues. Other service charges, commissions and fees increased $2.4 million, or 5.9%, to $43.2 million in 2015 as compared to $40.7 million in 2014, and increased $4.8 million, or 13.2%, to $40.7 million in 2014 as compared to $36.0 million in 2013, primarily due to increases in interchange revenue due to higher credit and debit card transaction volumes and increases in mortgage loan servicing fee income resulting from an increase in the number of loans serviced.\nIncome from the origination and sale of loans includes origination and processing fees on residential real estate loans held for sale and gains on residential real estate loans sold to third parties. Fluctuations in market interest rates have a significant impact on revenues generated from the origination and sale of loans. Higher interest rates can reduce the demand for home loans and loans to refinance existing mortgages. Conversely, lower interest rates generally stimulate refinancing and home loan origination. Income from the origination and sale of loans increased $6.0 million, or 25.2%, to $30.0 million during 2015, as compared to $23.9 million during 2014. Our mortgage loan production volume increased 25% during 2015, as compared to 2014. Loans originated for home purchases accounted for approximately 66% of our 2015 production, as compared to 75% in 2014 and 54% in 2013.\nIncome from the origination and sale of loans decreased $10.3 million, or 30.1%, to $23.9 million during 2014, as compared to $34.3 million during 2013, due to the combined impacts of lower demand for refinancing loans in our market areas and increased retention of select mortgage loan production in our residential real estate loan portfolio.\nWealth management revenues are principally comprised of fees earned for management of trust assets and investment services revenues. Wealth management revenues increased $911 thousand, or 4.8%, to $19.9 million in 2015, as compared to $19.0 million in 2014, and increased $1.9 million, or 11.2%, to $19.0 million in 2014, as compared to $17.1 million in 2013, primarily due to the addition of new wealth management customers and increases in the market values of new and existing assets under management.\nOther income primarily includes company-owned life insurance revenues, net gains or losses on securities held under deferred compensation plans, check printing income, agency stock dividends and gains on sales of miscellaneous assets. Other income decreased $368 thousand, or 3.3%, to $10.7 million in 2015, as compared to $11.1 million in 2014. During 2015, other income included a one-time gain of $863 thousand on the sale of land and the reversal of a $1.0 million expense accrual due to final settlement of secondary investor claims assumed as part of the Mountain West Financial Corp., or MWFC, acquisition. In addition, income from life insurance policies increased $571 thousand in 2015, as compared to 2014. When comparing 2015 to 2014, increases in other income in 2015 were more than offset by significant one-time other income items recorded in 2014. During 2014, other income included one-time net gains of $1.2 million related to the sale of two FIB bank buildings and insurance death benefits of $921 thousand. Also contributing to the decrease in other income in 2015, as compared to 2014, were decreases of $1.0 million in earnings on securities held under deferred compensation plans.\nOther income increased $3.6 million, or 47.4%, to $11.1 million in 2014, as compared to $7.5 million in 2013. Income from life insurance increased $2.2 million in 2014, as compared to 2013, due to a full year of earnings on $60.0 million of life insurance purchased in December 2013 and January 2014, additional earnings on $13 million of company-owned life insurance acquired in the MWFC acquisition and the receipt of death benefits of $921. In addition, during fourth quarter 2014, we recorded net gains of $1.2 million related to the sale of two FIB bank buildings and received a $616 thousand volume bonus from our card payment network. These increases in other income in 2014, as compared to 2013, were partially offset by a decrease of $911 thousand in earnings on securities held under deferred compensation plans.\nNon-interest Expense\nNon-interest expense increased $11.1 million, or 4.7%, to $248.0 million in 2015, as compared to $236.9 million in 2014, and increased $14.8 million, or 6.7%, to $236.9 million in 2014, from $222.1 million in 2013. Non-interest expense for 2015 and 2014 includes $5.8 million and $8.0 million, respectively, of acquisition and loss contingency expenses. Exclusive of these acquisition and loss contingency expenses, non-interest expense increased $13.3 million, or 5.8%, to $242.2 million in 2015 as compared to $228.9 million 2014, and increased $6.8 million, or 3.1%, to $228.9 million in 2014, as compared to $222.1 in 2013. Significant components of these increases are discussed in more detail below.\nSalaries and wages increased $4.9 million, or 5.1%, to $101.5 million in 2015, from $96.5 million in 2014, primarily due to increased personnel costs associated with the MWFC acquisition in July 2014 and the Absarokee acquisition in July 2015, inflationary wage increases and higher commissions paid to mortgage loan originators due to higher loan production volumes. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $1.5 million in incentive bonus accruals reflective of our 2015 performance against our 2015 performance targets.\nSalaries and wages increased $2.5 million, or 2.7%, to $96.5 million in 2014, from $94.0 million in 2013, primarily due to increased personnel costs associated with the MWFC acquisition and inflationary wage increases. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $2.8 million in incentive bonus accruals reflective of the addition of new performance metrics and changes in the weighting of metrics used in determining incentives payable under our short-term incentive program.\nEmployee benefits increased $608 thousand, or 2.0%, to $30.7 million in 2015, as compared to $30.1 million in 2014, primarily due to the increases in group health insurance expense reflective of higher claims experience in 2015 and increased benefits costs resulting from the MWFC acquisition in July 2014 and the Absarokee acquisition in July 2015. These increases were partially offset by lower earnings on securities held under deferred compensation plans. Employee benefits decreased $208 thousand, or less than 1.0%, to $30.1 million in 2014, as compared to $30.3 million in 2013, primarily due to lower earnings on securities held under deferred compensation plans, which were partially offset by higher payroll taxes.\nFurniture and equipment expense increased $1.7 million, or 12.4%, to $15.5 million in 2015, as compared to $13.8 million in 2014, primarily due to costs associated with the implementation of new software systems placed into service during the last half of 2014, the continued upgrade of systems during 2015 and increased maintenance costs resulting from the MWFC acquisition in July 2014 and the Absarokee acquisition in July 2015. Furniture and equipment expense increased $1.3 million, or 10.1%, to $13.8 million in 2014, as compared to $12.6 million in 2013, primarily due to the addition of facilities in conjunction with the acquisition of MWFC and additional software costs associated with the implementation of new systems to assist in accounting for acquired loans, processing mortgage loans and automating certain reconciliation functions.\nOREO expense is recorded net of OREO income. Variations in net OREO expense between periods are primarily due to fluctuations in write-downs of the estimated fair value of properties, net gains and losses recorded on the sale of properties and carrying costs and/or operating expenses and income. Net OREO income increased $1.2 million, or 442.3%, to $1.5 million in 2015, as compared to $272 thousand in 2014, primarily due to higher net gains recorded on the sale of properties. During 2015, we recorded net gains of $3.0 million, as compared to net gains of $1.8 million in 2014.\nDuring 2014, we recorded net OREO income of $272 thousand, as compared to net OREO expense of $2.3 million in 2013. During 2014, we recorded gains on the sale of properties of $1.8 million, wrote-down the fair value of properties by $224 thousand and recorded net operating expenses of $1.4 million. This compares to net gains of $3.2 million, write-downs of $3.5 million and net operating expenses of $2.0 million in 2013.\nProfessional fees increased $1.6 million, or 32.3%, to $6.5 million in 2015, as compared to $4.9 million in 2014. During 2015, we incurred professional fees in conjunction with identifying and executing strategies for revenue enhancement and changing our wealth management data platform. Professional fees increased $109 thousand, or 2.3%, to $4.9 million in 2014, as compared to $4.8 million in 2013.\nCore deposit intangibles represent the intangible value of depositor relationships resulting from deposit liabilities assumed and are amortized based on the estimated useful lives of the related deposits. Core deposit intangibles amortization expense increased $1.1 million, or 50.5%, to $3.4 million in 2015, as compared to $2.3 million in 2014 due to additional amortization of core deposit intangibles recorded in conjunction with recent acquisitions. Core deposit intangible assets of $11 million recorded in conjunction with the MWFC acquisition in July 2014 and $695 thousand recorded in conjunction with the Absarokee acquisition in July 2015, are are being amortized using an accelerated method over the estimated useful lives of the related deposits of ten years. Core deposit intangible amortization expense increased $833 thousand, or 58.7%, to $2.3 million during 2014, as compared to $1.4 million during 2013 due to the amortization of core deposit intangible assets associated with the MWFC acquisition.\nOther expenses primarily include advertising and public relations costs; office supply, postage, freight, telephone and travel expenses; donations expense; debit and credit card expenses; board of director fees; legal expenses; and, other losses. Other expenses increased $3.5 million, or 7.3%, to $50.9 million in 2015, as compared to $47.5 million in 2014. During 2015, the Company recorded write-downs aggregating $806 thousand in the fair value of two vacated bank buildings held for sale; recorded a one-time contract termination fee of $876 thousand related to a change in payment service provider; and incurred an additional legal expense of approximately $1.0 million in conjunction with legal settlements reached in 2015. In addition, the Company recorded fraud losses of $1.7 million in 2015, as compared to $1.2 million in 2014, due to unusually high fraudulent credit card activity during the first half of 2015. The remaining increase in other expense in 2015, as compared to 2014, is reflective of additional operating expenses resulting from the MWFC acquisition in July 2014 and the Absarokee acquisition in July 2015. Other expenses increased $4.2 million, or 9.6%, to $47.5 million in 2014, as compared to $43.3 million in 2013, primarily due to additional expenses associated with the acquisition of MWFC.\nDuring 2015 and 2014, we recorded loss contingency expense of $5.0 million and $4.0 million, respectively related to a legal and settlement costs associated with a lender liability lawsuit against FIB. The lawsuit was settled in 2015. For additional information regarding this pending litigation, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nDuring 2015 and 2014, we recorded $795 thousand and $4.0 million of acquisition expenses related to the Absarokee acquisition in July 2015 and MWFC acquisition in July 2014, respectively. Acquisition expenses primarily include legal and professional fees, employee retention payments and travel expenses. For additional information regarding the acquisition, see \"Recent Developments\" included herein and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Acquisitions,\u201d included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur effective federal tax rate was 29.0% for the year ended December 31, 2015, 30.7% for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 30.8% for the year ended December 31, 2013. Decreases in effective federal income tax rates are primarily due to higher levels of federal tax credits resulting from our increased participation in the New Markets Tax Credits Program. For additional information about our participation in the New Markets Tax Credits Program, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nState income tax applies primarily to pretax earnings generated within Montana and South Dakota. Our effective state tax rate was 4.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015, 4.2% for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 4.3% for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nNet Income\nNet income was $86.8 million, or $1.90 per diluted share, in 2015, compared to $84.4 million, or $1.87 per diluted share, in 2014 and $86.1 million, or $1.96 per diluted share, in 2013.\nSummary of Quarterly Results\nThe following table presents unaudited quarterly results of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.

$8,610 million as of December 31, 2014, with $75 million of the increase attributable to the Absarokee acquisition. During 2015, deposit growth combined with proceeds from maturities and paydowns of investment securities were used to fund loan growth. Total assets increased $1,045 million, or 13.8%, to $8,610 as of December 31, 2014, from $7,565 as of December 31, 2013, with approximately $612 million of the increase attributable to the MWFC acquisition. Exclusive of the acquired MWFC assets, total assets increased $433 million, or 5.7%, compared to December 31, 2013, primarily due to organic deposit growth which was used to fund increases in interest earning assets.\nLoans\nOur loan portfolio consists of a mix of real estate, consumer, commercial, agricultural and other loans, including fixed and variable rate loans. Fluctuations in the loan portfolio are directly related to the economies of the communities we serve. While each loan originated generally must meet minimum underwriting standards established in our credit policies, lending officers are granted certain levels of authority in approving and pricing loans to assure that the banking offices are responsive to competitive issues and community needs in each market area. For additional information regarding our underwriting standards and loan approval policies, see \"Community Banking-Lending Activities\", included in Part I, Item I of this report.\nTotal loans increased $349 million, or 7.1%, to $5,246 million as of December 31, 2015, from $4,897 million as of December 31, 2014, with all major categories of loans, except agricultural real estate loans, showing growth. Approximately $37 million of the increase in total loans in 2015, as compared to 2014, was attributable to the Absarokee acquisition. Total loans increased $553 million, or 12.7%, to $4,897 million as of December 31, 2014, from $4,345 million as of December 31, 2013, with approximately $360 million of the increase attributable to the MWFC acquisition. Exclusive of the acquired MWFC loans, total loans increased $193 million, or 4.4%, compared to December 31, 2013, with the most notable organic growth occurring in residential real estate and consumer loans.\nThe following table presents the composition of our loan portfolio as of the dates indicated:\nTable 103: <table><tr><td>Loans Outstanding\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td>

We provide interim construction and permanent financing for both single-family and multi-unit properties, medium-term loans for commercial, agricultural and industrial property and/or buildings and equity lines of credit secured by real estate.\nCommercial real estate loans. Commercial real estate loans include loans for property and improvements used commercially by the borrower or for lease to others for the production of goods or services. Approximately 50% and 51% of our commercial real estate loans were owner occupied as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Commercial real estate loans increased $154 million, or 9.4%, to $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2015, from $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2014, with approximately $12 million of the increase attributable to the Absarokee acquisition. Management attributes the remaining organic growth in commercial real estate loans to continuing business expansion in our market areas and the movement of completed commercial construction projects from construction loans to permanent financing.\nCommercial real estate loans increased $190 million, or 13.1%, to $1,639 million as of December 31, 2014, from $1,449 million as of December 31, 2013. Exclusive of the MWFC acquired loans, commercial real estate loans decreased $25 million, or 1.7%, from December 31, 2013, primarily due to soft loan demand combined with the movement of loans out of the portfolio through charge-off, pay-off and foreclosure.\nConstruction loans. Construction loans are primarily to commercial builders for residential lot development and the construction of single-family residences and commercial real estate properties. Construction loans are generally underwritten pursuant to pre-approved permanent financing. During the construction phase the borrower pays interest only. As of December 31, 2015, our construction loan portfolio was divided among the following categories: approximately $112 million, or 26%, residential construction; approximately $95 million, or 22%, commercial construction; and, approximately $224 million, or 52%, land acquisition and development. This compares to approximately $97 million, or 23%, residential construction; approximately $101 million, or 24%, commercial construction; and, approximately $220 million, or 53%, land acquisition and development as of December 31, 2014.\nConstruction loans grew organically $12 million, or 3.0%, to $431 million as of December 31, 2015, from $418 million as of December 31, 2014. Exclusive of the of the MWFC acquired loans, construction loans increased $37 million, or 10.4%, from December 31, 2013. Management attributes organic growth in construction loans to continuing increased housing demand in our market areas during 2015 and 2014.\nResidential real estate loans. Retained residential real estate loans are typically secured by first liens on the financed property and generally mature in less than fifteen years. Included in residential real estate loans were home equity loans and lines of credit of $299 million as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Residential real estate loans increased $33 million, or 3.3%, to $1,033 million as of December 31, 2015, from $1,000 million as of December 31, 2014, primarily due to continued increased housing demand in our market areas. Residential real estate loans grew $132 million, or 15.2%, to $1,000 million as of December 31, 2014, from $868 million as of December 31, 2013, with approximately $48 million of the increase attributable to the MWFC acquisition. Exclusive of the MWFC acquired loans, residential real estate loans grew $84 million, or 9.6%, from December 31, 2013, due to higher retention of residential loans in our portfolio combined with increased housing demand in our market areas.\nConsumer Loans. Our consumer loans include direct personal loans; credit card loans and lines of credit; and, indirect loans created when we purchase consumer loan contracts advanced for the purchase of automobiles, boats and other consumer goods from the consumer product dealer network within the market areas we serve. Personal loans and indirect dealer loans are generally secured by automobiles, recreational vehicles, boats and other types of personal property and are made on an installment basis. Credit cards are offered to customers in our market areas. Lines of credit are generally floating rate loans that are unsecured or secured by personal property. Approximately 74% and 73% of our consumer loans as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, were indirect consumer loans.\nConsumer loans increased $82 million, or 10.7%, to $844 million as of December 31, 2015, from $762 million as of December 31, 2014, with $70 million of this growth attributable to indirect consumer loans. Consumer loans increased $91 million, or 13.5%, to $762 million as of December 31, 2014, from $672 million as of December 31, 2013, with approximately $9 million of increase attributable to the MWFC acquisition. Exclusive of the MWFC acquisition, consumer loans grew organically $82 million, or 12.2%, from December 31, 2013. Management attributes organic growth in consumer loans to expansion of our indirect lending program within our existing market areas and increases in the average loan amounts advanced in 2015 and 2014.\nCommercial Loans. We provide a mix of variable and fixed rate commercial loans. The loans are typically made to small and medium-sized manufacturing, wholesale, retail and service businesses for working capital needs and business expansions. Commercial loans generally include lines of credit, business credit cards and loans with maturities of five years or less. The loans are generally made with business operations as the primary source of repayment, but also include collateralization by inventory, accounts receivable, equipment and/or personal guarantees.\nCommercial loans increased $52 million, or 7.1%, to $792 million as of December 31, 2015, from $740 million as of December 31, 2014. Commercial loans increased $64 million, or 9.4%, to $740 million as of December 31, 2014, from $677 million as of December 31, 2013, with approximately $48 million of increase attributable to the MWFC acquisition. Exclusive of the MWFC acquisition, commercial loans grew organically $15 million, or 2.2%, from December 31, 2013. Management attributes organic growth in commercial loans to continuing business expansion in certain of our market areas during 2015 and 2014.\nAgricultural Loans. Our agricultural loans generally consist of short and medium-term loans and lines of credit that are primarily used for crops, livestock, equipment and general operations. Agricultural loans are ordinarily secured by assets such as livestock or equipment and are repaid from the operations of the farm or ranch. Agricultural loans generally have maturities of five years or less, with operating lines for one production season. Agricultural loans increased $17 million, or 13.8%, to $142 million as of December 31, 2015, from $125 million as of December 31, 2014, with approximately $7 million of the increase attributable to the Absarokee acquisition. Agricultural loans increased $13 million, or 11.6%, to $125 million as of December 31, 2014, from $112 million as of December 31, 2013, with approximately $2 million of increase attributable to the MWFC acquisition. Exclusive of the acquired loans, agricultural loans increased $11 million, or 10.0%, from December 31, 2013.\nThe following table presents the maturity distribution of our loan portfolio and the sensitivity of the loans to changes in interest rates as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 104: <table><tr><td>Maturities and Interest Rate Sensitivities\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Within\nOne Year\n</td> <td>One Year to\nFive Years\n</td> <td>After\nFive Years\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,072,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,466,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>874,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,413,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer\n</td> <td>247,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>504,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>844,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>396,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>284,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>792,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agricultural\n</td> <td>114,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>142,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>1,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage loans held for sale\n</td> <td>52,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,885,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,281,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,079,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,246,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans at fixed interest rates\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,128,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,459,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>298,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,886,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans at variable interest rates\n</td> <td>757,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>822,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>714,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,293,587\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-accrual loans\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,885,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,281,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,079,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,246,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-Performing Assets\nNon-performing assets include non-performing loans and OREO.

Non-performing loans include non-accrual loans and loans contractually past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest. Impaired loans include all loans risk rated doubtful, loans placed on non-accrual status and loans renegotiated in troubled debt restructurings, with the exception of consumer loans. We monitor and evaluate collateral values on impaired loans quarterly. Appraisals are required on all impaired loans every 18-24 months, or sooner as conditions necessitate. We monitor real estate values by market for our larger market areas. Based on trends in real estate values, adjustments may be made to the appraised value based on time elapsed between the appraisal date and the impairment analysis or a new appraisal may be ordered. Appraised values in our smaller market areas may be adjusted based on trends identified through discussions with local realtors and appraisers. Appraisals are also adjusted for selling costs. The adjusted appraised value is then compared to the loan balance and any resulting shortfall is recorded in the allowance for loan losses as a specific valuation allowance. Overall increases in specific valuation allowances will result in higher provisions for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are also impacted by changes in the historical or general valuation elements of the allowance for loan losses as well.\nTotal non-performing loans increased $7 million, or 11.2%, to $72 million as of December 31, 2015, from $65 million as of December 31, 2014, and decreased $32 million, or 33.0%, to $65 million as of December 31, 2014, from $97 million as of December 31, 2013. Non-accrual loans, the largest component of non-performing loans, increased $4 million, or 6.8%, to $66 million as of December 31, 2015, from $62 million as of December 31, 2014, primarily due to placement of the loans of one commercial borrower on non-accrual status. Non-accrual loans decreased $32 million, or 34.2%, to $62 million as of December 31, 2014, from $94 million as of December 31, 2013, primarily due to pay-downs and the return of performing loans to accrual status.\nWe generally place loans on non-accrual when they become 90 days past due, unless they are well secured and in the process of collection. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, any interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed from income. Approximately $3.2 million, $4.0 million and $4.6 million of gross interest income would have been accrued if all loans on non-accrual had been current in accordance with their original terms for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nLoans are returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and when, in the opinion of management, the loans are estimated to be fully collectible as to both principal and interest. Loans returned to accrual status are no longer considered impaired.\nLoans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest increased $3 million, or 117.5%, to $6 million as of December 31, 2015, from $3 million as of December 31, 2014, primarily due to the loans of one borrower that were in the process of renewal as of December 31, 2015.\nThe following table sets forth the allocation of our

OREO consists of real property acquired through foreclosure on the collateral underlying defaulted loans. We initially record OREO at fair value less estimated selling costs. Any excess of loan carrying value over the fair value of the real estate acquired is recorded as a charge against the allowance for loan losses. Estimated losses that result from the ongoing periodic valuation of these properties are charged to earnings in the period in which they are identified. The fair values of OREO properties are estimated using appraisals and management estimates of current market conditions. OREO properties are appraised every 18-24 months unless deterioration in local market conditions indicates the need to obtain new appraisals sooner. OREO properties are evaluated by management quarterly to determine if additional write-downs are appropriate or necessary based on current market conditions. Quarterly evaluations include a review of the most recent appraisal of the property and reviews of recent appraisals and comparable sales data for similar properties in the same or adjacent market areas. Commercial and agricultural OREO properties are listed with unrelated third party professional real estate agents or brokers local to the areas where the marketed properties are located. Residential properties are typically listed with local realtors, after any redemption period has expired. We rely on these local real estate agents and/or brokers to list the properties on the local multiple listing system, to provide marketing materials and advertisements for the properties and to conduct open houses.\nOREO decreased $7 million, or 53.9%, to $6 million as of December 31, 2015, from $14 million as of December 31, 2014. During 2015,we recorded additions to OREO of $6 million and sold OREO with a book value of $13 million at a $3.0 million gain. As of December 31, 2015, 34% of our OREO balance related to land and land development properties, 33% to commercial properties, 27% to residential real estate properties, 5% to agricultural real estate properties and 1% to construction properties.\nOREO decreased $2 million, or 12.6%, to $14 million as of December 31, 2014, from $16 million as of December 31, 2013. During 2014, we recorded additions to OREO of $9 million, $4 million of which were acquired in conjunction with the MWFC acquisition, wrote down the fair value of OREO properties by $224 thousand and sold OREO with a book value of $11 million.\nTroubled Debt Restructurings. Modifications of performing loans are made in the ordinary course of business and are completed on a case-by-case basis as negotiated with the borrower. Loan modifications typically include interest rate concessions, interest-only periods, short-term payment deferrals and extension of amortization periods to provide payment relief. A loan modification is considered a troubled debt restructuring if the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and we, for economic or legal reasons, grant a concession to the borrower that we would not otherwise consider. Those modifications deemed to be troubled debt restructurings are monitored centrally to ensure proper classification as a troubled debt restructuring and if or when the loan may be placed on accrual status.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had loans renegotiated in troubled debt restructurings of $40 million, of which $25 million were reported as non-accrual loans in the non-performing asset and troubled debt restructuring and non-performing loan tables above. The remaining $15 million were on accrual status and are reported as troubled debt restructurings in the non-performing asset and troubled debt restructurings table above.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had loans renegotiated in troubled debt restructurings of $44 million, of which $23 million were reported as non-accrual loans in the non-performing asset and troubled debt restructurings and non-performing loan tables above. The remaining $21 million were on accrual status and are reported as troubled debt restructurings in the non-performing asset and troubled debt restructurings table above.\nFor additional information regarding loans modified in troubled debt restructurings, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Loans\u201d included in financial statements included Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe Company performs a quarterly assessment of the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The methodology used to assess the adequacy is consistently applied to the Company's loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses based on our evaluation of known and inherent risk in our loan portfolio at each balance sheet date. In determining the allowance for loan losses, we estimate losses on specific loans, or groups of loans, where the probable loss can be identified and reasonably determined. The balance of the allowance for loan losses is based on internally assigned risk classifications of loans, historical loan loss rates, changes in the nature of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality, industry concentrations, delinquency trends, current economic factors and the estimated impact of current economic conditions on certain historical loan loss rates. See the discussion under Critical Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies - Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d above.\nThe allowance for loan losses is increased by provisions charged against earnings and recoveries of charged-off loans and is reduced by negative provisions credited to earnings and loan charge-offs. Loans, or portions thereof, are charged-off when management believes that the collectibility of the principal is unlikely or, with respect to consumer installment and credit card loans, according to established delinquency schedules.\nThe allowance for loan losses consists of three elements:\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Specific valuation allowances associated with impaired loans. Specific valuation allowances are determined based on assessment of the fair value of the collateral underlying the loans as determined through independent appraisals, the present value of future cash flows, observable market prices and any relevant qualitative or environmental factors impacting the loan. No specific valuation allowances are recorded for impaired loans that are adequately secured.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Historical valuation allowances based on loan loss experience for similar loans with similar characteristics and trends. Historical valuation allowances are determined by applying percentage loss factors to the credit exposures from outstanding loans. For commercial, agricultural and real estate loans, loss factors are applied based on the internal risk classifications of these loans. For consumer loans, loss factors are applied on a portfolio basis. For commercial, agriculture and real estate loans, loss factor percentages are based on a migration analysis of our historical loss experience, designed to account for credit deterioration. For consumer loans, loss factor percentages are based on a one-year loss history.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> (3) General valuation allowances determined based on changes in the nature of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality, industry concentrations, delinquency trends, general economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to us.\nBased on the assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, management records provisions for loan losses to maintain the allowance for loan losses at appropriate levels.\nLoans acquired in business combinations are recorded at fair value with no allowance for loan losses on the date of acquisition. Subsequent to the acquisition date, an allowance for loan loss is recorded for the emergence of new probable and estimable losses on loans acquired without evidence of credit impairment. Loans acquired with evidence of credit impairment are regularly monitored and to the extent that the performance has deteriorated from management's expectations at the date of acquisition, an allowance for loan losses is established. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, management determined that an allowance for loan losses of $382 thousand and $287 thousand, respectively, was required for acquired loans under generally accepted accounting principles.\nLoans, or portions thereof, are charged-off against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely, or, with respect to consumer installment loans, according to an established delinquency schedule. Generally, loans are charged-off when (1) there has been no material principal reduction within the previous 90 days and there is no pending sale of collateral or other assets, (2) there is no significant or pending event which will result in principal reduction within the upcoming 90 days, (3) it is clear that we will not be able to collect all or a portion of the loan, (4) payments on the loan are sporadic, will result in an excessive amortization or are not consistent with the collateral held and (5) foreclosure or repossession actions are pending. Loan charge-offs do not directly correspond with the receipt of independent appraisals or the use of observable market data if the collateral value is determined to be sufficient to repay the principal balance of the loan.\nIf the impaired loan is adequately collateralized, a specific valuation allowance is not recorded. As such, significant changes in impaired and non-performing loans do not necessarily correspond proportionally with changes in the specific valuation component of the allowance for loan losses. Additionally, management expects the timing of charge-offs will vary between quarters and will not necessarily correspond proportionally to changes in the allowance for loan losses or changes in non-performing or impaired loans due to timing differences among the initial identification of an impaired loan, recording of a specific valuation allowance for the impaired loan and any resulting charge-off of uncollectible principal.\nIn response to declines in national, regional and local economies we recorded additional general valuation allowances based on management's estimation of the probable impact that the declines would have on our loan portfolio. Accordingly, we recorded significantly higher provisions for loan losses in 2011 to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level. Impaired and non-performing loans peaked in mid-2011 and our provision for loan losses, which began decreasing during the last half of 2011, continued to decrease through 2014, with negative provisions recorded during the last half of 2013 and the first half of 2014. During 2015, we recorded provisions for loan losses of $6.8 million, of which $3.3 million was recorded during fourth quarter. Approximately 73% of the fourth quarter 2015 provision for loan losses was the result of specific reserves related to the loans of one borrower. This compares to a reversal of provision for loan losses of $6.6 million in 2014. Increases in provisions for loan losses during 2015, as compared to 2014, are reflective of loan growth and increases in specific reserves primarily related to four commercial real estate relationships.\nThe following table sets forth information concerning our allowance for loan losses as of the dates and for the periods indicated.\nTable 114: <table><tr><td>Allowance for Loan

loans, at December 31, 2015, compared to $74 million, or 1.52% of period-end loans, at December 31, 2014, and $85 million, or 1.96% of period-end loans, at December 31, 2013. The decrease in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans as of December 31, 2015, compared to December 31, 2014, is primarily due to organic loan growth and the addition of acquired loans which are initially recorded at fair vale with no carryover of the related allowance for loan losses. The decreases in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans as of December 31, 2014, compared to December 31, 2013, was largely due to the acquisition of MWFC loans, which were initially recorded at fair value with no carryover of the related allowance for loan losses.\nAlthough we believe that we have established our allowance for loan losses in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and that the allowance for loan losses was adequate to provide for known and inherent losses in the portfolio at all times during the five-year period ended December 31, 2015, future provisions will be subject to on-going evaluations of the risks in the loan portfolio. If the economy declines or asset quality deteriorates, material additional provisions could be required.\nThe allowance for loan losses is allocated to loan categories based on the relative risk characteristics, asset classifications and actual loss experience of the loan portfolio. The following table provides a summary of the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for specific loan categories as of the dates indicated. The allocations presented should not be interpreted as an indication that charges to the allowance for loan losses will be incurred in these amounts or proportions, or that the portion\nof the allowance allocated to each loan category represents the total amount available for future losses that may occur within these categories. The unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses and the total allowance are applicable to the entire loan portfolio.\nTable 115: <table><tr><td>Allocation of the Allowance for Loan Losses\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31,\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>2012\n</td> <td>2011\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Allocated\nReserves\n</td> <td>% of\nLoan\nCategory\nto Total\nLoans\n</td> <td>Allocated\nReserves\n</td> <td>% of\nLoan\nCategory\nto Total\nLoans\n</td> <td>Allocated\nReserves\n</td> <td>% of\nLoan\nCategory\nto Total\nLoans\n</td> <td>Allocated\nReserves\n</td> <td>% of\nLoan\nCategory\nto Total\nLoans\n</td> <td>Allocated\nReserves\n</td> <td>% of\nLoan\nCategory\nto Total\nLoans\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer\n</td> <td>5,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>18,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agricultural\n</td> <td>602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>974\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other loans\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage loans held for sale\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>112,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe allowance for loan losses allocated to commercial loans increased 31.2% to $19 million as of December 31, 2015, from $14 million as of December 31, 2014, primarily due to increases in specific valuation allowances on impaired loans. The allowance for loan losses allocated to real estate loans decreased 15.7% to $54 million as of December 31, 2014, from $64 million as of December 31, 2013, and decreased 15.6% to $64 million as of December 31 2013, from $76 million as of December 31, 2012, primarily due to improvement in real estate values and housing demand in our market areas. The allowance for loan losses allocated to real estate loans decreased 13.3% to $76 million as of December 31, 2012, from $87 million as of December 31, 2011, primarily due to the charge-off of non-performing loans.\nInvestment Securities\nWe manage our investment portfolio to obtain the highest yield possible, while meeting our risk tolerance and liquidity guidelines and satisfying the pledging requirements for deposits of state and political subdivisions and securities sold under repurchase agreements. Our portfolio principally comprises U.S. government agency residential mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, U.S. government agency securities and tax exempt securities. Federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits in bank are additional investments that are classified as cash equivalents rather than as investment securities. Investment securities classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value, while investment securities classified as held-to-maturity are recorded at amortized cost. Unrealized gains or losses, net of the deferred tax effect, on available-for-sale securities are reported as increases or decreases in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of stockholders' equity.\nInvestment securities decreased $230 million, or 10.0%, to $2,058 million as of December 31, 2015, from $2,287 million as of December 31, 2014. Proceeds from maturities and paydowns were primarily used to fund loan growth during 2015. Investment securities increased $136 million, or 6.3%, to $2,287 million as of December 31, 2014, from $2,152 million as of December 31, 2013, with approximately $37 million of the increase attributable to investment securities acquired in conjunction with the MWFC acquisition. The remaining increase was due to investment of funds generated through deposit growth.\nOn October 31, 2015, we transferred available-for-sale U.S. agency residential mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations with amortized costs and fair values of $100 million and $100 million, respectively, into the held-to-maturity category. Net unrealized losses of $203 thousand included in accumulated other comprehensive income at the time of the transfer are being amortized to yield over the remaining expected lives of the transferred securities of 4.0 years. On June 27, 2014, we transferred available-for-sale U.S. agency residential mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations with amortized costs and fair values of $397 million and $389 million, respectively, into the held-to-maturity category. Net unrealized losses of $8 million included in accumulated other comprehensive income at the time of the transfer are being amortized to yield over the remaining expected lives of the transferred securities of 4.3 years.\nThe following table sets forth the book value, percentage of total investment securities and weighted average yields on investment securities as of December 31, 2015. Weighted-average yields have been computed on a fully taxable-equivalent basis using a tax rate of 35%.\nTable 116: <table><tr><td>Securities Maturities and Yield\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td>

noted above reflect $99 million of investment securities at their final maturities although they have call provisions within the next year. Based on current market interest rates, management expects approximately $78 million of these securities will be called in 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the estimated duration of our investment portfolio was 2.8 years, as compared to 3.0 years as of December 31, 2014. The weighted average yield on investment securities decreased 3 basis points to 1.70% in 2015, from 1.73% in 2014, and 7 basis points to 1.73% in 2014, from 1.80% in 2013.\nAs of December 31, 2015, investment securities with amortized costs and fair values of $1,325 million and $1,329 million, respectively, were pledged to secure public deposits and securities sold under repurchase agreements, as compared to $1,352 million and $1,356 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2014. For additional information concerning securities sold under repurchase agreements, see -Securities Sold Under Repurchase Agreements\u201d included herein.\nMortgage-backed securities, and to a limited extent other securities, have uncertain cash flow characteristics that present additional interest rate risk in the form of prepayment or extension risk primarily caused by changes in market interest rates. This additional risk is generally rewarded in the form of higher yields. Maturities of mortgage-backed securities presented above have been adjusted to reflect shorter maturities based upon estimated prepayments of principal. As of December 31, 2015, the carrying value of our investments in non-agency mortgage-backed securities totaled $156 thousand. All other mortgage-backed securities included in the table above were issued by U.S. government agencies and corporations. As of December 31, 2015, there were no significant concentrations of investments (greater than 10% of stockholders' equity) in any individual security issuer, except for U.S. government or agency-backed securities.\nAs of December 31, 2015, approximately 81% of our tax-exempt securities were general obligation securities, of which 56% were issued by political subdivisions or agencies within the states of Montana, Wyoming and South Dakota.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had U.S. government agency securities with carrying values of $721 million and a weighted average yield of 1.20%; mortgage-backed securities with carrying values of $1,344 million and a weighted average yield of 2.15%; tax exempt securities with carrying values of $189 million and a weighted average tax equivalent yield of 4.43%; corporate securities with carrying values of $33 million and a weighted average yield of 1.60%; and, other securities with carrying values of $504 thousand with a weighted average yield of 7.67%.\nAs of December 31, 2013, we had U.S. government agency securities with carrying values of $763 million and a weighted average yield of 1.10%; mortgage-backed securities with carrying values of $1,184 million and a weighted average yield of 2.15%; tax exempt securities with carrying values of $186 million and a weighted average tax equivalent yield of 4.65%; and, corporate securities with carrying values of $18 million and a weighted average yield of 1.20%.\nWe evaluate our investment portfolio quarterly for other-than-temporary declines in the market value of individual investment securities. This evaluation includes monitoring credit ratings; market, industry and corporate news; volatility in market prices; and, determining whether the market value of a security has been below its cost for an extended period of time. As of December 31, 2015, we had investment securities with fair values of $162 million that had been in a continuous loss position more than twelve months. Gross unrealized losses on these securities totaled $2 million as of December 31, 2015, and were primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. No impairment losses were recorded during 2015, 2014 or 2013.\nFor additional information concerning investment securities, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Investment Securities\u201d included in Part IV, Item 15.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, amounts due from banks, federal funds sold for one day periods and interest bearing deposits in banks with original maturities of less than three months. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $18 million, or 2.3%, to $780 million as of December 31, 2015, from $799 million as of December 31, 2014. During 2015, loan growth, debt repayment and stock repurchases were funded through available funds resulting in decreases in cash and cash equivalents from December 31, 2014. Cash and cash equivalents increased $264 million, or 49.3%, to $799 million as of December 31, 2014, from $535 million as of December 31, 2013. Fluctuations in cash and cash equivalents occur in the normal course of business and are not reflective of changes in business plan or strategy.\nGoodwill. Goodwill decreased $1 million to $205 million as of December 31, 2015, from $206 million as of December 31, 2014. During third quarter 2015, we recorded goodwill of $148 thousand in conjunction with the Absarokee acquisition. This increase was offset by a $1 million decrease in recorded goodwill resulting from the finalization of the fair valuation of deferred tax assets acquired in the MWFC acquisition.\nPremises and Equipment\nPremises and equipment decreased $4 million, or 2.3%, to $191 million as of December 31, 2015, from $195 million as of December 31, 2014. Premises and equipment increased $16 million, or 8.6%, to $195 million as of December 31, 2014, from $180 million as of December 31, 2013. In conjunction with the MWFC acquisition, we acquired premises and equipment with fair values aggregating $29 million. Subsequently, we sold $8 million of the vacated MWFC premises and equipment at carrying value. In addition, during fourth quarter 2014, we sold two FIB bank buildings with carrying values of $2 million at a net gain of $1.2 million.\nCompany-Owned Life Insurance\nCompany-owned life insurance increased $33 million, or 21.7%, to $187 million as of December 31, 2015, from $154 million as of December 31, 2014, due to the purchase of an additional $30 million of life insurance covering selected officers of our bank subsidiary and increases in cash surrender values of existing policies. Company-owned life insurance increased $32 million, or 25.9% to $154 million as of December 31, 2014, from $122 million as of December 31, 2013. In conjunction with the MWFC acquisition, we obtained group life insurance policies covering certain key employees of MWB. The net cash surrender value of these policies was $13 million at December 31, 2014. In addition, in January 2014, we purchased an additional $15 million of life insurance covering select officers of our bank subsidiary. For additional information regarding our company-owned life insurance, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Company-Owned Life Insurance\u201d included in Part IV, Item 15.\nDeferred Tax Asset/Liability\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had a net deferred tax liability of $10 million, as compared to a net deferred tax asset of $5 million as of December 31, 2014. The shift in deferred taxes from a net asset to a net liability was primarily due to decreases in deferred tax assets related to discounts on acquired loans and unrealized losses on available-for sale investment securities. The shift in the deferred taxes from a net asset to a net liability was also impacted by increases in deferred tax liabilities related to tax deductible goodwill from previous acquisitions and increases in deferred tax liabilities related to depreciation of fixed assets.\nOur net deferred tax asset decreased $7 million, or 59.9%, to $5 million as of December, 31, 2014, from $12 million as of December 31, 2013, Increases in net deferred tax assets resulting from the MWFC acquisition were more than offset by decreases related to unrealized losses on available-for-sale investment securities, reductions in temporary timing differences associated with our allowance for loan losses and increases in deferred tax liabilities related to tax deductible goodwill from previous acquisitions.\nOther Assets\nOther assets increased $5 million, or 6.2%, to $78 million as of December 31, 2015, from $73 million as of December 31, 2014, primarily due to increases in tax credit investments under the New Markets Tax Credit Program. Other assets increased $12 million, or 20.4%, to $73 million as of December 31, 2014, from $61 million as of December 31, 2013, primarily due to other assets acquired in, and increases in Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve Bank stock holding requirements resulting from, the MWFC acquisition.\nDeposits\nWe emphasize developing relationships with our customers in order to increase our core deposit base, which is our primary funding source. Our deposits consist of non-interest bearing and interest bearing demand, savings, individual retirement and time deposit accounts.\nThe following table summarizes our deposits as of the dates indicated:\nTable 117: <table><tr><td>Deposits\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31,\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> <td>2012\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> <td>2011\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-interest bearing demand\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,823,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,791,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,491,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,495,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,271,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest bearing:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Demand\n</td> <td>2,178,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,133,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,848,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,811,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,306,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Savings\n</td> <td>1,955,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,843,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,602,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,547,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,691,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time, $100 or more\n</td> <td>487,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>520,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>492,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>594,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>681,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time, other\n</td> <td>644,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>718,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>698,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>790,772\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>876,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest bearing\n</td> <td>5,265,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,214,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,642,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,745,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,555,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total deposits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,088,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,006,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,133,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,240,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,826,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal deposits increased $83 million, or 1.2%, to $7,089 million as of December 31, 2015, from $7,006 million as of December 31, 2014, with approximately $64 million of the increase attributable to the Absarokee acquisition in July 2015. During 2015, the mix of deposits continued to shift from higher-costing time deposits to lower-costing savings and demand deposits. Management attributes this ongoing shift to the sustained low interest rate environment experienced during recent years as many customers appear to have become less inclined to invest their funds for extended periods.\nTotal deposits increased $872 million, or 14.2%, to $7,006 million as of December 31, 2014, from $6,134 million as of December 31, 2013. During 2014, we acquired approximately $515 million of deposits in connection with the acquisition of MWFC, including approximately $67 million of non-interest bearing demand deposits, $178 million of interest bearing demand deposits, $111 million of savings deposits, $68 million of time deposits of $100,000 or more, and $91 million of other time deposits.\nNon-Interest Bearing Demand. Non-interest bearing demand deposits increased $32 million, or 1.8%, to $1,824 million as of December 31, 2015, from $1,791 million as of December 31, 2014, with approximately $10 million of the increase attributable to the Absarokee acquisition. Non-interest bearing demand deposits increased $300 million, or 20.1%, to $1,791 million as of December 31, 2014, from $1,492 million as of December 31, 2013. Exclusive of acquired MWFC deposits, non-interest bearing demand deposits increased $233 million, or 15.6%, compared to December 31, 2013, due to organic growth.\nInterest Bearing Demand. Interest bearing demand deposits increased $45 million, or 2.1%, to $2,178 million as of December 31, 2015, from $2,133 million as of December 31, 2014, with approximately $13 million of the increase attributable to the Absarokee acquisition. Interest bearing demand deposits increased $284 million, or 15.4%, to $2,133 million as of December 31, 2014, from $1,849 million as of December 31, 2013. Exclusive of acquired MWFC deposits, interest bearing demand deposits increased $106 million, or 5.7%, compared to December 31, 2013, due to organic growth.\nSavings Deposits. Savings deposits increased $112 million, or 6.1%, to $1,955 million as of December 31, 2015, from $1,843 million as of December 31, 2014, with approximately $24 million of the increase attributable to the Absarokee acquisition. Savings deposits increased $241 million, or 15.0%, to $1,843 million as of December 31, 2014, from $1,603 million as of December 31, 2013. Exclusive of acquired MWFC deposits, savings deposits increased $130 million, or 8.1%, compared to December 31, 2013, due to organic growth.\nManagement attributes organic growth in non-interest bearing demand, interest bearing demand and savings deposits during 2015 and 2014 to changes in customer liquidity combined with continued low interest rates offered on alternative interest earning deposit products.\nTime deposits of $100,000 or more. Time deposits of $100,000 or more decreased $33 million, or 6.3%, to $487 million as of December 31, 2015, from $520 million as of December 31, 2014. Exclusive of deposits acquired in the Absarokee acquisition, time deposits of $100,000 or more decreased approximately $41 million, or 7.8%, from December 31, 2014. Time deposits of $100,000 or more increased $28 million, or 5.7%, to $520 million as of December 31, 2014, from $492 million as of December 31, 2013. Exclusive of deposits acquired in the MWFC acquisition, time deposits of $100,000 or more decreased approximately $40 million, or 8.0%, from December 31, 2013.\nOther Time deposits. Other time deposits decreased $74 million, or 10.3%, to $644 million as of December 31, 2015, from $718 million as of December 31, 2014. Exclusive of deposits acquired in the Absarokee acquisition, other time deposits decreased approximately $81 million, or 11.3%, from December 31, 2014. Other time deposits increased $19 million, or 2.8%, to $718 million as of December 31, 2014, from $699 million as of December 31, 2013. Exclusive of deposits acquired in the MWFC acquisition, other time deposits decreased approximately $72 million, or 10.3%, from December 31, 2013.\nManagement attributes organic decreases in time deposits during 2015 and 2014 to the impact of a continued low interest rate environment as many customers appear to have become less inclined to invest their funds for extended periods.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service, or CDARS, deposits of $38 million and $40 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had no certificates of deposit issued in brokered transactions.\nFor additional information concerning customer deposits, including the use of repurchase agreements, see Business-Community Banking-Deposit Products,\u201d included in Part I, Item 1 and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Deposits,\u201d included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nSecurities Sold Under Repurchase Agreements\nUnder repurchase agreements with commercial and municipal depositors, customer deposit balances are invested in short-term U.S. government agency securities overnight and are then repurchased the following day. All outstanding repurchase agreements are due in one day. Repurchase agreement balances increased $8 million, or 1.7%, to $511 million as of December 31, 2015, from $502 million as of December 31, 2014, and increased $45 million, or 9.8%, to $502 million as of December 31, 2014, from $457 million as of December 31, 2013. Fluctuations in repurchase agreement balances correspond with fluctuations in the liquidity of our customers.\nThe following table sets forth certain information regarding securities sold under repurchase agreements as of the dates indicated:\nTable 118: <table><tr><td>Securities Sold Under Repurchase Agreements\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of and for the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securities sold under repurchase agreements:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at period end\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>510,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>502,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>457,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average balance\n</td> <td>456,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>454,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>456,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maximum amount outstanding at any month-end\n</td> <td>510,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>547,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>533,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average interest rate:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>During the year\n</td> <td>0.05\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>0.05\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>0.06\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>At period end\n</td> <td>0.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLong-Term Debt. Long-term debt decreased $10 million, or 26.7%, to $28 million as of December 31, 2015, from $38 million as of December 31, 2014. On January 29, 2015, we borrowed $5 million on a 2.28% note payable maturing July 29, 2022, with interest payable monthly and principal due at maturity. The note is collateralized by our equity interest in Universal Sub CDE, LLC, a community development entity owned 99.9% by us. This increase was more than offset by the fourth quarter 2015 early repayment of a $15 million variable rate subordinated term loan with an original maturity date of February 28, 2018. There were no prepayment penalties associated with the repayment. Long-term debt increased $1 million, or 3.1%, to $38 million as of December 31, 2014, from $37 million as of December 31, 2013. For additional information regarding the long-term debt, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Long-Term Debt,\u201d included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nSubordinated Debentures Held by Subsidiary Trusts\nSubordinated debentures held by subsidiary trusts remained unchanged at $82 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. In conjunction with the acquisition of MWFC in July 2014, we assumed $20 million of subordinated debentures held by two business trusts, Mountain West Statutory Trust III and Mountain West Statutory Trust IV (collectively, the Mountain West Subordinated Debentures\u201d). On December 15, 2014, we redeemed $14 million of the Mountain West Subordinated Debentures bearing a cumulative floating interest rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.85% per annum, and on December 26, 2014, we redeemed\nthe remaining $6 million of the Mountain West Subordinated Debentures bearing a cumulative floating interest rate equal to LIBOR plus 3.10% per annum. The redemption price of the Mountain West Subordinated Debentures was equal to the $1 liquidation amount of each debenture plus all accrued and unpaid distributions to the date of redemption. The redemption of the Mountain West Subordinated Debentures caused a mandatory redemption of $20 million of Mountain West Trust Preferred Securities and $614 thousand of common equity securities. For additional information regarding the Subordinated Debentures, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Subordinated Debentures Held by Subsidiary Trusts,\u201d included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nAccounts Payable and Accrued Expenses\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses decreased $13 million, or 19.8%, to $53 million as of December 31, 2015, from $66 million as of December 31, 2014. This decrease is primarily due to timing and amounts of corporate tax payments and lower incentive bonus and profit sharing accruals. Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased $19 million, or 39.2%, to $66 million as of December 31, 2014, from $48 million as of December 31, 2013, primarily due to the timing and amounts of corporate tax payments.\nContractual Obligations\nContractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 are summarized in the following table.\nTable 119: <table><tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Within\nOne Year\n</td> <td>One Year to\nThree Years\n</td> <td>Three Years\nto Five Years\n</td> <td>After\nFive Years\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposits without a stated maturity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,957,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,957,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time deposits\n</td> <td>737,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>278,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,131,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securities sold under repurchase agreements\n</td> <td>510,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>510,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other borrowed funds (1)\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations (2)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>65\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>2,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (3)\n</td> <td>1,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated debentures held by subsidiary trusts (4)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,208,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>302,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>98,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,728,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Included in other borrowed funds are tax deposits made by customers pending subsequent withdrawal by the federal government.

These obligations represent actuarially determined future benefit payments to eligible plan participants. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Employee Benefit Plans\u201d included in Part IV, Item 15.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have entered into various arrangements not reflected on the consolidated balance sheet that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. These include guarantees, commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit.\nWe guarantee the distributions and payments for redemption or liquidation of capital trust preferred securities issued by our wholly-owned subsidiary business trusts to the extent of funds held by the trusts. Although the guarantees are not separately recorded, the obligations underlying the guarantees are fully reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as subordinated debentures held by subsidiary trusts. The subordinated debentures currently qualify as tier 1 capital under the Federal Reserve capital adequacy guidelines. For additional information regarding the subordinated debentures, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Subordinated Debentures Held by Subsidiary Trusts\u201d included in Part IV, Item 15.\nWe are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. For additional information regarding our off-balance sheet arrangements, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk\u201d included in Part IV, Item 15.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity Management\nCapital Resources\nStockholders' equity is influenced primarily by earnings, dividends, sales and redemptions of common stock and changes in the unrealized holding gains or losses, net of taxes, on available-for-sale investment securities. Stockholders' equity increased $42 million, or 4.6%, to $950 million as of December 31, 2015 from $909 million as of December 31, 2014, due primarily to the retention of earnings. Increases in stockholders' equity due to earnings retention were partially offset by the repurchase and retirement of our common stock. During 2015, we repurchased and retired 765,875 shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions at an aggregate purchase price of $19.9 million. The repurchases were made pursuant to a stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in January 2015. On September 24, 2015, our Board of Directors reauthorized the repurchase of up to one million shares of our Class A common stock under the repurchase program. We paid aggregate cash dividends of $36.3 million to common shareholders during 2015. On January 21, 2016, we declared a quarterly dividend to common stockholders of $0.22 per share, which was paid on February 12, 2016 to shareholders of record as of February 1, 2016.\nStockholders' equity increased $107 million, or 13.4%, to $909 million as of December 31, 2014 from $802 million as of December 31, 2013, due primarily to the retention of earnings, the issuance of 1,378,230 shares of Class A common stock with an aggregate value of $36 million as partial consideration for the acquisition of MWFC and decreases in net unrealized losses on available-for-sale investment securities. We paid aggregate cash dividends of $28.6 million to common shareholders during 2014. Also during 2014, we repurchased and retired 362,121 of our shares of Class A common stock in a combination of privately negotiated and open market transactions at an aggregate purchase price of $9.1 million. The repurchases were made pursuant to a stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in November 2013, authorizing the repurchase of up to 2 million shares of our Class A common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions through November 14, 2014. For additional information regarding the repurchases, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Capital Stock and Dividend Restrictions\u201d included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nOn April 3, 2015, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-8 to register 2,000,000 shares of Class A common stock to be issued pursuant to the Company's 2015 Equity and Incentive Plan.\nOn January 24, 2014, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-8 to register 1,500,000 shares of Class A common stock to be issued pursuant to the Company's 2006 Equity Compensation Plan, as amended and restated. All shares of common stock available for future grant under the 2006 Equity Compensation Plan, as amended and restated, were transferred into the 2015 Equity and Incentive Plan in April 2015.\nOn May 24, 2013, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which was subsequently declared effective by the SEC. The registration statement permits us to offer and sell up to $160 million of our Class A common shares in one or more future public offerings. At the present time, we have no specific plans to offer any of the securities covered by the registration statement.\nOn July 2, 2013, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank, or the Federal Reserve Board, issued a final rule implementing a revised regulatory capital framework for U.S. banks in accordance with the Basel III international accord and satisfying related mandates under the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the final rule, minimum capital requirements will increase for both quantity and quality of capital held by banking organizations. The final rule includes a new common equity tier 1 minimum capital requirement of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets and increases the minimum tier 1 capital requirement from 4.0% to 6.0% of risk-weighted assets. The minimum total risk-based capital remains unchanged at 8.0% of total risk-weighted assets. In addition to the minimum common equity tier 1, tier 1 and total risk-based capital requirements, the final rule requires banking organizations to hold a buffer of common equity tier 1 capital in an amount above 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The minimum regulatory capital requirements and compliance with a standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets of the final rule became effective for us on January 1, 2015. The capital conservation buffer framework transition period begins January 1, 2016, with full implementation effective January 1, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had capital levels that, in all cases, exceeded the well-capitalized guidelines. Additionally, our calculations indicate that as of December 31, 2015, we would meet all fully phased-in Basel III capital adequacy requirements. For additional information regarding the impact of this final rule, see \"Regulation and Supervision - Capital Standards and Prompt Corrective Action\" included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. For additional information regarding our capital levels, see Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements-Regulatory Capital,\u201d included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity measures our ability to meet current and future cash flow needs on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost. We manage our liquidity position to meet the daily cash flow needs of customers, while maintaining an appropriate balance between assets and liabilities to meet the return on investment objectives of our shareholders. Our liquidity position is supported by management of liquid assets and liabilities and access to alternative sources of funds. Liquid assets include cash, interest bearing deposits in banks, federal funds sold, available-for-sale investment securities and maturing or prepaying balances in our held-to-maturity investment and loan portfolios. Liquid liabilities include core deposits, federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements and borrowings. Other sources of liquidity include the sale of loans, the ability to acquire additional national market funds through non-core deposits, the issuance of additional collateralized borrowings such as FHLB advances, the issuance of debt securities, additional borrowings through the Federal Reserve's discount window and the issuance of preferred or common securities.\nOur short-term and long-term liquidity requirements are primarily to fund on-going operations, including payment of interest on deposits and debt, extensions of credit to borrowers, capital expenditures and shareholder dividends. These liquidity requirements are met primarily through cash flow from operations, redeployment of prepaying and maturing balances in our loan and investment portfolios, debt financing and increases in customer deposits. For additional information regarding our operating, investing and financing cash flows, see Consolidated Financial Statements-Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows,\u201d included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nAs a holding company, we are a corporation separate and apart from our subsidiary Bank and, therefore, we provide for our own liquidity. Our main sources of funding include management fees and dividends declared and paid by our subsidiaries and access to capital markets. There are statutory, regulatory and debt covenant limitations that affect the ability of our Bank to pay dividends to us. Management believes that such limitations will not impact our ability to meet our ongoing short-term cash obligations. For additional information regarding dividend restrictions, see -Financial Condition-Capital Resources and Liquidity Management\u201d above and Business-Regulation and Supervision-Restrictions on Transfers of Funds to Us and the Bank\u201d and Risk Factors-Risks Relating to the Market and Our Business.\"\nManagement continuously monitors our liquidity position and adjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate. Our management is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, capital resources or operations. In addition, our management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations regarding liquidity, which if implemented, would have a material adverse effect on us.", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I am

As of December 31, 2015, we had consolidated assets of $8.7 billion, deposits of $7.1 billion, loans of $5.2 billion and total stockholders' equity of $950 million.\nWe currently operate 79 banking offices, including detached drive-up facilities, in 45 communities located in Montana, Wyoming and South Dakota. We also offer internet and mobile banking services. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, FIB, we deliver a comprehensive range of banking products and services to individuals, businesses, municipalities and other entities throughout our market areas. Our customers participate in a wide variety of industries, including energy, healthcare and professional services, education and governmental services, construction, mining, agriculture, retail and wholesale trade and tourism.\nOur Business\nOur principal business activity is lending to, accepting deposits from and conducting financial transactions for individuals, businesses, municipalities and other entities. We derive our income principally from interest charged on loans and, to a lesser extent, from interest and dividends earned on investments. We also derive income from non-interest sources such as fees received in connection with various lending and deposit services; trust, employee benefit, investment and insurance services; mortgage loan originations, sales and servicing; merchant and electronic banking services; and from time to time, gains on sales of assets. Our principal expenses include interest expense on deposits and borrowings, operating expenses, provisions for loan losses and income tax expense.\nOur loan portfolio consists of a mix of real estate, consumer, commercial, agricultural and other loans, including fixed and variable rate loans. Our real estate loans comprise commercial real estate, construction (including residential, commercial and land development loans), residential, agricultural and other real estate loans. Fluctuations in the loan portfolio are directly related to the economies of the communities we serve. While each loan originated generally must meet minimum underwriting standards established in our credit policies, lending officers are granted discretion within pre-approved limits in approving and pricing loans to assure that the banking offices are responsive to competitive issues and community needs in each market area. We fund our loan portfolio primarily with the core deposits from our customers, generally without utilizing brokered deposits and with minimal reliance on wholesale funding sources. For additional information about our underwriting standards and loan approval process, see \"Business-Lending Activities,\" included in Part I, Item 1 of this report.\nRecent Trends and Developments\nOn July 24, 2015, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Absarokee Bancorporation, Inc., or Absarokee, a Montana-based bank holding company operating one wholly-owned subsidiary bank, United Bank, with branches located in three Montana communities adjacent to the Company's existing market areas. United Bank was merged with FIB immediately subsequent to the acquisition. We paid cash consideration for the acquisition of $7.2 million. As of the acquisition date, Absarokee had total assets of $75 million, loans of $37 million and deposits of $64 million. For additional information regarding the acquisition, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Acquisition,\u201d included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nOn July 2, 2013, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank issued a final rule implementing a revised regulatory capital framework for U.S. banks in accordance with the Basel III international accord. The revised regulatory capital framework, or Basel III, became effective for us on January 1, 2015. Basel III includes a more stringent definition of capital and introduces a new common equity tier 1, or CET1, capital requirement, sets forth a comprehensive methodology for calculating risk-weighted assets, introduces a conservation buffer and sets out minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards. Certain deductions and adjustments to regulatory capital phase in starting January 1, 2015 and will be fully implemented on January 1, 2018. The capital conservation buffer phases in beginning January 1, 2016 and will be fully\nimplemented on January 1, 2019. As of December 31, 2015, we had capital levels that, in all cases, exceeded the well-capitalized guidelines. For additional information regarding our capital levels, see \"Capital Resources and Liquidity Management\" included herein and Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements-Regulatory Capital,\u201d included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nPrimary Factors Used in Evaluating Our Business\nAs a banking institution, we manage and evaluate various aspects of both our financial condition and our results of operations. We monitor our financial condition and performance and evaluate the levels and trends of the line items included in our balance sheet and statements of income, as well as various financial ratios that are commonly used in our industry. We analyze these ratios and financial trends against both our own historical levels and the financial condition and performance of comparable banking institutions in our region and nationally.\nResults of Operations\nPrincipal factors used in managing and evaluating our results of operations include return on average assets, net interest income, non-interest income, non-interest expense and net income. Net interest income is affected by the level of interest rates, changes in interest rates and changes in the volume and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. The most significant impact on our net interest income between periods is derived from the interaction of changes in the rates earned or paid on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, which we refer to as interest rate spread. The volume of loans, investment securities and other interest earning assets, compared to the volume of interest bearing deposits and indebtedness, combined with the interest rate spread, produces changes in our net interest income between periods. Non-interest bearing sources of funds, such as demand deposits and stockholders' equity, also support earning assets.\nThe impact of free funding sources is captured in the net interest margin, which is calculated as net interest income divided by average earning assets. We evaluate our net interest income on factors that include the yields on our loans and other earning assets, the costs of our deposits and other funding sources, the levels of our net interest spread and net interest margin.\nWe seek to increase our non-interest income over time and we evaluate our non-interest income relative to the trends of the individual types of non-interest income in view of prevailing market conditions.\nWe manage our non-interest expenses in consideration of growth opportunities and our community banking model that emphasizes customer service and responsiveness. We evaluate our non-interest expense on factors that include our non-interest expense relative to our average assets, our efficiency ratio and the trends of the individual categories of non-interest expense.\nFinally, we seek to increase our net income and provide favorable shareholder returns over time, and we evaluate our net income relative to the performance of other bank holding companies on factors that include return on average assets, return on average equity, total shareholder return and growth in earnings.\nFinancial Condition\nPrincipal areas of focus in managing and evaluating our financial condition include liquidity, the diversification and quality of our loans, the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, the diversification and terms of our deposits and other funding sources, the re-pricing characteristics and maturities of our assets and liabilities, including potential interest rate exposure and the adequacy of our capital levels. We seek to maintain sufficient levels of cash and investment securities to meet potential payment and funding obligations, and we evaluate our liquidity on factors that include the levels of cash and highly liquid assets relative to our liabilities, the quality and maturities of our investment securities, the ratio of loans to deposits and any reliance on brokered certificates of deposit or other wholesale funding sources.\nWe seek to maintain a diverse and high quality loan portfolio and evaluate our asset quality on factors that include the allocation of our loans among loan types, credit exposure to any single borrower or industry type, non-performing assets as a percentage of total loans and OREO, and loan charge-offs as a percentage of average loans. We seek to maintain our allowance for loan losses at a level adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio at each balance sheet date, and we evaluate the level of our allowance for loan losses relative to our overall loan portfolio and the level of non-performing loans and potential charge-offs.\nWe seek to fund our assets primarily using core customer deposits spread among various deposit categories, and we evaluate our deposit and funding mix on factors that include the allocation of our deposits among deposit types, the level of our non-interest bearing deposits, the ratio of our core deposits (i.e. excluding time deposits above $100,000) to our total deposits and our reliance on brokered deposits or other wholesale funding sources, such as borrowings from other banks or agencies. We seek to manage the mix, maturities and re-pricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities to maintain relative stability of our net interest rate margin in a changing interest rate environment, and we evaluate our asset-liability management using models to evaluate the changes to our net interest income under different interest rate scenarios.\nFinally, we seek to maintain adequate capital levels to absorb unforeseen operating losses and to help support the growth of our balance sheet. We evaluate our capital adequacy using the regulatory and financial capital ratios including leverage capital ratio, tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, total risk-based capital ratio, tangible common equity to tangible assets and tier 1 common capital to total risk-weighted assets.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and follow general practices within the industries in which we operate. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d included in financial statements included Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nOur critical accounting estimates are summarized below. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) the accounting estimate requires management to make particularly difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and (2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or the use of different estimates that management could have reasonably used in the current period, would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, results of operations or liquidity.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses creates an allowance for loan losses known and inherent in the loan portfolio at each balance sheet date. The allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio.\nWe perform a quarterly assessment of the risks inherent in our loan portfolio, as well as a detailed review of each significant loan with identified weaknesses. Based on this analysis, we record a provision for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at appropriate levels. In determining the allowance for loan losses, we estimate losses on specific loans, or groups of loans, where the probable loss can be identified and reasonably determined. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of subjective measurements, including management's assessment of the internal risk classifications of loans, historical loan loss rates, changes in the nature of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality, industry concentrations, delinquency trends and the impact of current local, regional and national economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio. Changes in these estimates and assumptions are possible and may have a material impact on our allowance, and therefore our consolidated financial statements or results of operations. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at an amount we believe is sufficient to provide for estimated losses inherent in our loan portfolio at each balance sheet date, and fluctuations in the provision for loan losses result from management's assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Management monitors qualitative and quantitative trends in the loan portfolio, including changes in the levels of past due, internally classified and non-performing loans. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d for a description of the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses. A discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included herein under the heading -Financial Condition-Allowance for Loan Losses.\u201d See also Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors-Risks Relating to the Market and Our Business.\u201d\nGoodwill\nThe excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets from acquisitions, or goodwill, is evaluated for impairment at least annually and on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is likely impairment has occurred. In any given year, the Company may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is in excess of its carrying value. If it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of the carrying value, or if the Company elects to bypass the qualitative assessment, a two-step quantitative impairment test is performed. In performing a quantitative test for impairment, the fair value of net assets is estimated based on an analysis of our market value, discounted cash flows and peer values. Determining the fair value of goodwill is considered a critical accounting estimate because of its sensitivity to market-based economics. In addition, any allocation of the fair value of goodwill to assets and liabilities requires significant management judgment and the use of subjective measurements. Variability in market conditions and key assumptions or subjective measurements used to estimate and allocate fair value are reasonably possible and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations.\nOur annual goodwill impairment test is performed each year as of July 1st. Upon completion of this year's test, the estimated fair value of net assets was greater than carrying value of the Company. We will continue to monitor our performance and evaluate our goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently as needed.\nFor additional information regarding goodwill, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report and Risk Factors-Risks Relating to the Market and Our Business,\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\nFair Values of Loans Acquired in Business Combinations\nLoans acquired in business combinations are initially recorded at fair value with no carryover of the related allowance for credit losses. Determining the fair value of the loans involves estimating the amount and timing of principal and interest cash flows initially expected to be collected on the loans and discounting those cash flows at an appropriate market rate of interest. Going forward, the Company continues to evaluate reasonableness of expectations for the timing and the amount of cash to be collected. Subsequent decreases in expected cash flows may result in changes in the amortization or accretion of fair market value adjustments, and in some cases may result in the loan being considered impaired. For collateral dependent loans with deteriorated credit quality, the Company estimates the fair value of the underlying collateral of the loans. These values are discounted using market derived rates of return, with consideration given to the period of time and costs associated with the foreclosure and disposition of the collateral.\nFor additional information regarding acquired loans, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Acquisitions\u201d and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Loans,\u201d included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion of our results of operations compares the years ended December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2014 and the years ended December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2013.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income, the largest source of our operating income, is derived from interest, dividends and fees received on interest earning assets, less interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities. Interest earning assets primarily include loans and investment securities. Interest bearing liabilities include deposits and various forms of indebtedness. Net interest income is affected by the level of interest rates, changes in interest rates and changes in the composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities.\nThe most significant impact on our net interest income between periods is derived from the interaction of changes in the volume of and rates earned or paid on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. The volume of loans, investment\nsecurities and other interest earning assets, compared to the volume of interest bearing deposits and indebtedness, combined with the interest rate spread, produces changes in the net interest income between periods.\nThe following table presents, for the periods indicated, condensed average balance sheet information, together with interest income and yields earned on average interest earning assets and interest expense and rates paid on average interest bearing liabilities.\nAverage Balance Sheets, Yields and Rates\n(Dollars in thousands)\n\n (1) Average loan balances include non-accrual loans. Interest income on loans includes amortization of deferred loan fees net of deferred loan costs, which is not material. \n (2) Interest income and average rates for tax exempt loans and securities are presented on a fully taxable equivalent, or FTE, basis. \n (3) Includes interest on federal funds purchased and other borrowed funds. Excludes long-term debt. \n (4) Net FTE interest margin during the period equals (i) the difference between interest income on interest earning assets and the interest expense on interest bearing liabilities, divided by (ii) average interest earning assets for the period. \n (5) Cost of funds including non-interest bearing demand deposits equals (i) interest expense on interest bearing liabilities, divided by (ii) the sum of average interest bearing liabilities and average non-interest bearing demand deposits. \nDuring 2015, deposit growth combined with corresponding increases in interest earning assets and a 3 basis point reduction in our funding costs resulted in an increase in our net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent, or FTE, basis. Our FTE net interest income increased $15.9 million, or 6.3%, to $268.7 million in 2015, compared to $252.8 million in 2014. Interest accretion related to the fair valuation of acquired loans contributed $5.4 million of interest income during 2015, $1.5 million of which was the result of early loan pay-offs. Net FTE interest income was also positively impacted by recoveries of previously charged-off interest of $2.1 million in 2015, as compared to $3.6 million in 2014. Despite increases in our net FTE interest income, our net interest margin ratio decreased 3 basis points to 3.46% in 2015, compared to 3.49% in 2014. Declines in yields earned on the Company's loan and investment portfolios were partially offset by increases in average interest earning assets, primarily loans and investment securities, and reductions in funding costs. Exclusive of the accelerated interest accretion related to early payoffs of acquired loans and the impact of recoveries of charged-off interest, our net interest margin ratio was 3.40% during 2015 and 3.43% during 2014.\nDuring 2014, our FTE net interest income increased $11.3 million, or 4.7%, to $252.8 million in 2014, compared to $241.5 million in 2013, primarily due to deposit growth combined with corresponding increases in interest earning assets and a 5 basis point reduction in our funding costs. Interest accretion related to the fair valuation of acquired loans contributed $2.6 million of interest income during 2014, $1.0 million of which was the result of early loan pay-offs. Net FTE interest income was also positively impacted by recoveries of previously charged-off interest of $3.6 million in 2014, as compared to $1.4 million in 2013. Despite increases in our net FTE interest income, our net interest margin ratio decreased 5 basis points to 3.49% in 2014, compared to 3.54% in 2013. Declines in yields earned on the Company's loan and investment portfolios were partially offset by increases in average outstanding loans and reductions in funding costs. Exclusive of the accelerated interest accretion related to early payoffs of acquired loans and the impact of recoveries of charged-off interest, our net interest margin ratio was 3.43% during 2014 and 3.52% during 2013.\nThe table below sets forth, for the periods indicated, a summary of the changes in interest income and interest expense resulting from estimated changes in average asset and liability balances (volume) and estimated changes in average interest rates (rate). Changes which are not due solely to volume or rate have been allocated to these categories based on the respective percent changes in average volume and average rate as they compare to each other.\n\n (1) Interest income and average rates for tax exempt loans and securities are presented on a FTE basis. \nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses supports the allowance for loan losses known and inherent in the loan portfolio at each balance sheet date. We perform a quarterly assessment of the risks inherent in our loan portfolio, as well as a detailed review of each significant loan with identified weaknesses. Based on this analysis, we record a provision for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at appropriate levels. In determining the allowance for loan losses, we estimate losses on specific loans, or groups of loans, where the probable loss can be identified and reasonably determined. The balance of the allowance for loan losses is based on internally assigned risk classifications of loans, historical loan loss rates, changes in the nature of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality, industry concentrations, delinquency trends, current economic factors and the estimated impact of current economic conditions on certain historical loan loss rates. Fluctuations in the provision for loan losses result from management's assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Ultimate loan losses may vary from current estimates. For additional information concerning the provision for loan losses, see -Critical Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies\u201d included herein.\nFluctuations in the provision for loan losses reflect management's estimate of possible loan losses based upon evaluation of the borrowers' ability to repay, collateral value underlying loans, loan loss trends and estimated effects of current economic conditions on our loan portfolio. During 2015, we recorded a provision for loan losses of $6.8 million, as compared to a reversal of provision for loan losses of $6.6 million in 2014. The provision for loan losses recorded in 2015 was attributable to increases in specific reserves on impaired loans and loan growth.\nDuring 2014, reductions in specific reserves on impaired loans and lower general reserves reflective of continued improvement in economic conditions in our market areas, combined with improvement in loss history trends used to estimate required reserves and decreases in the level of criticized real estate and construction loans, which typically require higher reserves based on loss history, resulted in a $6.6 million reversal of provision for loan losses. During 2013, declining levels of non-performing assets and criticized loans indicative of improvement in and stabilization of our credit quality, combined with our assessment of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses resulted in a reversal of provision for loan losses of $6.1 million. For additional information concerning non-performing assets, see -Financial Condition-Non-Performing Assets\u201d herein.\nNon-interest Income\nOur principal sources of non-interest income include other service charges, commissions and fees; income from the origination and sale of loans; wealth management revenues; and, service charges on deposit accounts. Non-interest income increased $9.5 million, or 8.6%, to $120.9 million in 2015 as compared to $111.4 million in 2014, and decreased $278 thousand, or less than 1.0%, to $111.4 million in 2014, as compared to $111.7 million in 2013. Significant components of these fluctuations are discussed below.\nOther service charges, commissions and fees primarily include debit and credit card interchange income, mortgage servicing fees, insurance and other commissions and ATM service charge revenues. Other service charges, commissions and fees increased $2.4 million, or 5.9%, to $43.2 million in 2015 as compared to $40.7 million in 2014, and increased $4.8 million, or 13.2%, to $40.7 million in 2014 as compared to $36.0 million in 2013, primarily due to increases in interchange revenue due to higher credit and debit card transaction volumes and increases in mortgage loan servicing fee income resulting from an increase in the number of loans serviced.\nIncome from the origination and sale of loans includes origination and processing fees on residential real estate loans held for sale and gains on residential real estate loans sold to third parties. Fluctuations in market interest rates have a significant impact on revenues generated from the origination and sale of loans. Higher interest rates can reduce the demand for home loans and loans to refinance existing mortgages. Conversely, lower interest rates generally stimulate refinancing and home loan origination. Income from the origination and sale of loans increased $6.0 million, or 25.2%, to $30.0 million during 2015, as compared to $23.9 million during 2014. Our mortgage loan production volume increased 25% during 2015, as compared to 2014. Loans originated for home purchases accounted for approximately 66% of our 2015 production, as compared to 75% in 2014 and 54% in 2013.\nIncome from the origination and sale of loans decreased $10.3 million, or 30.1%, to $23.9 million during 2014, as compared to $34.3 million during 2013, due to the combined impacts of lower demand for refinancing loans in our market areas and increased retention of select mortgage loan production in our residential real estate loan portfolio.\nWealth management revenues are principally comprised of fees earned for management of trust assets and investment services revenues. Wealth management revenues increased $911 thousand, or 4.8%, to $19.9 million in 2015, as compared to $19.0 million in 2014, and increased $1.9 million, or 11.2%, to $19.0 million in 2014, as compared to $17.1 million in 2013, primarily due to the addition of new wealth management customers and increases in the market values of new and existing assets under management.\nOther income primarily includes company-owned life insurance revenues, net gains or losses on securities held under deferred compensation plans, check printing income, agency stock dividends and gains on sales of miscellaneous assets. Other income decreased $368 thousand, or 3.3%, to $10.7 million in 2015, as compared to $11.1 million in 2014. During 2015, other income included a one-time gain of $863 thousand on the sale of land and the reversal of a $1.0 million expense accrual due to final settlement of secondary investor claims assumed as part of the Mountain West Financial Corp., or MWFC, acquisition. In addition, income from life insurance policies increased $571 thousand in 2015, as compared to 2014. When comparing 2015 to 2014, increases in other income in 2015 were more than offset by significant one-time other income items recorded in 2014. During 2014, other income included one-time net gains of $1.2 million related to the sale of two FIB bank buildings and insurance death benefits of $921 thousand. Also contributing to the decrease in other income in 2015, as compared to 2014, were decreases of $1.0 million in earnings on securities held under deferred compensation plans.\nOther income increased $3.6 million, or 47.4%, to $11.1 million in 2014, as compared to $7.5 million in 2013. Income from life insurance increased $2.2 million in 2014, as compared to 2013, due to a full year of earnings on $60.0 million of life insurance purchased in December 2013 and January 2014, additional earnings on $13 million of company-owned life insurance acquired in the MWFC acquisition and the receipt of death benefits of $921. In addition, during fourth quarter 2014, we recorded net gains of $1.2 million related to the sale of two FIB bank buildings and received a $616 thousand volume bonus from our card payment network. These increases in other income in 2014, as compared to 2013, were partially offset by a decrease of $911 thousand in earnings on securities held under deferred compensation plans.\nNon-interest Expense\nNon-interest expense increased $11.1 million, or 4.7%, to $248.0 million in 2015, as compared to $236.9 million in 2014, and increased $14.8 million, or 6.7%, to $236.9 million in 2014, from $222.1 million in 2013. Non-interest expense for 2015 and 2014 includes $5.8 million and $8.0 million, respectively, of acquisition and loss contingency expenses. Exclusive of these acquisition and loss contingency expenses, non-interest expense increased $13.3 million, or 5.8%, to $242.2 million in 2015 as compared to $228.9 million 2014, and increased $6.8 million, or 3.1%, to $228.9 million in 2014, as compared to $222.1 in 2013. Significant components of these increases are discussed in more detail below.\nSalaries and wages increased $4.9 million, or 5.1%, to $101.5 million in 2015, from $96.5 million in 2014, primarily due to increased personnel costs associated with the MWFC acquisition in July 2014 and the Absarokee acquisition in July 2015, inflationary wage increases and higher commissions paid to mortgage loan originators due to higher loan production volumes. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $1.5 million in incentive bonus accruals reflective of our 2015 performance against our 2015 performance targets.\nSalaries and wages increased $2.5 million, or 2.7%, to $96.5 million in 2014, from $94.0 million in 2013, primarily due to increased personnel costs associated with the MWFC acquisition and inflationary wage increases. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $2.8 million in incentive bonus accruals reflective of the addition of new performance metrics and changes in the weighting of metrics used in determining incentives payable under our short-term incentive program.\nEmployee benefits increased $608 thousand, or 2.0%, to $30.7 million in 2015, as compared to $30.1 million in 2014, primarily due to the increases in group health insurance expense reflective of higher claims experience in 2015 and increased benefits costs resulting from the MWFC acquisition in July 2014 and the Absarokee acquisition in July 2015. These increases were partially offset by lower earnings on securities held under deferred compensation plans. Employee benefits decreased $208 thousand, or less than 1.0%, to $30.1 million in 2014, as compared to $30.3 million in 2013, primarily due to lower earnings on securities held under deferred compensation plans, which were partially offset by higher payroll taxes.\nFurniture and equipment expense increased $1.7 million, or 12.4%, to $15.5 million in 2015, as compared to $13.8 million in 2014, primarily due to costs associated with the implementation of new software systems placed into service during the last half of 2014, the continued upgrade of systems during 2015 and increased maintenance costs resulting from the MWFC acquisition in July 2014 and the Absarokee acquisition in July 2015. Furniture and equipment expense increased $1.3 million, or 10.1%, to $13.8 million in 2014, as compared to $12.6 million in 2013, primarily due to the addition of facilities in conjunction with the acquisition of MWFC and additional software costs associated with the implementation of new systems to assist in accounting for acquired loans, processing mortgage loans and automating certain reconciliation functions.\nOREO expense is recorded net of OREO income. Variations in net OREO expense between periods are primarily due to fluctuations in write-downs of the estimated fair value of properties, net gains and losses recorded on the sale of properties and carrying costs and/or operating expenses and income. Net OREO income increased $1.2 million, or 442.3%, to $1.5 million in 2015, as compared to $272 thousand in 2014, primarily due to higher net gains recorded on the sale of properties. During 2015, we recorded net gains of $3.0 million, as compared to net gains of $1.8 million in 2014.\nDuring 2014, we recorded net OREO income of $272 thousand, as compared to net OREO expense of $2.3 million in 2013. During 2014, we recorded gains on the sale of properties of $1.8 million, wrote-down the fair value of properties by $224 thousand and recorded net operating expenses of $1.4 million. This compares to net gains of $3.2 million, write-downs of $3.5 million and net operating expenses of $2.0 million in 2013.\nProfessional fees increased $1.6 million, or 32.3%, to $6.5 million in 2015, as compared to $4.9 million in 2014. During 2015, we incurred professional fees in conjunction with identifying and executing strategies for revenue enhancement and changing our wealth management data platform. Professional fees increased $109 thousand, or 2.3%, to $4.9 million in 2014, as compared to $4.8 million in 2013.\nCore deposit intangibles represent the intangible value of depositor relationships resulting from deposit liabilities assumed and are amortized based on the estimated useful lives of the related deposits. Core deposit intangibles amortization expense increased $1.1 million, or 50.5%, to $3.4 million in 2015, as compared to $2.3 million in 2014 due to additional amortization of core deposit intangibles recorded in conjunction with recent acquisitions. Core deposit intangible assets of $11 million recorded in conjunction with the MWFC acquisition in July 2014 and $695 thousand recorded in conjunction with the Absarokee acquisition in July 2015, are are being amortized using an accelerated method over the estimated useful lives of the related deposits of ten years. Core deposit intangible amortization expense increased $833 thousand, or 58.7%, to $2.3 million during 2014, as compared to $1.4 million during 2013 due to the amortization of core deposit intangible assets associated with the MWFC acquisition.\nOther expenses primarily include advertising and public relations costs; office supply, postage, freight, telephone and travel expenses; donations expense; debit and credit card expenses; board of director fees; legal expenses; and, other losses. Other expenses increased $3.5 million, or 7.3%, to $50.9 million in 2015, as compared to $47.5 million in 2014. During 2015, the Company recorded write-downs aggregating $806 thousand in the fair value of two vacated bank buildings held for sale; recorded a one-time contract termination fee of $876 thousand related to a change in payment service provider; and incurred an additional legal expense of approximately $1.0 million in conjunction with legal settlements reached in 2015. In addition, the Company recorded fraud losses of $1.7 million in 2015, as compared to $1.2 million in 2014, due to unusually high fraudulent credit card activity during the first half of 2015. The remaining increase in other expense in 2015, as compared to 2014, is reflective of additional operating expenses resulting from the MWFC acquisition in July 2014 and the Absarokee acquisition in July 2015. Other expenses increased $4.2 million, or 9.6%, to $47.5 million in 2014, as compared to $43.3 million in 2013, primarily due to additional expenses associated with the acquisition of MWFC.\nDuring 2015 and 2014, we recorded loss contingency expense of $5.0 million and $4.0 million, respectively related to a legal and settlement costs associated with a lender liability lawsuit against FIB. The lawsuit was settled in 2015. For additional information regarding this pending litigation, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nDuring 2015 and 2014, we recorded $795 thousand and $4.0 million of acquisition expenses related to the Absarokee acquisition in July 2015 and MWFC acquisition in July 2014, respectively. Acquisition expenses primarily include legal and professional fees, employee retention payments and travel expenses. For additional information regarding the acquisition, see \"Recent Developments\" included herein and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Acquisitions,\u201d included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur effective federal tax rate was 29.0% for the year ended December 31, 2015, 30.7% for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 30.8% for the year ended December 31, 2013. Decreases in effective federal income tax rates are primarily due to higher levels of federal tax credits resulting from our increased participation in the New Markets Tax Credits Program. For additional information about our participation in the New Markets Tax Credits Program, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nState income tax applies primarily to pretax earnings generated within Montana and South Dakota. Our effective state tax rate was 4.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015, 4.2% for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 4.3% for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nNet Income\nNet income was $86.8 million, or $1.90 per diluted share, in 2015, compared to $84.4 million, or $1.87 per diluted share, in 2014 and $86.1 million, or $1.96 per diluted share, in 2013.\nSummary of Quarterly Results\nThe following table presents unaudited quarterly results of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. \nQuarterly Results (continued)\n(Dollars in thousands except per share data)\n\nFinancial Condition\nTotal assets increased $118 million, or 1.4%, to $8,728 million as of December 31, 2015, from $8,610 million as of December 31, 2014, with $75 million of the increase attributable to the Absarokee acquisition. During 2015, deposit growth combined with proceeds from maturities and paydowns of investment securities were used to fund loan growth. Total assets increased $1,045 million, or 13.8%, to $8,610 as of December 31, 2014, from $7,565 as of December 31, 2013, with approximately $612 million of the increase attributable to the MWFC acquisition. Exclusive of the acquired MWFC assets, total assets increased $433 million, or 5.7%, compared to December 31, 2013, primarily due to organic deposit growth which was used to fund increases in interest earning assets.\nLoans\nOur loan portfolio consists of a mix of real estate, consumer, commercial, agricultural and other loans, including fixed and variable rate loans. Fluctuations in the loan portfolio are directly related to the economies of the communities we serve. While each loan originated generally must meet minimum underwriting standards established in our credit policies, lending officers are granted certain levels of authority in approving and pricing loans to assure that the banking offices are responsive to competitive issues and community needs in each market area. For additional information regarding our underwriting standards and loan approval policies, see \"Community Banking-Lending Activities\", included in Part I, Item I of this report.\nTotal loans increased $349 million, or 7.1%, to $5,246 million as of December 31, 2015, from $4,897 million as of December 31, 2014, with all major categories of loans, except agricultural real estate loans, showing growth. Approximately $37 million of the increase in total loans in 2015, as compared to 2014, was attributable to the Absarokee acquisition. Total loans increased $553 million, or 12.7%, to $4,897 million as of December 31, 2014, from $4,345 million as of December 31, 2013, with approximately $360 million of the increase attributable to the MWFC acquisition. Exclusive of the acquired MWFC loans, total loans increased $193 million, or 4.4%, compared to December 31, 2013, with the most notable organic growth occurring in residential real estate and consumer loans.\nThe following table presents the composition of our loan portfolio as of the dates indicated:\n\nReal Estate Loans. We provide interim construction and permanent financing for both single-family and multi-unit properties, medium-term loans for commercial, agricultural and industrial property and/or buildings and equity lines of credit secured by real estate.\nCommercial real estate loans. Commercial real estate loans include loans for property and improvements used commercially by the borrower or for lease to others for the production of goods or services. Approximately 50% and 51% of our commercial real estate loans were owner occupied as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Commercial real estate loans increased $154 million, or 9.4%, to $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2015, from $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2014, with approximately $12 million of the increase attributable to the Absarokee acquisition. Management attributes the remaining organic growth in commercial real estate loans to continuing business expansion in our market areas and the movement of completed commercial construction projects from construction loans to permanent financing.\nCommercial real estate loans increased $190 million, or 13.1%, to $1,639 million as of December 31, 2014, from $1,449 million as of December 31, 2013. Exclusive of the MWFC acquired loans, commercial real estate loans decreased $25 million, or 1.7%, from December 31, 2013, primarily due to soft loan demand combined with the movement of loans out of the portfolio through charge-off, pay-off and foreclosure.\nConstruction loans. Construction loans are primarily to commercial builders for residential lot development and the construction of single-family residences and commercial real estate properties. Construction loans are generally underwritten pursuant to pre-approved permanent financing. During the construction phase the borrower pays interest only. As of December 31, 2015, our construction loan portfolio was divided among the following categories: approximately $112 million, or 26%, residential construction; approximately $95 million, or 22%, commercial construction; and, approximately $224 million, or 52%, land acquisition and development. This compares to approximately $97 million, or 23%, residential construction; approximately $101 million, or 24%, commercial construction; and, approximately $220 million, or 53%, land acquisition and development as of December 31, 2014.\nConstruction loans grew organically $12 million, or 3.0%, to $431 million as of December 31, 2015, from $418 million as of December 31, 2014. Exclusive of the of the MWFC acquired loans, construction loans increased $37 million, or 10.4%, from December 31, 2013. Management attributes organic growth in construction loans to continuing increased housing demand in our market areas during 2015 and 2014.\nResidential real estate loans. Retained residential real estate loans are typically secured by first liens on the financed property and generally mature in less than fifteen years. Included in residential real estate loans were home equity loans and lines of credit of $299 million as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Residential real estate loans increased $33 million, or 3.3%, to $1,033 million as of December 31, 2015, from $1,000 million as of December 31, 2014, primarily due to continued increased housing demand in our market areas. Residential real estate loans grew $132 million, or 15.2%, to $1,000 million as of December 31, 2014, from $868 million as of December 31, 2013, with approximately $48 million of the increase attributable to the MWFC acquisition. Exclusive of the MWFC acquired loans, residential real estate loans grew $84 million, or 9.6%, from December 31, 2013, due to higher retention of residential loans in our portfolio combined with increased housing demand in our market areas.\nConsumer Loans. Our consumer loans include direct personal loans; credit card loans and lines of credit; and, indirect loans created when we purchase consumer loan contracts advanced for the purchase of automobiles, boats and other consumer goods from the consumer product dealer network within the market areas we serve. Personal loans and indirect dealer loans are generally secured by automobiles, recreational vehicles, boats and other types of personal property and are made on an installment basis. Credit cards are offered to customers in our market areas. Lines of credit are generally floating rate loans that are unsecured or secured by", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

As of December 31, 2015, we had consolidated assets of $8.7 billion, deposits of $7.1 billion, loans of $5.2 billion and total stockholders' equity of $950 million.\nWe currently operate 79 banking offices, including detached drive-up facilities, in 45 communities located in Montana, Wyoming and South Dakota. We also offer internet and mobile banking services. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, FIB, we deliver a comprehensive range of banking products and services to individuals, businesses, municipalities and other entities throughout our market areas. Our customers participate in a wide variety of industries, including energy, healthcare and professional services, education and governmental services, construction, mining, agriculture, retail and wholesale trade and tourism.\nOur Business\nOur principal business activity is lending to, accepting deposits from and conducting financial transactions for individuals, businesses, municipalities and other entities. We derive our income principally from interest charged on loans and, to a lesser extent, from interest and dividends earned on investments. We also derive income from non-interest sources such as fees received in connection with various lending and deposit services; trust, employee benefit, investment and insurance services; mortgage loan originations, sales and servicing; merchant and electronic banking services; and from time to time, gains on sales of assets. Our principal expenses include interest expense on deposits and borrowings, operating expenses, provisions for loan losses and income tax expense.\nOur loan portfolio consists of a mix of real estate, consumer, commercial, agricultural and other loans, including fixed and variable rate loans. Our real estate loans comprise commercial real estate, construction (including residential, commercial and land development loans), residential, agricultural and other real estate loans. Fluctuations in the loan portfolio are directly related to the economies of the communities we serve. While each loan originated generally must meet minimum underwriting standards established in our credit policies, lending officers are granted discretion within pre-approved limits in approving and pricing loans to assure that the banking offices are responsive to competitive issues and community needs in each market area. We fund our loan portfolio primarily with the core deposits from our customers, generally without utilizing brokered deposits and with minimal reliance on wholesale funding sources. For additional information about our underwriting standards and loan approval process, see \"Business-Lending Activities,\" included in Part I, Item 1 of this report.\nRecent Trends and Developments\nOn July 24, 2015, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Absarokee Bancorporation, Inc., or Absarokee, a Montana-based bank holding company operating one wholly-owned subsidiary bank, United Bank, with branches located in three Montana communities adjacent to the Company's existing market areas. United Bank was merged with FIB immediately subsequent to the acquisition. We paid cash consideration for the acquisition of $7.2 million. As of the acquisition date, Absarokee had total assets of $75 million, loans of $37 million and deposits of $64 million. For additional information regarding the acquisition, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Acquisition,\u201d included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nOn July 2, 2013, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank issued a final rule implementing a revised regulatory capital framework for U.S. banks in accordance with the Basel III international accord. The revised regulatory capital framework, or Basel III, became effective for us on January 1, 2015. Basel III includes a more stringent definition of capital and introduces a new common equity tier 1, or CET1, capital requirement, sets forth a comprehensive methodology for calculating risk-weighted assets, introduces a conservation buffer and sets out minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards. Certain deductions and adjustments to regulatory capital phase in starting January 1, 2015 and will be fully implemented on January 1, 2018. The capital conservation buffer phases in beginning January 1, 2016 and will be fully\nimplemented on January 1, 2019. As of December 31, 2015, we had capital levels that, in all cases, exceeded the well-capitalized guidelines. For additional information regarding our capital levels, see \"Capital Resources and Liquidity Management\" included herein and Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements-Regulatory Capital,\u201d included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nPrimary Factors Used in Evaluating Our Business\nAs a banking institution, we manage and evaluate various aspects of both our financial condition and our results of operations. We monitor our financial condition and performance and evaluate the levels and trends of the line items included in our balance sheet and statements of income, as well as various financial ratios that are commonly used in our industry. We analyze these ratios and financial trends against both our own historical levels and the financial condition and performance of comparable banking institutions in our region and nationally.\nResults of Operations\nPrincipal factors used in managing and evaluating our results of operations include return on average assets, net interest income, non-interest income, non-interest expense and net income. Net interest income is affected by the level of interest rates, changes in interest rates and changes in the volume and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. The most significant impact on our net interest income between periods is derived from the interaction of changes in the rates earned or paid on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, which we refer to as interest rate spread. The volume of loans, investment securities and other interest earning assets, compared to the volume of interest bearing deposits and indebtedness, combined with the interest rate spread, produces changes in our net interest income between periods. Non-interest bearing sources of funds, such as demand deposits and stockholders' equity, also support earning assets.\nThe impact of free funding sources is captured in the net interest margin, which is calculated as net interest income divided by average earning assets. We evaluate our net interest income on factors that include the yields on our loans and other earning assets, the costs of our deposits and other funding sources, the levels of our net interest spread and net interest margin.\nWe seek to increase our non-interest income over time and we evaluate our non-interest income relative to the trends of the individual types of non-interest income in view of prevailing market conditions.\nWe manage our non-interest expenses in consideration of growth opportunities and our community banking model that emphasizes customer service and responsiveness. We evaluate our non-interest expense on factors that include our non-interest expense relative to our average assets, our efficiency ratio and the trends of the individual categories of non-interest expense.\nFinally, we seek to increase our net income and provide favorable shareholder returns over time, and we evaluate our net income relative to the performance of other bank holding companies on factors that include return on average assets, return on average equity, total shareholder return and growth in earnings.\nFinancial Condition\nPrincipal areas of focus in managing and evaluating our financial condition include liquidity, the diversification and quality of our loans, the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, the diversification and terms of our deposits and other funding sources, the re-pricing characteristics and maturities of our assets and liabilities, including potential interest rate exposure and the adequacy of our capital levels. We seek to maintain sufficient levels of cash and investment securities to meet potential payment and funding obligations, and we evaluate our liquidity on factors that include the levels of cash and highly liquid assets relative to our liabilities, the quality and maturities of our investment securities, the ratio of loans to deposits and any reliance on brokered certificates of deposit or other wholesale funding sources.\nWe seek to maintain a diverse and high quality loan portfolio and evaluate our asset quality on factors that include the allocation of our loans among loan types, credit exposure to any single borrower or industry type, non-performing assets as a percentage of total loans and OREO, and loan charge-offs as a percentage of average loans. We seek to maintain our allowance for loan losses at a level adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio at each balance sheet date, and we evaluate the level of our allowance for loan losses relative to our overall loan portfolio and the level of non-performing loans and potential charge-offs.\nWe seek to fund our assets primarily using core customer deposits spread among various deposit categories, and we evaluate our deposit and funding mix on factors that include the allocation of our deposits among deposit types, the level of our non-interest bearing deposits, the ratio of our core deposits (i.e. excluding time deposits above $100,000) to our total deposits and our reliance on brokered deposits or other wholesale funding sources, such as borrowings from other banks or agencies. We seek to manage the mix, maturities and re-pricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities to maintain relative stability of our net interest rate margin in a changing interest rate environment, and we evaluate our asset-liability management using models to evaluate the changes to our net interest income under different interest rate scenarios.\nFinally, we seek to maintain adequate capital levels to absorb unforeseen operating losses and to help support the growth of our balance sheet. We evaluate our capital adequacy using the regulatory and financial capital ratios including leverage capital ratio, tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, total risk-based capital ratio, tangible common equity to tangible assets and tier 1 common capital to total risk-weighted assets.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and follow general practices within the industries in which we operate. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d included in financial statements included Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nOur critical accounting estimates are summarized below. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) the accounting estimate requires management to make particularly difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and (2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or the use of different estimates that management could have reasonably used in the current period, would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, results of operations or liquidity.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses creates an allowance for loan losses known and inherent in the loan portfolio at each balance sheet date. The allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio.\nWe perform a quarterly assessment of the risks inherent in our loan portfolio, as well as a detailed review of each significant loan with identified weaknesses. Based on this analysis, we record a provision for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at appropriate levels. In determining the allowance for loan losses, we estimate losses on specific loans, or groups of loans, where the probable loss can be identified and reasonably determined. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of subjective measurements, including management's assessment of the internal risk classifications of loans, historical loan loss rates, changes in the nature of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality, industry concentrations, delinquency trends and the impact of current local, regional and national economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio. Changes in these estimates and assumptions are possible and may have a material impact on our allowance, and therefore our consolidated financial statements or results of operations. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at an amount we believe is sufficient to provide for estimated losses inherent in our loan portfolio at each balance sheet date, and fluctuations in the provision for loan losses result from management's assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Management monitors qualitative and quantitative trends in the loan portfolio, including changes in the levels of past due, internally classified and non-performing loans. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d for a description of the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses. A discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included herein under the heading -Financial Condition-Allowance for Loan Losses.\u201d See also Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors-Risks Relating to the Market and Our Business.\u201d\nGoodwill\nThe excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets from acquisitions, or goodwill, is evaluated for impairment at least annually and on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is likely impairment has occurred. In any given year, the Company may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is in excess of its carrying value. If it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of the carrying value, or if the Company elects to bypass the qualitative assessment, a two-step quantitative impairment test is performed. In performing a quantitative test for impairment, the fair value of net assets is estimated based on an analysis of our market value, discounted cash flows and peer values. Determining the fair value of goodwill is considered a critical accounting estimate because of its sensitivity to market-based economics. In addition, any allocation of the fair value of goodwill to assets and liabilities requires significant management judgment and the use of subjective measurements. Variability in market conditions and key assumptions or subjective measurements used to estimate and allocate fair value are reasonably possible and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations.\nOur annual goodwill impairment test is performed each year as of July 1st. Upon completion of this year's test, the estimated fair value of net assets was greater than carrying value of the Company. We will continue to monitor our performance and evaluate our goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently as needed.\nFor additional information regarding goodwill, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report and Risk Factors-Risks Relating to the Market and Our Business,\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\nFair Values of Loans Acquired in Business Combinations\nLoans acquired in business combinations are initially recorded at fair value with no carryover of the related allowance for credit losses. Determining the fair value of the loans involves estimating the amount and timing of principal and interest cash flows initially expected to be collected on the loans and discounting those cash flows at an appropriate market rate of interest. Going forward, the Company continues to evaluate reasonableness of expectations for the timing and the amount of cash to be collected. Subsequent decreases in expected cash flows may result in changes in the amortization or accretion of fair market value adjustments, and in some cases may result in the loan being considered impaired. For collateral dependent loans with deteriorated credit quality, the Company estimates the fair value of the underlying collateral of the loans. These values are discounted using market derived rates of return, with consideration given to the period of time and costs associated with the foreclosure and disposition of the collateral.\nFor additional information regarding acquired loans, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Acquisitions\u201d and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Loans,\u201d included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion of our results of operations compares the years ended December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2014 and the years ended December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2013.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income, the largest source of our operating income, is derived from interest, dividends and fees received on interest earning assets, less interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities. Interest earning assets primarily include loans and investment securities. Interest bearing liabilities include deposits and various forms of indebtedness. Net interest income is affected by the level of interest rates, changes in interest rates and changes in the composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities.\nThe most significant impact on our net interest income between periods is derived from the interaction of changes in the volume of and rates earned or paid on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. The volume of loans, investment\nsecurities and other interest earning assets, compared to the volume of interest bearing deposits and indebtedness, combined with the interest rate spread, produces changes in the net interest income between periods.\nThe following table presents, for the periods indicated, condensed average balance sheet information, together with interest income and yields earned on average interest earning assets and interest expense and rates paid on average interest bearing liabilities.\nAverage Balance Sheets, Yields and Rates\n(Dollars in thousands)\nTable 93:

Our FTE net interest income increased $15.9 million, or 6.3%, to $268.7 million in 2015, compared to $252.8 million in 2014. Interest accretion related to the fair valuation of acquired loans contributed $5.4 million of interest income during 2015, $1.5 million of which was the result of early loan pay-offs. Net FTE interest income was also positively impacted by recoveries of previously charged-off interest of $2.1 million in 2015, as compared to $3.6 million in 2014. Despite increases in our net FTE interest income, our net interest margin ratio decreased 3 basis points to 3.46% in 2015, compared to 3.49% in 2014. Declines in yields earned on the Company's loan and investment portfolios were partially offset by increases in average interest earning assets, primarily loans and investment securities, and reductions in funding costs. Exclusive of the accelerated interest accretion related to early payoffs of acquired loans and the impact of recoveries of charged-off interest, our net interest margin ratio was 3.40% during 2015 and 3.43% during 2014.\nDuring 2014, our FTE net interest income increased $11.3 million, or 4.7%, to $252.8 million in 2014, compared to $241.5 million in 2013, primarily due to deposit growth combined with corresponding increases in interest earning assets and a 5 basis point reduction in our funding costs. Interest accretion related to the fair valuation of acquired loans contributed $2.6 million of interest income during 2014, $1.0 million of which was the result of early loan pay-offs. Net FTE interest income was also positively impacted by recoveries of previously charged-off interest of $3.6 million in 2014, as compared to $1.4 million in 2013. Despite increases in our net FTE interest income, our net interest margin ratio decreased 5 basis points to 3.49% in 2014, compared to 3.54% in 2013.

\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses supports the allowance for loan losses known and inherent in the loan portfolio at each balance sheet date. We perform a quarterly assessment of the risks inherent in our loan portfolio, as well as a detailed review of each significant loan with identified weaknesses. Based on this analysis, we record a provision for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at appropriate levels. In determining the allowance for loan losses, we estimate losses on specific loans, or groups of loans, where the probable loss can be identified and reasonably determined. The balance of the allowance for loan losses is based on internally assigned risk classifications of loans, historical loan loss rates, changes in the nature of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality, industry concentrations, delinquency trends, current economic factors and the estimated impact of current economic conditions on certain historical loan loss rates. Fluctuations in the provision for loan losses result from management's assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Ultimate loan losses may vary from current estimates. For additional information concerning the provision for loan losses, see -Critical Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies\u201d included herein.\nFluctuations in the provision for loan losses reflect management's estimate of possible loan losses based upon evaluation of the borrowers' ability to repay, collateral value underlying loans, loan loss trends and estimated effects of current economic conditions on our loan portfolio. During 2015, we recorded a provision for loan losses of $6.8 million, as compared to a reversal of provision for loan losses of $6.6 million in 2014. The provision for loan losses recorded in 2015 was attributable to increases in specific reserves on impaired loans and loan growth.\nDuring 2014, reductions in specific reserves on impaired loans and lower general reserves reflective of continued improvement in economic conditions in our market areas, combined with improvement in loss history trends used to estimate required reserves and decreases in the level of criticized real estate and construction loans, which typically require higher reserves based on loss history, resulted in a $6.6 million reversal of provision for loan losses. During 2013, declining levels of non-performing assets and criticized loans indicative of improvement in and stabilization of our credit quality, combined with our assessment of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses resulted in a reversal of provision for loan losses of $6.1 million. For additional information concerning non-performing assets, see -Financial Condition-Non-Performing Assets\u201d herein.\nNon-interest Income\nOur principal sources of non-interest income include other service charges, commissions and fees; income from the origination and sale of loans; wealth management revenues; and, service charges on deposit accounts. Non-interest income increased $9.5 million, or 8.6%, to $120.9 million in 2015 as compared to $111.4 million in 2014, and decreased $278 thousand, or less than 1.0%, to $111.4 million in 2014, as compared to $111.7 million in 2013. Significant components of these fluctuations are discussed below.\nOther service charges, commissions and fees primarily include debit and credit card interchange income, mortgage servicing fees, insurance and other commissions and ATM service charge revenues. Other service charges, commissions and fees increased $2.4 million, or 5.9%, to $43.2 million in 2015 as compared to $40.7 million in 2014, and increased $4.8 million, or 13.2%, to $40.7 million in 2014 as compared to $36.0 million in 2013, primarily due to increases in interchange revenue due to higher credit and debit card transaction volumes and increases in mortgage loan servicing fee income resulting from an increase in the number of loans serviced.\nIncome from the origination and sale of loans includes origination and processing fees on residential real estate loans held for sale and gains on residential real estate loans sold to third parties. Fluctuations in market interest rates have a significant impact on revenues generated from the origination and sale of loans. Higher interest rates can reduce the demand for home loans and loans to refinance existing mortgages. Conversely, lower interest rates generally stimulate refinancing and home loan origination. Income from the origination and sale of loans increased $6.0 million, or 25.2%, to $30.0 million during 2015, as compared to $23.9 million during 2014. Our mortgage loan production volume increased 25% during 2015, as compared to 2014. Loans originated for home purchases accounted for approximately 66% of our 2015 production, as compared to 75% in 2014 and 54% in 2013.\nIncome from the origination and sale of loans decreased $10.3 million, or 30.1%, to $23.9 million during 2014, as compared to $34.3 million during 2013, due to the combined impacts of lower demand for refinancing loans in our market areas and increased retention of select mortgage loan production in our residential real estate loan portfolio.\nWealth management revenues are principally comprised of fees earned for management of trust assets and investment services revenues. Wealth management revenues increased $911 thousand, or 4.8%, to $19.9 million in 2015, as compared to $19.0 million in 2014, and increased $1.9 million, or 11.2%, to $19.0 million in 2014, as compared to $17.1 million in 2013, primarily due to the addition of new wealth management customers and increases in the market values of new and existing assets under management.\nOther income primarily includes company-owned life insurance revenues, net gains or losses on securities held under deferred compensation plans, check printing income, agency stock dividends and gains on sales of miscellaneous assets. Other income decreased $368 thousand, or 3.3%, to $10.7 million in 2015, as compared to $11.1 million in 2014. During 2015, other income included a one-time gain of $863 thousand on the sale of land and the reversal of a $1.0 million expense accrual due to final settlement of secondary investor claims assumed as part of the Mountain West Financial Corp., or MWFC, acquisition. In addition, income from life insurance policies increased $571 thousand in 2015, as compared to 2014. When comparing 2015 to 2014, increases in other income in 2015 were more than offset by significant one-time other income items recorded in 2014. During 2014, other income included one-time net gains of $1.2 million related to the sale of two FIB bank buildings and insurance death benefits of $921 thousand. Also contributing to the decrease in other income in 2015, as compared to 2014, were decreases of $1.0 million in earnings on securities held under deferred compensation plans.\nOther income increased $3.6 million, or 47.4%, to $11.1 million in 2014, as compared to $7.5 million in 2013. Income from life insurance increased $2.2 million in 2014, as compared to 2013, due to a full year of earnings on $60.0 million of life insurance purchased in December 2013 and January 2014, additional earnings on $13 million of company-owned life insurance acquired in the MWFC acquisition and the receipt of death benefits of $921. In addition, during fourth quarter 2014, we recorded net gains of $1.2 million related to the sale of two FIB bank buildings and received a $616 thousand volume bonus from our card payment network. These increases in other income in 2014, as compared to 2013, were partially offset by a decrease of $911 thousand in earnings on securities held under deferred compensation plans.\nNon-interest Expense\nNon-interest expense increased $11.1 million, or 4.7%, to $248.0 million in 2015, as compared to $236.9 million in 2014, and increased $14.8 million, or 6.7%, to $236.9 million in 2014, from $222.1 million in 2013. Non-interest expense for 2015 and 2014 includes $5.8 million and $8.0 million, respectively, of acquisition and loss contingency expenses. Exclusive of these acquisition and loss contingency expenses, non-interest expense increased $13.3 million, or 5.8%, to $242.2 million in 2015 as compared to $228.9 million 2014, and increased $6.8 million, or 3.1%, to $228.9 million in 2014, as compared to $222.1 in 2013. Significant components of these increases are discussed in more detail below.\nSalaries and wages increased $4.9 million, or 5.1%, to $101.5 million in 2015, from $96.5 million in 2014, primarily due to increased personnel costs associated with the MWFC acquisition in July 2014 and the Absarokee acquisition in July 2015, inflationary wage increases and higher commissions paid to mortgage loan originators due to higher loan production volumes. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $1.5 million in incentive bonus accruals reflective of our 2015 performance against our 2015 performance targets.\nSalaries and wages increased $2.5 million, or 2.7%, to $96.5 million in 2014, from $94.0 million in 2013, primarily due to increased personnel costs associated with the MWFC acquisition and inflationary wage increases. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $2.8 million in incentive bonus accruals reflective of the addition of new performance metrics and changes in the weighting of metrics used in determining incentives payable under our short-term incentive program.\nEmployee benefits increased $608 thousand, or 2.0%, to $30.7 million in 2015, as compared to $30.1 million in 2014, primarily due to the increases in group health insurance expense reflective of higher claims experience in 2015 and increased benefits costs resulting from the MWFC acquisition in July 2014 and the Absarokee acquisition in July 2015. These increases were partially offset by lower earnings on securities held under deferred compensation plans. Employee benefits decreased $208 thousand, or less than 1.0%, to $30.1 million in 2014, as compared to $30.3 million in 2013, primarily due to lower earnings on securities held under deferred compensation plans, which were partially offset by higher payroll taxes.\nFurniture and equipment expense increased $1.7 million, or 12.4%, to $15.5 million in 2015, as compared to $13.8 million in 2014, primarily due to costs associated with the implementation of new software systems placed into service during the last half of 2014, the continued upgrade of systems during 2015 and increased maintenance costs resulting from the MWFC acquisition in July 2014 and the Absarokee acquisition in July 2015. Furniture and equipment expense increased $1.3 million, or 10.1%, to $13.8 million in 2014, as compared to $12.6 million in 2013, primarily due to the addition of facilities in conjunction with the acquisition of MWFC and additional software costs associated with the implementation of new systems to assist in accounting for acquired loans, processing mortgage loans and automating certain reconciliation functions.\nOREO expense is recorded net of OREO income. Variations in net OREO expense between periods are primarily due to fluctuations in write-downs of the estimated fair value of properties, net gains and losses recorded on the sale of properties and carrying costs and/or operating expenses and income. Net OREO income increased $1.2 million, or 442.3%, to $1.5 million in 2015, as compared to $272 thousand in 2014, primarily due to higher net gains recorded on the sale of properties. During 2015, we recorded net gains of $3.0 million, as compared to net gains of $1.8 million in 2014.\nDuring 2014, we recorded net OREO income of $272 thousand, as compared to net OREO expense of $2.3 million in 2013. During 2014, we recorded gains on the sale of properties of $1.8 million, wrote-down the fair value of properties by $224 thousand and recorded net operating expenses of $1.4 million. This compares to net gains of $3.2 million, write-downs of $3.5 million and net operating expenses of $2.0 million in 2013.\nProfessional fees increased $1.6 million, or 32.3%, to $6.5 million in 2015, as compared to $4.9 million in 2014. During 2015, we incurred professional fees in conjunction with identifying and executing strategies for revenue enhancement and changing our wealth management data platform. Professional fees increased $109 thousand, or 2.3%, to $4.9 million in 2014, as compared to $4.8 million in 2013.\nCore deposit intangibles represent the intangible value of depositor relationships resulting from deposit liabilities assumed and are amortized based on the estimated useful lives of the related deposits. Core deposit intangibles amortization expense increased $1.1 million, or 50.5%, to $3.4 million in 2015, as compared to $2.3 million in 2014 due to additional amortization of core deposit intangibles recorded in conjunction with recent acquisitions. Core deposit intangible assets of $11 million recorded in conjunction with the MWFC acquisition in July 2014 and $695 thousand recorded in conjunction with the Absarokee acquisition in July 2015, are are being amortized using an accelerated method over the estimated useful lives of the related deposits of ten years. Core deposit intangible amortization expense increased $833 thousand, or 58.7%, to $2.3 million during 2014, as compared to $1.4 million during 2013 due to the amortization of core deposit intangible assets associated with the MWFC acquisition.\nOther expenses primarily include advertising and public relations costs; office supply, postage, freight, telephone and travel expenses; donations expense; debit and credit card expenses; board of director fees; legal expenses; and, other losses. Other expenses increased $3.5 million, or 7.3%, to $50.9 million in 2015, as compared to $47.5 million in 2014. During 2015, the Company recorded write-downs aggregating $806 thousand in the fair value of two vacated bank buildings held for sale; recorded a one-time contract termination fee of $876 thousand related to a change in payment service provider; and incurred an additional legal expense of approximately $1.0 million in conjunction with legal settlements reached in 2015. In addition, the Company recorded fraud losses of $1.7 million in 2015, as compared to $1.2 million in 2014, due to unusually high fraudulent credit card activity during the first half of 2015. The remaining increase in other expense in 2015, as compared to 2014, is reflective of additional operating expenses resulting from the MWFC acquisition in July 2014 and the Absarokee acquisition in July 2015. Other expenses increased $4.2 million, or 9.6%, to $47.5 million in 2014, as compared to $43.3 million in 2013, primarily due to additional expenses associated with the acquisition of MWFC.\nDuring 2015 and 2014, we recorded loss contingency expense of $5.0 million and $4.0 million, respectively related to a legal and settlement costs associated with a lender liability lawsuit against FIB. The lawsuit was settled in 2015. For additional information regarding this pending litigation, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nDuring 2015 and 2014, we recorded $795 thousand and $4.0 million of acquisition expenses related to the Absarokee acquisition in July 2015 and MWFC acquisition in July 2014, respectively. Acquisition expenses primarily include legal and professional fees, employee retention payments and travel expenses. For additional information regarding the acquisition, see \"Recent Developments\" included herein and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Acquisitions,\u201d included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur effective federal tax rate was 29.0% for the year ended December 31, 2015, 30.7% for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 30.8% for the year ended December 31, 2013. Decreases in effective federal income tax rates are primarily due to higher levels of federal tax credits resulting from our increased participation in the New Markets Tax Credits Program. For additional information about our participation in the New Markets Tax Credits Program, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nState income tax applies primarily to pretax earnings generated within Montana and South Dakota. Our effective state tax rate was 4.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015, 4.2% for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 4.3% for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nNet Income\nNet income was $86.8 million, or $1.90 per diluted share, in 2015, compared to $84.4 million, or $1.87 per diluted share, in 2014 and $86.1 million, or $1.96 per diluted share, in 2013.\nSummary of Quarterly Results\nThe following table presents unaudited quarterly results of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.

$8,610 million as of December 31, 2014, with $75 million of the increase attributable to the Absarokee acquisition. During 2015, deposit growth combined with proceeds from maturities and paydowns of investment securities were used to fund loan growth. Total assets increased $1,045 million, or 13.8%, to $8,610 as of December 31, 2014, from $7,565 as of December 31, 2013, with approximately $612 million of the increase attributable to the MWFC acquisition. Exclusive of the acquired MWFC assets, total assets increased $433 million, or 5.7%, compared to December 31, 2013, primarily due to organic deposit growth which was used to fund increases in interest earning assets.\nLoans\nOur loan portfolio consists of a mix of real estate, consumer, commercial, agricultural and other loans, including fixed and variable rate loans. Fluctuations in the loan portfolio are directly related to the economies of the communities we serve. While each loan originated generally must meet minimum underwriting standards established in our credit policies, lending officers are granted certain levels of authority in approving and pricing loans to assure that the banking offices are responsive to competitive issues and community needs in each market area. For additional information regarding our underwriting standards and loan approval policies, see \"Community Banking-Lending Activities\", included in Part I, Item I of this report.\nTotal loans increased $349 million, or 7.1%, to $5,246 million as of December 31, 2015, from $4,897 million as of December 31, 2014, with all major categories of loans, except agricultural real estate loans, showing growth. Approximately $37 million of the increase in total loans in 2015, as compared to 2014, was attributable to the Absarokee acquisition. Total loans increased $553 million, or 12.7%, to $4,897 million as of December 31, 2014, from $4,345 million as of December 31, 2013, with approximately $360 million of the increase attributable to the MWFC acquisition. Exclusive of the acquired MWFC loans, total loans increased $193 million, or 4.4%, compared to December 31, 2013, with the most notable organic growth occurring in residential real estate and consumer loans.\nThe following table presents the composition of our loan portfolio as of the dates indicated:\nTable 103: <table><tr><td>Loans Outstanding\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td>
