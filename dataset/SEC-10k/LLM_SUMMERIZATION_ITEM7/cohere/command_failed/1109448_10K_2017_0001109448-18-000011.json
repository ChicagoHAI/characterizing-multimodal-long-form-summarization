Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nPercentage change figures are calculated using assets under management rounded to the nearest million and financial statement amounts rounded to the nearest thousand.\nExecutive Overview\nOur total assets under management ( AUM\u201d) as of December 31, 2017 were $554.5 billion, up $74.3 billion, or 15.5%, during 2017. The increase was driven by market appreciation of $61.1 billion and net inflows of $13.2 billion (primarily due to Retail and Institutional inflows of $8.9 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively).\nInstitutional AUM increased $30.0 billion, or 12.5%, to $269.3 billion during 2017, due to market appreciation of $26.4 billion and net inflows of $3.6 billion. Gross sales decreased $8.2 billion, or 38.1%, from $21.6 billion in 2016 to $13.4 billion in 2017. Redemptions and terminations decreased $4.2 billion, or 27.3%, from $15.7 billion in 2016 to $11.5 billion in 2017.\nRetail AUM increased $32.7 billion, or 20.5%, to $192.9 billion during 2017, due to market appreciation of $23.8 billion and net inflows of $8.9 billion. Gross sales increased $12.6 billion, or 30.5%, from $41.2 billion in 2016 to $53.8 billion in 2017. Redemptions and terminations decreased $2.2 billion, or 5.4%, from $40.8 billion in 2016 to $38.6 billion in 2017.\nPrivate Wealth Management AUM increased $11.6 billion, or 14.2%, to $92.3 billion during 2017, due to market appreciation of $10.9 billion and net inflows of $0.7 billion. Gross sales increased $1.3 billion, or 13.2%, from $10.2 billion in 2016 to $11.5 billion in 2017. Redemptions and terminations increased $1.3 billion, or 14.2%, from $9.3 billion in 2016 to $10.6 billion in 2017.\nBernstein Research Services revenue decreased $30.0 million, or 6.2%, in 2017. The decrease was driven by a decline in client activity in the U.S. and a volume mix shift to electronic trading in Europe. The decrease was partially offset by increased client activity in Asia and a weaker U.S. dollar year-over-year.\nOur 2017 revenues of $3.3 billion increased $0.3 billion, or 8.9%, compared to the prior year's net revenues of $3.0 billion. The most significant contributors to the increase were higher base advisory fees of $204.9 million, higher performance-based fees of $62.0 million and higher distribution revenues of $27.7 million, offset by lower Bernstein Research Services revenue of $30.0 million. Our operating expenses of $2.5 billion increased $0.2 billion, or 9.5%, compared to the prior year's expenses of $2.3 billion. The increase primarily was due to higher employee compensation and benefits of $83.7 million, higher general and administrative expenses (excluding real estate charges) of $55.3 million, higher promotion and servicing expenses of $35.4 million, lower adjustments to contingent payment arrangements of $20.5 million and higher real estate charges of $19.0 million. Our operating income increased $50.7 million, or 7.0%, to $773.9 million from $723.2 million in 2016 and our operating margin decreased from 23.2% in 2016 to 21.7% in 2017 as higher expenses outpaced revenue growth.\nMarket Environment\nGlobal equity markets increased substantially in 2017, and fixed income markets rose as well, as the global recovery gained momentum and breadth throughout the year. For the first time in the past five years, non-U.S. stocks outperformed U.S. stocks, aided by a weaker dollar, and credit spreads tightened in a risk-on\u201d environment. After an uncertain and volatile 2016, U.S. market volatility was exceptionally low in 2017. While 2018 got off to a strong start, U.S. equity markets began to vacillate wildly in February, and volatility surged as a result of a sharp rise in investor concern over the pace of interest rate hikes and the chances of rising inflation, which could slow economic growth. These stresses created uncertainty across global markets as well.\nDespite the strong run in the global markets, inflation so far remains low and Central Banks' monetary policies continue to vary among developed and emerging markets. In the U.S., three interest rate increases occurred during 2017 and several more are predicted for 2018, particularly if the economy continues to exhibit low unemployment, ongoing growth and emerging evidence of rising inflation. It remains to be seen how new tax legislation enacted in December 2017 will affect the U.S. economy going forward. In Europe, which is earlier in its economic recovery than the U.S., asset purchases by the European Central Bank are expected to end in 2018, Brexit negotiations are ongoing and MiFID II went into effect at the start of 2018. And in China, with the pace of growth slowing, quality\u201d of growth is increasing in importance.\nThe challenges for active fund managers continued in 2017. While their investment performance improved on average in 2017, they still struggled to attract net new assets in the face of ongoing overwhelming demand for passive equity strategies and accelerating demand for passive fixed income strategies. In the U.S., where the shift from active to passive has been most prevalent, total industry-wide active mutual fund flows turned positive in 2017, with $56 billion, on strength in fixed income and international equity services. Active U.S. equity mutual funds, however, still sustained $201 billion in outflows for the year,\neven though the percentage of outperforming active equity managers increased to 50%, versus 26% in 2016 and a long-term average of 34%. Meanwhile, total passive inflows continued to accelerate in 2017 and reached an all-time high of $692 billion.\nMiFID II\nThe second installment of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II ( MiFID II\u201d), which became effective January 3, 2018, makes significant modifications to the manner in which European broker-dealers can be compensated for research. These modifications are recognized in the industry as having the potential to significantly decrease the overall research spend by European buy-side firms. Consequently, our U.K.-based broker-dealer is considering new charging mechanisms for its research in order to minimize this impact as part of its broader MiFID II implementation program. It is important to note, however, that our new charging techniques and other strategic decisions to address the new environment created by MiFID II may not be successful, which could result in a significant decline in our sell-side revenues.\nAlso, although MiFID II does permit buy-side firms to purchase research through the use of client-funded research payment accounts, most buy-side firms that operate in the Eurozone, including our U.K. buy-side subsidiaries, have decided to use their own funds to pay for research in the Eurozone. This change in practice will increase our expenses in the Eurozone and, if this practice becomes more pervasive globally, it may have a significant adverse effect on our net income in future periods.\nThe ultimate impact of MiFID II on payments for research globally currently is uncertain.\nAXA Equitable Holdings IPO\nOn May 10, 2017, AXA S.A. ( AXA\u201d) announced its intention to sell and list for trading a minority stake of its U.S. operations (expected to consist of AXA's U.S. Life & Savings business and its interest in AB) during the first half of 2018, subject to market conditions and SEC review process. While we cannot at this time predict the eventual impact, if any, on AB of this proposed transaction, it could include a reduction in the support AXA has provided to AB in the past with respect to AB's investment management business, resulting in a decrease to our revenues and ability to initiate new investment services. Also, AB relies on AXA for a number of significant services and benefits from its affiliation with AXA in certain common vendor relationships. These arrangements also may change with possible negative financial implications for AB.\nRelocation Strategy\nDuring 2017, we began exploring several U.S. cities for the purpose of establishing a second principal U.S. location. We intend to transition a significant number of our staff located in our New York metro offices to this new location once we have finalized the city and secured office space. The transition period is expected to last a number of years. We will continue to maintain an employee presence in New York City, which will remain a principal location.\nWe believe a second principal location will afford us the opportunity to provide an improved quality of life alternative for our employees, enable us to attract and recruit new talented employees to a highly desirable location while improving the long-term cost structure of the firm. However, we expect to incur potentially material costs through the transition period, including relocation, severance, and duplicative compensation and occupancy costs, before realizing ongoing cost savings. We currently are unable to estimate either the transitional costs or the ongoing cost savings as we have not yet completed our search process or finalized the scale of our relocation strategy.\nAdjusted Operating Margin Target\nWe have adopted a goal of increasing our adjusted operating margin from 27.7% (which we achieved for 2017) to a target of 30% by 2020 (the 2020 Margin Target\u201d), subject to the assumptions, factors and contingencies discussed below.\nActual results related to this target may vary depending on various factors, including capital market outcomes, the global regulatory environment in which we operate, the performance of our investment services, the net flows experienced by our investment services and the successful management of our costs. Also, the anticipated establishment of a second principal location outside of the New York City metropolitan area, which is described immediately above, will likely involve substantial transitional costs, including employee relocation, severance, recruitment and duplicative compensation and occupancy costs. We currently are unable to estimate precisely these interim transitional costs or the expected ongoing cost savings, or the timing of these costs and savings, as we have not yet completed our search process or finalized the scale of our relocation strategy. If the transitional costs we incur in 2019 and 2020 significantly exceed any cost savings we realize in those years from our relocation strategy, our actual adjusted operating margin for 2020 will be adversely affected and, as a result, we may not reach the 2020 Margin Target.\nIn setting our 2020 Margin Target, we have made significant assumptions with respect to, among other things:\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the levels of positive net flows into our investment services;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the level of growth (in terms of additional AUM) in our alternatives product business;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the rate of increase in our fixed costs due to inflation and similar factors, the transitional costs related to our relocation strategy and the timing of such costs, the success we have in achieving planned new cost reductions (including those relating to our relocation strategy) and the timing of such cost reductions, and the investments we make in our business; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>general conditions of the markets in which our business operates, including modest continued appreciation in both equity and fixed income total investment returns.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhile our 2020 Margin Target is presented with numerical specificity, and we believe the target to be reasonable as of the date of this report, the uncertainties surrounding the assumptions we discuss above create a significant risk that these assumptions may not be realized. Accordingly, our 2020 Margin Target may not be achieved, particularly if actual events adversely differ from one or more of our key assumptions. The 2020 Margin Target and its underlying assumptions are Forward-Looking Statements and can be affected by any of the factors discussed in Risk Factors\u201d and Cautions Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this 10-K. We strongly caution investors not to place undue reliance on any of these assumptions or our 2020 Margin Target. Except as may be required by applicable securities laws, we are not under any obligation, and we expressly disclaim any obligation, to update or alter any assumptions, estimates, financial goals, targets, projections or other related statements that we may make.\nAssets Under Management\nAssets under management by distribution channel are as follows:\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td>

We adopted this new accounting standard on January 1, 2018 on a modified retrospective basis, recognizing the cumulative effect of initial adoption in Partners' Capital. Based on our analysis performed to-date, we do not expect any changes in the timing of revenue recognition for our base fees, distribution revenues, shareholder servicing revenues and broker-dealer revenues. However, performance-based fees, which are currently recognized at the end of the applicable measurement period when no risk of reversal remains, and carried-interest distributions received (considered performance-based fees), which are currently recorded as deferred revenues until no risk of reversal remains, may in certain instances be recognized earlier under the new standard, if it is probable that significant reversal of performance-based fees recognized will not occur. Currently, we expect the cumulative effect of initial adoption in partners' capital as of January 1, 2018 to be approximately $35 million. This amount represents carried-interest distributions previously received, net of revenue sharing payments to investment team members, with respect to which it is probable that significant reversal will not occur. Our future financial statements will include additional disclosures as required by ASU 2014-09.\nReal Estate Charges\nSince 2010, in connection with our workforce reductions and in an effort to reduce our global real estate footprint, we have implemented a global office space consolidation. As a result, we have sub-leased over one million square feet of office space.\nDuring 2015, we recorded pre-tax real estate charges of $1.0 million, resulting from a change in estimates related to previously recorded real estate charges.\nDuring 2016, we recorded pre-tax real estate charges of $17.7 million, resulting from new charges of $22.8 million relating to the further consolidation of office space at our New York offices, offset by changes in estimates related to previously recorded real estate charges of $5.1 million, which reflected the shortening of the lease term of our corporate headquarters from 2029 to 2024.\nDuring 2017, we recorded pre-tax real estate charges of $36.7 million, resulting from new charges of $40.2 million primarily relating to the further consolidation of office space at our New York offices, offset by changes in estimates pertaining to previously recorded real estate charges of $3.5 million.\nUnits Outstanding\nEach quarter, we consider whether to implement a plan to repurchase AB Holding Units pursuant to Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act\u201d). A plan of this type allows a company to repurchase its shares at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so because of self-imposed trading blackout periods or because it possesses material non-public information. Each broker we select has the authority under the terms and limitations specified in the plan to repurchase AB Holding Units on our behalf in accordance with the terms of the plan. Repurchases are\nsubject to regulations promulgated by the SEC as well as certain price, market volume and timing constraints specified in the plan. The plan adopted during the fourth quarter of 2017 expired at the close of business on February 12, 2018. We may adopt additional plans in the future to engage in open-market purchases of AB Holding Units to help fund anticipated obligations under our incentive compensation award program and for other corporate purposes.\nCash Distributions\nWe are required to distribute all of our Available Cash Flow, as defined in the AB Partnership Agreement, to our Unitholders and the General Partner. Available Cash Flow typically is the adjusted diluted net income per unit for the quarter multiplied by the number of general and limited partnership interests at the end of the quarter. In future periods, management anticipates that Available Cash Flow will continue to be based on adjusted diluted net income per unit, unless management determines, with concurrence of the Board of Directors, that one or more adjustments that are made for adjusted net income should not be made with respect to the Available Cash Flow calculation. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 for a description of Available Cash Flow.\nManagement Operating Metrics\nWe are providing the non-GAAP measures adjusted net revenues\u201d, adjusted operating income\u201d and adjusted operating margin\u201d because they are the principal operating metrics management uses in evaluating and comparing period-to-period operating performance. Management principally uses these metrics in evaluating performance because they present a clearer picture of our operating performance and allow management to see long-term trends without the distortion primarily caused by long-term incentive compensation-related mark-to-market adjustments, real estate consolidation charges and other adjustment items. Similarly, we believe that these management operating metrics help investors better understand the underlying trends in our results and, accordingly, provide a valuable perspective for investors.\nThese non-GAAP measures are provided in addition to, and not as substitutes for, net revenues, operating income and operating margin, and they may not be comparable to non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. Management uses both accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"US GAAP\") and non-GAAP measures in evaluating our financial performance. The non-GAAP measures alone may pose limitations because they do not include all of our revenues and expenses.\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to higher investment advisory base fees of $207.9 million and higher performance-based fees of $72.4 million, offset by higher employee compensation expenses (excluding the impact of long-term incentive compensation-related items) of $76.7 million, higher general and administrative expenses of $32.2 million, lower Bernstein Research Services revenue of $30.0 million and higher net distribution expenses of $12.0 million. Adjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $5.8 million, or 0.9%, from the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to lower employee compensation expense (excluding the impact of long-term incentive compensation-related items) of $42.1 million, lower promotion and servicing expenses of $14.1 million, higher performance-based fees of $9.1 million and lower general and administrative expenses of $6.9 million, offset by lower investment advisory base fees of $46.4 million, lower Bernstein Research Services revenue of $13.6 million and higher net distribution expenses of $13.1 million.\nAdjusted Net Revenues\nAdjusted net revenues exclude investment gains and losses and dividends and interest on employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments. In addition, adjusted net revenues offset distribution-related payments to third parties as well as amortization of deferred sales commissions against distribution revenues. We believe offsetting net revenues by distribution-related payments is useful for our investors and other users of our financial statements because such presentation appropriately reflects the nature of these costs as pass-through payments to third parties who perform functions on behalf of our sponsored mutual funds and/or shareholders of these funds. We offset amortization of deferred sales commissions against net revenues because such costs, over time, essentially offset our distribution revenues. We also exclude additional pass-through expenses we incur (primarily through our transfer agency) that are reimbursed and recorded as fees in revenues. These fees do not affect operating income, but they do affect our operating margin. As such, we exclude these fees from adjusted net revenues.\nWe adjust for the revenue impact of consolidating company-sponsored investment funds by eliminating the consolidated company-sponsored investment funds' revenues and including AB's fees from such consolidated company-sponsored investment funds and AB's investment gains and losses on its investments in such consolidated company-sponsored investment funds that were eliminated in consolidation. In addition, in 2017 we excluded a cumulative realized gain of $4.6 million on the exchange of software technology for an ownership stake in a third party provider of financial market data and trading tools and in 2016 we excluded a realized gain of $75.3 million resulting from the liquidation of an investment in Jasper Wireless Technologies, Inc. (\"Jasper\"), which was acquired by Cisco Systems, Inc., because these transactions are not part of our core operating results. Lastly, we exclude 90% of the investment gains and losses of our consolidated venture capital fund attributable to non-controlling interests.\nAdjusted Operating Income\nAdjusted operating income represents operating income on a US GAAP basis excluding (1) the impact on net revenues and compensation expense of the investment gains and losses (as well as the dividends and interest) associated with employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments, (2) the gain on the sale of our investment in Jasper in 2016, (3) the gain on the sale of software technology during 2017, (4) real estate charges, (5) acquisition-related expenses, (6) adjustments to contingent payment arrangements, and (7) the impact of consolidated company-sponsored investment funds.\nPrior to 2009, a significant portion of employee compensation was in the form of employee long-term incentive compensation awards that were notionally invested in AB investment services and generally vested over a period of four years. AB economically hedged the exposure to market movements by purchasing and holding these investments on its balance sheet. All such investments had vested as of year-end 2012 and the investments have been delivered to the participants, except for those investments with respect to which the participant elected a long-term deferral. Fluctuation in the value of these investments is recorded within investment gains and losses on the income statement and also impacts compensation expense. Management believes it is useful to reflect the offset achieved from economically hedging the market exposure of these investments in the calculation of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin. The non-GAAP measures exclude gains and losses and dividends and interest on employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments included in revenues and compensation expense.\nA realized gain on the liquidation of our Jasper investment during 2016 has been excluded due to its non-recurring nature and because it is not part of our core operating results.\nA realized gain on the exchange of software technology for an ownership stake in a third party company during 2017 has been excluded due to its non-recurring nature and because it is not part of our core operating results.\nReal estate charges have been excluded because they are not considered part of our core operating results when comparing financial results from period to period and to industry peers.\nAcquisition-related expenses have been excluded because they are not considered part of our core operating results when comparing financial results from period to period and to industry peers.\nThe recording of changes in estimates of the contingent consideration payable with respect to contingent payment arrangements associated with our acquisitions are not considered part of our core operating results and, accordingly, have been excluded.\nWe adjusted for the operating income impact of consolidating certain company-sponsored investment funds by eliminating the consolidated company-sponsored funds' revenues and expenses and including AB's revenues and expenses that were eliminated in consolidation. We also excluded the limited partner interests we do not own.\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Net Income per AB Unit\nAs previously discussed, our quarterly distribution is typically our adjusted diluted net income per unit (which is derived from adjusted net income) for the quarter multiplied by the number of general and limited partnership interests at the end of the quarter. Adjusted income taxes, used in calculating adjusted net income, are calculated using the GAAP effective tax rate adjusted for non-GAAP income tax adjustments.\nAdjusted Operating Margin\nAdjusted operating margin allows us to monitor our financial performance and efficiency from period to period without the volatility noted above in our discussion of adjusted operating income and to compare our performance to industry peers on a basis that better reflects our performance in our core business. Adjusted operating margin is derived by dividing adjusted operating income by adjusted net revenues.\nNet Revenues\nThe components of net revenues are as follows:\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td>

<td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment Advisory and Services Fees\nInvestment advisory and services fees are the largest component of our revenues. These fees generally are calculated as a percentage of the value of AUM as of a specified date, or as a percentage of the value of average AUM for the applicable billing period, and vary with the type of investment service, the size of account and the total amount of assets we manage for a particular client. Accordingly, fee income generally increases or decreases as AUM increase or decrease and is affected by market appreciation or depreciation, the addition of new client accounts or client contributions of additional assets to existing accounts, withdrawals of assets from and termination of client accounts, purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares,\nshifts of assets between accounts or products with different fee structures, and acquisitions. Our average basis points realized (investment advisory and services fees divided by average AUM) generally approximate 40 to 110 basis points for actively-managed equity services, 10 to 75 basis points for actively-managed fixed income services and 2 to 20 basis points for passively-managed services. Average basis points realized for other services range from 5 basis points for certain Institutional asset allocation services to over 100 basis points for certain Retail and Private Wealth Management alternative services. These ranges include all-inclusive fee arrangements (covering investment management, trade execution and other services) for our Private Wealth Management clients.\nWe calculate AUM using established market-based valuation methods and fair valuation (non-observable market) methods. Market-based valuation methods include: last sale/settle prices from an exchange for actively-traded listed equities, options and futures; evaluated bid prices from recognized pricing vendors for fixed income, asset-backed or mortgage-backed issues; mid prices from recognized pricing vendors and brokers for credit default swaps; and quoted bids or spreads from pricing vendors and brokers for other derivative products. Fair valuation methods include: discounted cash flow models, evaluation of assets versus liabilities or any other methodology that is validated and approved by our Valuation Committee (see paragraph immediately below for more information regarding our Valuation Committee). Fair valuation methods are used only where AUM cannot be valued using market-based valuation methods, such as in the case of private equity or illiquid securities.\nThe Valuation Committee, which consists of senior officers and employees, is responsible for overseeing the pricing and valuation of all investments held in client and AB portfolios. The Valuation Committee has adopted a Statement of Pricing Policies describing principles and policies that apply to pricing and valuing investments held in these portfolios. We also have a Pricing Group, which reports to the Valuation Committee and is responsible for overseeing the pricing process for all investments.\nWe sometimes charge our clients performance-based fees. In these situations, we charge a base advisory fee and are eligible to earn an additional performance-based fee or incentive allocation that is calculated as either a percentage of absolute investment results or a percentage of investment results in excess of a stated benchmark over a specified period of time. Some performance-based fees include a high-watermark provision, which generally provides that if a client account underperforms relative to its performance target (whether absolute or relative to a specified benchmark), it must gain back such underperformance before we can collect future performance-based fees. Therefore, if we fail to achieve our performance target for a particular period, we will not earn a performance-based fee for that period and, for accounts with a high-watermark provision, our ability to earn future performance-based fees will be impaired. We are eligible to earn performance-based fees on 7.1%, 4.1% and 0.7% of the assets we manage for institutional clients, private wealth clients and retail clients, respectively (in total, 4.4% of our AUM).\nDuring 2016 and 2017, we received carried interest distributions of $77.8 million, as general partner of our real estate fund. In accordance with our current revenue recognition policies, we did not recognize these carried interest distributions as performance-based fee revenues, instead recording a deferred revenue liability, because the distributions are subject to claw-back provisions. In addition, we have revenue-sharing arrangements whereby certain employees are entitled to a share of carried interest proceeds distributed by certain funds, including the real estate fund. As such, we distributed $42.7 million of these carried interest proceeds to certain real estate fund employees. We have recorded this payment, which, like our carried interest distribution, is subject to claw-back provisions, as an advance to employees and will recognize it as compensation expense in the period in which the applicable revenue is recognized. Currently, we expect the net effect of these items to be included in the cumulative effect of initial adoption of ASU 2014-09 as of January 1, 2018. See Revenue Recognition previously discussed.\nOur investment advisory and services fees increased by $266.9 million, or 13.8%, in 2017, primarily due to a $204.9 million, or 10.8%, increase in base fees, which primarily resulted from a 7.9% increase in average AUM and the impact of a shift in distribution channel mix from Institutions to Retail and Private Wealth Management. Also, performance-based fees increased by $62.0 million. Our investment advisory and services fees decreased by $40.4 million, or 2.0%, in 2016, primarily due to a $49.4 million, or 2.5%, decrease in base fees, which primarily resulted from the impact of a shift in product mix from active equity products to active fixed income products, which generally have lower fees. However, our performance-based fees increased $9.0 million from the prior year.\nInstitutional investment advisory and services fees increased $53.8 million, or 12.8%, in 2017, primarily due to an increase in base fees of $26.0 million, or 6.5%, primarily resulting from a 4.3% increase in average AUM and the impact of a shift in product mix to active equities, which generally have higher fees. In addition, performance-based fees increased by $27.8 million. Institutional investment advisory and services fees decreased $13.6 million, or 3.1%, in 2016, primarily due to an $18.5 million, or 4.4%, decrease in base fees. The decrease in base fees resulted from a shift in product mix from active equities to active fixed income products, which generally have lower fees. However, performance-based fees increased $4.9 million from the prior year.\nRetail investment advisory and services fees increased $137.8 million, or 17.0%, in 2017, primarily due to an increase in base fees of $116.9 million, or 14.5%, primarily resulting from a 12.6% increase in average AUM and higher fee rate realization. In addition, performance-based fees increased by $20.9 million. Retail investment advisory and services fees decreased $47.1 million, or 5.5%, in 2016, primarily due to a $41.6 million, or 4.9%, decrease in base fees. The decrease in base fees was due to a decrease in average AUM of 1.8% and the impact of a shift in product mix from non-U.S. global fixed income mutual funds, non-U.S. global equity mutual funds and other products to U.S. tax-exempt mutual funds, which generally have lower fees. Additionally, performance-based fees decreased $5.5 million from the prior year.\nPrivate Wealth Management investment advisory and services fees increased by $75.4 million, or 10.7%, in 2017, due to an increase in base fees of $62.0 million, or 9.0%, primarily resulting from a 9.8% increase in average AUM. In addition, performance-based fees increased $13.4 million. Private Wealth Management investment advisory and services fees increased $20.3 million, or 3.0%, in 2016, due to an increase in base fees of $10.7 million, or 1.6%, resulting from a 2.2% increase in average AUM and a $9.6 million increase in performance-based fees.\nBernstein Research Services\nWe earn revenues for providing investment research to, and executing brokerage transactions for, institutional clients. These clients compensate us principally by directing us to execute brokerage transactions on their behalf, for which we earn commissions, and to a lesser extent by paying us directly for research through commission sharing agreements or cash payments.\nRevenues from Bernstein Research Services decreased $30.0 million, or 6.2%, in 2017. The decrease was driven by a decline in client activity in the U.S. and a volume mix shift to electronic trading in Europe. The decrease was partially offset by increased client activity in Asia and a weaker U.S. dollar year-over-year. Revenues from Bernstein Research Services decreased $13.6 million, or 2.8%, in 2016, as a result of lower market values and volumes in Europe and Asia and the discontinuation of our Equity Capital Market services.\nDistribution Revenues\nTwo of our subsidiaries act as distributors and/or placement agents of company-sponsored mutual funds and receive distribution services fees from certain of those funds as partial reimbursement of the distribution expenses they incur. Period-over-period fluctuations of distribution revenues typically are in line with fluctuations of the corresponding average AUM of these mutual funds.\nDistribution revenues increased $27.7 million, or 7.2%, in 2017, primarily due to the corresponding average AUM of these mutual funds increasing 11.2%, offset by the impact of a shift in product mix. During 2017, average AUM of A-share mutual funds (which have lower distribution fee rates than B-share and C-share mutual funds) increased 21.5%, while average AUM of B-share and C-share mutual funds decreased by 13.5%. Distribution revenues decreased $42.8 million, or 10.0%, in 2016, while the corresponding average AUM of these mutual funds decreased 8.0%.\nDividend and Interest Income and Interest Expense\nDividend and interest income consists primarily of investment income and interest earned on customer margin balances and U.S. Treasury Bills as well as dividend and interest income in our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. Interest expense principally reflects interest accrued on cash balances in customers' brokerage accounts. Dividend and interest income, net of interest expense, increased $8.2 million, or 21.6%, in 2017, primarily due to higher dividend and interest income in our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. Dividend and interest income, net of interest expense, increased $16.3 million, or 75.5%, in 2016, primarily due to the dividends related to our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds of $10.2 million and higher mutual fund dividends of $3.4 million.\nInvestment Gains (Losses)\nInvestment gains (losses) consist primarily of realized and unrealized investment gains or losses on: (i) employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments, (ii) U.S. Treasury Bills, (iii) market-making in exchange-traded options and equities, (iv) seed capital investments, (v) derivatives and (vi) investments in our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. Investment gains (losses) also include equity in earnings of proprietary investments in limited partnership hedge funds that we sponsor and manage.\nInvestment gains (losses) are as follows: Table 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term incentive compensation-related investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gains (losses)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized gains (losses)\n</td> <td>5,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(288\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,589\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated private equity fund investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gains (losses)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-public investments\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Public securities\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,500\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized gains (losses)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-public investments\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Public securities\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,028\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments held by consolidated company-sponsored investment funds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Realized gains (losses)\n</td> <td>59,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,482\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Unrealized gains (losses)\n</td> <td>36,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Seed capital investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gains (losses)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Seed capital\n</td> <td>24,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivatives\n</td> <td>(22,395\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15,207\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized gains (losses)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Seed capital\n</td> <td>(9,713\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34,830\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivatives\n</td> <td>(1,478\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(311\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brokerage-related investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gains (losses)\n</td> <td>(2,796\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,057\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,653\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized gains (losses)\n</td> <td>(284\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(150\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2017, we realized a gain of $4.6 million (included in realized gains of seed capital investments in table above) on the exchange of software technology for an ownership stake in a third party provider of financial market data and trading tools.\nDuring the first quarter of 2016, we sold our investment in Jasper, a company in which we owned a 7.6% equity interest. We expect to receive a total of $85.5 million in cash, subject to final transaction costs and working capital adjustments. During March 2016, the transaction closed and we received $74.8 million in cash, recorded a $10.7 million receivable (of which we have received $10.2 million as of December 31, 2017) for the balance retained in escrow for 18 months and recorded an investment gain of $75.3 million (included in realized gains of seed capital investments in table above).\nOther Revenues\nOther revenues consist of fees earned for transfer agency services provided to company-sponsored mutual funds, fees earned for administration and recordkeeping services provided to company-sponsored mutual funds and the general accounts of AXA and its subsidiaries, and other miscellaneous revenues. Other revenues decreased $1.8 million, or 1.8%, in 2017, primarily due to lower shareholder servicing fees, partly offset by higher mutual fund reimbursements. Other revenues decreased $1.3 million, or 1.3%, in 2016, primarily due to lower shareholder servicing fees.\nExpenses\nThe components of expenses are as follows:\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017-16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016-15\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee compensation and benefits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,313,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,229,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,267,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Promotion and servicing:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution-related payments\n</td> <td>420,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>371,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>393,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of deferred sales commissions\n</td> <td>31,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade execution, marketing, T&E and other\n</td> <td>204,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>208,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>223,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>656,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>621,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>665,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>481,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>426,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>431,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate charges\n</td> <td>36,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>518,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>443,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>432,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contingent payment arrangements\n</td> <td>267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20,245\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,441\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>272.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest\n</td> <td>8,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td>27,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,524,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,305,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,389,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEmployee Compensation and Benefits\nEmployee compensation and benefits consist of base compensation (including salaries and severance), annual short-term incentive compensation awards (cash bonuses), annual long-term incentive compensation awards, commissions, fringe benefits and other employment costs (including recruitment, training, temporary help and meals).\nCompensation expense as a percentage of net revenues was 39.8%, 40.6% and 42.0% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Compensation expense generally is determined on a discretionary basis and is primarily a function of our firm's current-year financial performance. The amounts of incentive compensation we award are designed to motivate, reward and retain top talent while aligning our executives' interests with the interests of our Unitholders. Senior management, with the approval of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of AllianceBernstein Corporation ( Compensation Committee\u201d), periodically confirms that the appropriate metric to consider in determining the amount of incentive compensation is the ratio of adjusted employee compensation and benefits expense to adjusted net revenues. Adjusted net revenues used in the adjusted compensation ratio are the same as the adjusted net revenues presented as a non-GAAP measure (discussed earlier in this Item 7). Adjusted employee compensation and benefits expense is total employee compensation and benefits expense minus other employment costs such as recruitment, training, temporary help and meals (which were 1.1%, 1.1% and 1.3% of adjusted net revenues for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively), and excludes the impact of mark-to-market vesting expense, as well as dividends and interest expense, associated with employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments. Senior management, with the approval of the Compensation Committee, has established as an objective that adjusted employee compensation and benefits expense generally should not exceed 50% of our adjusted net revenues, except in unexpected or unusual circumstances. Our ratios of adjusted compensation expense as a percentage of adjusted net revenues were 47.1%, 48.5% and 48.9%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nIn 2017, employee compensation and benefits expense increased $83.7 million, or 6.8%, primarily due to higher incentive compensation of $68.4 million, higher base compensation of $5.4 million, which primarily resulted from higher severance, higher commissions of $4.8 million and higher fringes of $4.1 million. In 2016, employee compensation and benefits expense decreased $38.2 million, or 3.0%, primarily due to lower incentive compensation of $33.6 million, lower fringes/other of $8.0 million and lower commissions of $6.4 million, partially offset by higher base compensation of $9.8 million reflecting higher severance costs.\nPromotion and Servicing\nPromotion and servicing expenses include distribution-related payments to financial intermediaries for distribution of AB mutual funds and amortization of deferred sales commissions paid to financial intermediaries for the sale of back-end load shares of AB mutual funds. Also included in this expense category are costs related to travel and entertainment, advertising and promotional materials.\nPromotion and servicing expenses increased $35.4 million, or 5.7%, in 2017. The increase primarily was due to higher distribution-related payments of $48.7 million, offset by lower amortization of deferred sales commissions of $9.2 million, lower travel and entertainment costs of $2.6 million and lower transfer fees of $2.1 million. Promotion and servicing expenses decreased $44.4 million, or 6.7%, in 2016. The decrease primarily was due to lower distribution-related payments of $21.4 million, lower amortization of deferred sales commissions of $8.1 million, lower travel and entertainment expenses of $6.3 million, lower marketing expenses of $5.1 million and lower transfer fees of $4.8 million.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses include portfolio services expenses, technology expenses, professional fees and office-related expenses (occupancy, communications and similar expenses). General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 15.7% (14.6% excluding real estate charges), 14.7% (14.1% excluding real estate charges) and 14.3% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. General and administrative expenses increased $74.3 million, or 16.7%, during 2017, primarily due to higher expenses related to our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds of $25.5 million, the vendor termination accrual of $19.7 million we describe below, higher real estate charges of $19.0 million and higher professional fees of $6.5 million. General and administrative expenses increased $11.2 million, or 2.6%, in 2016, primarily due to higher real estate charges of $16.7 million, offset by lower professional fees of $6.3 million.\nDuring the third quarter of 2017, we recorded a $19.7 million reserve for a payment we expect to make to a third-party vendor as a result of the early termination of an outsourcing contract relating to our trade settlement and reconciliation processes. We intend to transition these processes back to AB from our vendor within the next two years. As a result of this transition, we expect to incur $2 million in additional transitional costs in 2018 and realize ongoing annual savings of approximately $11 million in general and administrative expenses beginning in 2019.\nContingent Payment Arrangements\nContingent payment arrangements reflect changes in estimates of contingent payment liabilities associated with acquisitions in previous periods, as well as accretion expense of these liabilities. The expense of $0.3 million for 2017 reflects accretion expenses of $0.5 million, offset by a change in estimate of the contingent consideration payable relating to our 2010 acquisition of $0.2 million. The credit to operating expenses of $20.2 million in 2016 reflects changes in estimates of contingent consideration payable of $21.5 million relating to our 2013 and 2010 acquisitions, offset by the accretion expense of $1.3 million. The credit to operating expenses of $5.4 million in 2015 reflects changes in estimate of the contingent consideration payable relating to our 2014 and 2010 acquisitions of $7.2 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015, offset by the accretion expense of $1.8 million.\nInterest\nInterest expense increased 72.0% and 52.8% in 2017 and 2016, respectively, reflecting higher weighted average interest rates on commercial paper borrowings and higher average daily borrowings of commercial paper. Average daily borrowings of commercial paper during 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $482.2 million, $422.9 million and $387.9 million, respectively, with weighted average interest rates of 1.2%, 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nAB, a private limited partnership, is not subject to federal or state corporate income taxes, but is subject to a 4.0% New York City unincorporated business tax ( UBT\u201d). Our domestic corporate subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and local income taxes and generally are included in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return. Separate state and local income tax returns also are filed. Foreign corporate subsidiaries generally are subject to taxes in the jurisdictions where they are located.\nWe determined reasonable estimates for certain effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( 2017 Tax Act\u201d) enacted on December 22, 2017 and recorded those estimates as provisional amounts in our 2017 financial statements. In accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d), the adjustments to deferred tax assets and liabilities and the liability related to the transition tax are provisional amounts estimated based on information available as of December 31, 2017. These amounts are subject to change as we obtain information necessary to complete the calculations. We will recognize any changes to the provisional amounts as we refine our estimates and as the tax authorities issue further guidance and interpretations of the 2017 Tax Act.\nThe major provisions of the 2017 Tax Act that had, or could have, a significant impact on our income tax balance sheet and income statement accounts are as follows:\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We recorded an approximate $22.5 million charge to our 2017 income tax expense to account for deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. The determination of the transition tax requires further analysis regarding the amount and composition of our historical foreign earnings.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We recorded an approximate $3.3 million charge to our 2017 income tax expense to reduce our deferred tax assets due to lower future corporate tax rates. We will recognize any changes to the provisional amounts as we refine our estimates of our cumulative temporary differences.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We are currently analyzing the possible impact on us of the tax on global intangible low-taxed income ( GILTI\u201d), if any. The GILTI tax is effective in 2018; as such, we have not recorded any amounts in our 2017 financial statements for the GILTI provision.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome tax expense increased $24.8 million, or 87.5%, in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase is due to a higher effective tax rate in 2017 of 6.9%, compared to 3.9% in 2016, and higher pre-tax income. The significant increase in our effective tax rate was driven by the deemed repatriation tax on foreign earnings, the tax associated with the remeasurement of deferred tax items, and the unfavorable mix of earnings across the AB tax filing groups.\nIncome tax expense decreased $16.5 million, or 36.8%, in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a lower effective tax rate in 2016 of 3.9% compared to 7.1% in 2015, offset by higher pre-tax income. The significant decrease in our effective tax rate was driven by a fourth quarter 2016 change in estimate made to our income tax liability relating to the third quarter 2016 revision to income taxes ($13.3 million) and a reversal of a deferred tax liability relating to foreign translation adjustments ($8.2 million).\nNet Income (Loss) of Consolidated Entities Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests\nNet income (loss) of consolidated entities attributable to non-controlling interests primarily consists of limited partner interests owned by other investors in our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. In 2017, we had $58.4 million of net gains of consolidated entities attributable to non-controlling interests, primarily due to gains on investments held by our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. In 2016, we had $21.5 million of net income of consolidated entities attributable to non-controlling interests, primarily due to gains on investments held by our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. In 2015, we had $6.4 million of net income of consolidated entities attributable to non-controlling interests, primarily due to a $7.9 million net investment gain attributable to our consolidated venture capital fund (of which 90% belongs to non-controlling interests) and management fees of $1.2 million.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nDuring 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $645.5 million, compared to $1.5 billion during 2016. The change primarily was due to a decrease in net activity of our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds of $491.7 million, a decrease in broker-dealer payables (net of receivable and segregated U.S. Treasury Bills activity) of $376.3 million and lower net redemptions of seed capital and higher net purchases of broker-dealer investments of $162.3 million, offset by an increase in cash provided by net income of $86.5 million. During 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $1.5 billion, compared to $667.2 million during 2015. The change primarily was due to a significant increase in broker-dealer related payables, net of receivables and segregated U.S. Treasury Bills activity of $403.9 million, the impact of the consolidation of company-sponsored investment funds of $270.3 million and higher seed capital net redemptions, offset by higher net broker-dealer purchases of $104.6 million.\nDuring 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $39.3 million, compared to $59.4 million during 2016. The change primarily reflects $20.5 million spent in 2016 to purchase a business. During 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $59.4 million, compared to $26.1 million during 2015. The increase primarily resulted from the $20.5 million used to purchase a business and higher purchases of furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements of $6.5 million.\nDuring 2017, net cash used in financing activities was $623.9 million, compared to $1.1 billion during 2016. The change reflects the net purchases of non-controlling interests of consolidated company-sponsored investment funds in 2017 as compared to net redemptions of consolidated company-sponsored investment funds in 2016 (impact of $296.0 million), a net increase in overdrafts payable of $147.9 million, proceeds from bank loans of $75.0 million and lower net repayments of commercial paper of $43.5 million, offset by higher distributions to the General Partner and Unitholders of $106.6 million. During 2016, net cash used in financing activities was $1.1 billion, compared to $644.7 million during 2015. The change reflects the net repayment of commercial paper in 2016 as compared to the net issuance of commercial paper in 2015 (impact of $165.9 million), a decrease in overdrafts payable of $164.1 million, redemptions of non-controlling interests in consolidated\ncompany-sponsored investments funds of $137.4 million and higher repurchases of AB Holding Units of $22.4 million, offset by lower distributions to the General Partner and Unitholders of $60.3 million as a result of lower earnings (distributions on earnings are paid one quarter in arrears).\nAs of December 31, 2017, AB had $671.9 million of cash and cash equivalents (excluding cash and cash equivalents of consolidated company-sponsored investment funds), all of which are available for liquidity, but consist primarily of cash on deposit for our broker-dealers to comply with various customer clearing activities, and cash held by foreign subsidiaries of $469.9 million.\nDebt and Credit Facilities\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, AB had $491.8 million and $513.0 million, respectively, in commercial paper outstanding with weighted average interest rates of approximately 1.6% and 0.9%, respectively. The commercial paper is short term in nature, and as such, recorded value is estimated to approximate fair value (and considered a Level 2 security in the fair value hierarchy). Average daily borrowings of commercial paper during 2017 and 2016 were $482.2 million and $422.9 million, respectively, with weighted average interest rates of approximately 1.2% and 0.6% respectively.\nAB has a $1.0 billion committed, unsecured senior revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility\u201d) with a group of commercial banks and other lenders, which matures on October 22, 2019. The Credit Facility provides for possible increases in the principal amount by up to an aggregate incremental amount of $250.0 million; any such increase is subject to the consent of the affected lenders. The Credit Facility is available for AB and Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC ( SCB LLC\u201d) business purposes, including the support of AB's $1.0 billion commercial paper program. Both AB and SCB LLC can draw directly under the Credit Facility and management may draw on the Credit Facility from time to time. AB has agreed to guarantee the obligations of SCB LLC under the Credit Facility.\nThe Credit Facility contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, which are customary for facilities of this type, including restrictions on dispositions of assets, restrictions on liens, a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with these covenants. The Credit Facility also includes customary events of default (with customary grace periods, as applicable), including provisions under which, upon the\noccurrence of an event of default, all outstanding loans may be accelerated and/or lender's commitments may be terminated. Also, under such provisions, upon the occurrence of certain insolvency- or bankruptcy-related events of default, all amounts payable under the Credit Facility would automatically become immediately due and payable, and the lender's commitments would automatically terminate.\nAmounts under the Credit Facility may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed by us from time to time until the maturity of the facility. Voluntary prepayments and commitment reductions requested by us are permitted at any time without fee (other than customary breakage costs relating to the prepayment of any drawn loans) upon proper notice and subject to a minimum dollar requirement. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum, which will be, at our option, a rate equal to an applicable margin, which is subject to adjustment based on the credit ratings of AB, plus one of the following indexes: London Interbank Offered Rate; a floating base rate; or the Federal Funds rate.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had no amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility. During 2017 and 2016, we did not draw upon the Credit Facility.\nOn December 1, 2016, AB entered into a $200.0 million, unsecured 364-day senior revolving credit facility (the Revolver\u201d) with a leading international bank and the other lending institutions that may be party thereto. On November 29, 2017, as part of an amendment and restatement, the maturity date of the Revolver was extended from November 29, 2017 to November 28, 2018. There were no other significant changes included in the amendment. The Revolver is available for AB's and SCB LLC's business purposes, including the provision of additional liquidity to meet funding requirements primarily related to SCB LLC's operations. Both AB and SCB LLC can draw directly under the Revolver and management expects to draw on the Revolver from time to time. AB has agreed to guarantee the obligations of SCB LLC under the Revolver. The Revolver contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants which are identical to those of the Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2017, we had $75.0 million outstanding under the Revolver with an interest rate of 2.4%. As of December 31, 2016, we had no amounts outstanding under the Revolver. Average daily borrowings for 2017 and 2016 were $21.4 million and $7.3 million, respectively, with a weighted average interest rates of 2.0% and 1.6%, respectively.\nIn addition, SCB LLC currently has three uncommitted lines of credit with three financial institutions. Two of these lines of credit permit us to borrow up to an aggregate of approximately $175.0 million, with AB named as an additional borrower, while the other line has no stated limit. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, SCB LLC had no bank loans outstanding. Average daily borrowings of bank loans during 2017 and 2016 were $4.5 million and $4.4 million, respectively, with weighted average interest rates of approximately 1.4% and 1.1%, respectively.\nOur financial condition and access to public and private debt markets should provide adequate liquidity for our general business needs. Management believes that cash flow from operations and the issuance of debt and AB Units or AB Holding Units will provide us with the resources we need to meet our financial obligations. See Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A and Cautions Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this Item 7 for a discussion of credit markets and our ability to renew our credit facilities at expiration.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations\nGuarantees\nUnder various circumstances, AB guarantees the obligations of its consolidated subsidiaries.\nAB maintains guarantees in connection with the Credit Facility and Revolver. If SCB LLC is unable to meet its obligations, AB will pay the obligations when due or on demand. In addition, AB maintains guarantees totaling $375 million for SCB LLC's three uncommitted lines of credit.\nAB maintains a guarantee with a commercial bank, under which we guarantee the obligations in the ordinary course of business of each of SCB LLC, our U.K.-based broker-dealer and our Cayman subsidiary. We also maintain three additional guarantees with other commercial banks under which we guarantee approximately $410 million of obligations for our U.K.-based broker-dealer. In the event that any of these three entities is unable to meet its obligations, AB will pay the obligations when due or on demand.\nWe also have two smaller guarantees with a commercial bank totaling approximately $1.6 million, under which we guarantee certain obligations in the ordinary course of business of one of our foreign subsidiaries.\nWe have not been required to perform under any of the above agreements and currently have no liability in connection with these agreements.\nAggregate Contractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 are as follows:\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial paper\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>565.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>565.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases, net of sublease commitments\n</td> <td>542.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>159.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>155.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funding commitments\n</td> <td>22.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accrued compensation and benefits\n</td> <td>246.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrecognized tax benefits\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,384.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>821.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>210.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>163.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2010, as general partner of AllianceBernstein U.S. Real Estate L.P. ( Real Estate Fund\u201d), we committed to invest $25.0 million in the Real Estate Fund. As of December 31, 2017, we had funded $22.4 million of this commitment. During 2014, as general partner of AllianceBernstein U.S. Real Estate II L.P. ( Real Estate Fund II\u201d), we committed to invest $28.0 million, as amended in 2015, in the Real Estate Fund II. As of December 31, 2017, we had funded $10.4 million of this commitment.\nDuring 2012, we entered into an investment agreement under which we committed to invest up to $8.0 million in an oil and gas fund over a three-year period. As of December 31, 2017, we had funded $6.2 million of this commitment.\nAccrued compensation and benefits amounts in the table above exclude our accrued pension obligation. Offsetting our accrued compensation obligations are long-term incentive compensation-related investments and money market investments we funded totaling $71.5 million, which are included in our consolidated statement of financial condition. Any amounts reflected on the consolidated statement of financial condition as payables (to broker-dealers, brokerage clients and company-sponsored mutual funds) and accounts payable and accrued expenses are excluded from the table above.\nWe expect to make contributions to our qualified profit sharing plan of approximately $14 million in each of the next four years. We currently estimate that we will contribute $5 million to the Retirement Plan during 2018.\nContingencies\nSee Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.\nManagement believes that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below involve significant management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions used.\nGoodwill\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had goodwill of $3.1 billion on the consolidated statement of financial condition. We have determined that AB has only one reporting segment and reporting unit. We test our goodwill annually, as of September 30, for impairment. As of September 30, 2017, the impairment test indicated that goodwill was not impaired. The carrying value of goodwill is also reviewed if facts and circumstances occur that suggest possible impairment, such as significant declines in AUM, revenues, earnings or the price of an AB Holding Unit.\nOn an annual basis, or when circumstances warrant, we perform step one of our two-step goodwill impairment test. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of AB, the reporting unit, with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not performed. However, if the carrying value of the\nreporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit to the aggregated fair values of its individual assets and liabilities to determine the amount of impairment, if any.\nAB estimates its fair value under both the market approach and income approach. Under the market approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is based on its unadjusted market valuation (AB Units outstanding multiplied by the price of an AB Holding Unit) and adjusted market valuations assuming a control premium and earnings multiples. The price of a publicly-traded AB Holding Unit serves as a reasonable starting point for valuing an AB Unit because each represents the same fractional interest in our underlying business. Our market approach analysis also includes control premiums, which are based on an analysis of control premiums for relevant recent acquisitions, and comparable industry earnings multiples applied to our earnings forecast. Under the income approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Determining estimated fair value using a discounted cash flow valuation technique consists of applying business growth rate assumptions over the estimated life of the goodwill asset and then discounting the resulting expected cash flows using an estimated weighted average cost of capital of market participants to arrive at a present value amount that approximates fair value.\nReal Estate Charges\nSince 2010, in connection with our workforce reductions and in an effort to reduce our global real estate footprint, we have implemented a global office space consolidation. As a result, we have sub-leased over one million square feet of office space.\nWe recorded real estate charges that reflect the net present value of the difference between the amount of our on-going contractual lease obligations for the vacated floors and our estimate of current market rental rates for such floors. The charges we recorded were based on current assumptions at the time of the charges regarding sublease marketing periods, costs to prepare the properties to market, market rental rates, broker commissions and subtenant allowances/incentives, all of which are factors largely beyond our control. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, we may need to record additional charges or reduce previously recorded charges. We review the assumptions and estimates we used in recording these charges on a quarterly basis.\nLoss Contingencies\nManagement continuously reviews with legal counsel the status of regulatory matters and pending or threatened litigation. We evaluate the likelihood that a loss contingency exists and record a loss contingency if it is both probable and reasonably estimable as of the date of the financial statements. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\nAccounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\nCautions Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements provided by management in this report are forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The most significant of these factors include, but are not limited to, the following: the performance of financial markets, the investment performance of sponsored investment products and separately-managed accounts, general economic conditions, industry trends, future acquisitions, integration of acquired companies, competitive conditions and government regulations, including changes in tax regulations and rates and the manner in which the earnings of publicly-traded partnerships are taxed. We caution readers to carefully consider such factors. Further, these forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made; we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements. For further information regarding these forward-looking statements and the factors that could cause actual results to differ, see Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A. Any or all of the forward-looking statements that we make in this Form 10-K, other documents we file with or furnish to the SEC, and any other public statements we issue, may turn out to be wrong. It is important to remember that other factors besides those listed in Risk Factors\u201d and those listed below could also adversely impact our revenues, financial condition, results of operations and business prospects.\nThe forward-looking statements referred to in the preceding paragraph, most of which directly affect AB but also affect AB Holding because AB Holding's principal source of income and cash flow is attributable to its investment in AB, include statements regarding:\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our belief that the cash flow AB Holding realizes from its investment in AB will provide AB Holding with the resources it needs to meet its financial obligations: AB Holding's cash flow is dependent on the quarterly cash distributions it receives from AB.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nPercentage change figures are calculated using assets under management rounded to the nearest million and financial statement amounts rounded to the nearest thousand.\nExecutive Overview\nOur total assets under management ( AUM\u201d) as of December 31, 2017 were $554.5 billion, up $74.3 billion, or 15.5%, during 2017. The increase was driven by market appreciation of $61.1 billion and net inflows of $13.2 billion (primarily due to Retail and Institutional inflows of $8.9 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively).\nInstitutional AUM increased $30.0 billion, or 12.5%, to $269.3 billion during 2017, due to market appreciation of $26.4 billion and net inflows of $3.6 billion. Gross sales decreased $8.2 billion, or 38.1%, from $21.6 billion in 2016 to $13.4 billion in 2017. Redemptions and terminations decreased $4.2 billion, or 27.3%, from $15.7 billion in 2016 to $11.5 billion in 2017.\nRetail AUM increased $32.7 billion, or 20.5%, to $192.9 billion during 2017, due to market appreciation of $23.8 billion and net inflows of $8.9 billion. Gross sales increased $12.6 billion, or 30.5%, from $41.2 billion in 2016 to $53.8 billion in 2017. Redemptions and terminations decreased $2.2 billion, or 5.4%, from $40.8 billion in 2016 to $38.6 billion in 2017.\nPrivate Wealth Management AUM increased $11.6 billion, or 14.2%, to $92.3 billion during 2017, due to market appreciation of $10.9 billion and net inflows of $0.7 billion. Gross sales increased $1.3 billion, or 13.2%, from $10.2 billion in 2016 to $11.5 billion in 2017. Redemptions and terminations increased $1.3 billion, or 14.2%, from $9.3 billion in 2016 to $10.6 billion in 2017.\nBernstein Research Services revenue decreased $30.0 million, or 6.2%, in 2017. The decrease was driven by a decline in client activity in the U.S. and a volume mix shift to electronic trading in Europe. The decrease was partially offset by increased client activity in Asia and a weaker U.S. dollar year-over-year.\nOur 2017 revenues of $3.3 billion increased $0.3 billion, or 8.9%, compared to the prior year's net revenues of $3.0 billion. The most significant contributors to the increase were higher base advisory fees of $204.9 million, higher performance-based fees of $62.0 million and higher distribution revenues of $27.7 million, offset by lower Bernstein Research Services revenue of $30.0 million. Our operating expenses of $2.5 billion increased $0.2 billion, or 9.5%, compared to the prior year's expenses of $2.3 billion. The increase primarily was due to higher employee compensation and benefits of $83.7 million, higher general and administrative expenses (excluding real estate charges) of $55.3 million, higher promotion and servicing expenses of $35.4 million, lower adjustments to contingent payment arrangements of $20.5 million and higher real estate charges of $19.0 million. Our operating income increased $50.7 million, or 7.0%, to $773.9 million from $723.2 million in 2016 and our operating margin decreased from 23.2% in 2016 to 21.7% in 2017 as higher expenses outpaced revenue growth.\nMarket Environment\nGlobal equity markets increased substantially in 2017, and fixed income markets rose as well, as the global recovery gained momentum and breadth throughout the year. For the first time in the past five years, non-U.S. stocks outperformed U.S. stocks, aided by a weaker dollar, and credit spreads tightened in a risk-on\u201d environment. After an uncertain and volatile 2016, U.S. market volatility was exceptionally low in 2017. While 2018 got off to a strong start, U.S. equity markets began to vacillate wildly in February, and volatility surged as a result of a sharp rise in investor concern over the pace of interest rate hikes and the chances of rising inflation, which could slow economic growth. These stresses created uncertainty across global markets as well.\nDespite the strong run in the global markets, inflation so far remains low and Central Banks' monetary policies continue to vary among developed and emerging markets. In the U.S., three interest rate increases occurred during 2017 and several more are predicted for 2018, particularly if the economy continues to exhibit low unemployment, ongoing growth and emerging evidence of rising inflation. It remains to be seen how new tax legislation enacted in December 2017 will affect the U.S. economy going forward. In Europe, which is earlier in its economic recovery than the U.S., asset purchases by the European Central Bank are expected to end in 2018, Brexit negotiations are ongoing and MiFID II went into effect at the start of 2018. And in China, with the pace of growth slowing, quality\u201d of growth is increasing in importance.\nThe challenges for active fund managers continued in 2017. While their investment performance improved on average in 2017, they still struggled to attract net new assets in the face of ongoing overwhelming demand for passive equity strategies and accelerating demand for passive fixed income strategies. In the U.S., where the shift from active to passive has been most prevalent, total industry-wide active mutual fund flows turned positive in 2017, with $56 billion, on strength in fixed income and international equity services. Active U.S. equity mutual funds, however, still sustained $201 billion in outflows for the year,\neven though the percentage of outperforming active equity managers increased to 50%, versus 26% in 2016 and a long-term average of 34%. Meanwhile, total passive inflows continued to accelerate in 2017 and reached an all-time high of $692 billion.\nMiFID II\nThe second installment of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II ( MiFID II\u201d), which became effective January 3, 2018, makes significant modifications to the manner in which European broker-dealers can be compensated for research. These modifications are recognized in the industry as having the potential to significantly decrease the overall research spend by European buy-side firms. Consequently, our U.K.-based broker-dealer is considering new charging mechanisms for its research in order to minimize this impact as part of its broader MiFID II implementation program. It is important to note, however, that our new charging techniques and other strategic decisions to address the new environment created by MiFID II may not be successful, which could result in a significant decline in our sell-side revenues.\nAlso, although MiFID II does permit buy-side firms to purchase research through the use of client-funded research payment accounts, most buy-side firms that operate in the Eurozone, including our U.K. buy-side subsidiaries, have decided to use their own funds to pay for research in the Eurozone. This change in practice will increase our expenses in the Eurozone and, if this practice becomes more pervasive globally, it may have a significant adverse effect on our net income in future periods.\nThe ultimate impact of MiFID II on payments for research globally currently is uncertain.\nAXA Equitable Holdings IPO\nOn May 10, 2017, AXA S.A. ( AXA\u201d) announced its intention to sell and list for trading a minority stake of its U.S. operations (expected to consist of AXA's U.S. Life & Savings business and its interest in AB) during the first half of 2018, subject to market conditions and SEC review process. While we cannot at this time predict the eventual impact, if any, on AB of this proposed transaction, it could include a reduction in the support AXA has provided to AB in the past with respect to AB's investment management business, resulting in a decrease to our revenues and ability to initiate new investment services. Also, AB relies on AXA for a number of significant services and benefits from its affiliation with AXA in certain common vendor relationships. These arrangements also may change with possible negative financial implications for AB.\nRelocation Strategy\nDuring 2017, we began exploring several U.S. cities for the purpose of establishing a second principal U.S. location. We intend to transition a significant number of our staff located in our New York metro offices to this new location once we have finalized the city and secured office space. The transition period is expected to last a number of years. We will continue to maintain an employee presence in New York City, which will remain a principal location.\nWe believe a second principal location will afford us the opportunity to provide an improved quality of life alternative for our employees, enable us to attract and recruit new talented employees to a highly desirable location while improving the long-term cost structure of the firm. However, we expect to incur potentially material costs through the transition period, including relocation, severance, and duplicative compensation and occupancy costs, before realizing ongoing cost savings. We currently are unable to estimate either the transitional costs or the ongoing cost savings as we have not yet completed our search process or finalized the scale of our relocation strategy.\nAdjusted Operating Margin Target\nWe have adopted a goal of increasing our adjusted operating margin from 27.7% (which we achieved for 2017) to a target of 30% by 2020 (the 2020 Margin Target\u201d), subject to the assumptions, factors and contingencies discussed below.\nActual results related to this target may vary depending on various factors, including capital market outcomes, the global regulatory environment in which we operate, the performance of our investment services, the net flows experienced by our investment services and the successful management of our costs. Also, the anticipated establishment of a second principal location outside of the New York City metropolitan area, which is described immediately above, will likely involve substantial transitional costs, including employee relocation, severance, recruitment and duplicative compensation and occupancy costs. We currently are unable to estimate precisely these interim transitional costs or the expected ongoing cost savings, or the timing of these costs and savings, as we have not yet completed our search process or finalized the scale of our relocation strategy. If the transitional costs we incur in 2019 and 2020 significantly exceed any cost savings we realize in those years from our relocation strategy, our actual adjusted operating margin for 2020 will be adversely affected and, as a result, we may not reach the 2020 Margin Target.\nIn setting our 2020 Margin Target, we have made significant assumptions with respect to, among other things:\n \u2022 the levels of positive net flows into our investment services; \n \u2022 the level of growth (in terms of additional AUM) in our alternatives product business; \n \u2022 the rate of increase in our fixed costs due to inflation and similar factors, the transitional costs related to our relocation strategy and the timing of such costs, the success we have in achieving planned new cost reductions (including those relating to our relocation strategy) and the timing of such cost reductions, and the investments we make in our business; and \n \u2022 general conditions of the markets in which our business operates, including modest continued appreciation in both equity and fixed income total investment returns. \nWhile our 2020 Margin Target is presented with numerical specificity, and we believe the target to be reasonable as of the date of this report, the uncertainties surrounding the assumptions we discuss above create a significant risk that these assumptions may not be realized. Accordingly, our 2020 Margin Target may not be achieved, particularly if actual events adversely differ from one or more of our key assumptions. The 2020 Margin Target and its underlying assumptions are Forward-Looking Statements and can be affected by any of the factors discussed in Risk Factors\u201d and Cautions Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this 10-K. We strongly caution investors not to place undue reliance on any of these assumptions or our 2020 Margin Target. Except as may be required by applicable securities laws, we are not under any obligation, and we expressly disclaim any obligation, to update or alter any assumptions, estimates, financial goals, targets, projections or other related statements that we may make.\nAssets Under Management\nAssets under management by distribution channel are as follows:\n\nAssets under management by investment service are as follows:\n\n \n (1) Includes index and enhanced index services. \n (2) Includes certain multi-asset solutions and services and certain alternative investments. \nChanges in assets under management during 2017 and 2016 are as follows:\n\n\n \n (1) Includes index and enhanced index services. \n (2) Includes certain multi-asset solutions and services and certain alternative investments. \n (3) During the second quarter of 2016, we removed $3.0 billion of Customized Retirement Solutions assets from AUM as our asset management services transitioned to consulting services. In addition, we previously made minor adjustments to reported AUM for reporting methodology changes that do not represent inflows or outflows. \nNet long-term inflows (outflows) for actively managed investment services as compared to passively managed investment services during 2017 and 2016 are as follows:\n\nAverage assets under management by distribution channel and investment service are as follows:\n\n \n (1) Includes index and enhanced index services. \n (2) Includes certain multi-asset solutions and services and certain alternative investments.  During 2017, our Institutional channel average AUM of $253.8 billion increased $10.4 billion, or 4.3%, compared to 2016, primarily due to our Institutional AUM increasing $30.0 billion, or 12.5%, to $269.3 billion over the last twelve months. The $30.0 billion increase in AUM resulted from market appreciation of $26.4 billion and net inflows of $3.6 billion. During 2016, our Institutional channel average AUM of $243.4 billion increased $0.5 billion, or 0.2%, compared to 2015, primarily due to\nour Institutional AUM increasing $3.1 billion, or 1.3%, to $239.3 billion during 2016. The $3.1 billion increase in AUM primarily resulted from market appreciation of $9.0 billion, offset by net outflows of $5.4 billion.\nDuring 2017, our Retail channel average AUM of $177.5 billion increased $19.8 billion, or 12.6%, compared to 2016, primarily due to our Retail AUM increasing $32.7 billion, or 20.5%, to $192.9 billion over the last twelve months. The $32.7 billion increase in AUM resulted from market appreciation of $23.8 billion and net inflows of $8.9 billion. During 2016, our Retail channel average AUM of $157.7 billion decreased $2.9 billion, or 1.8%, compared to 2015; however, our Retail channel AUM increased $5.8 billion, or 3.8%, to $160.2 billion during 2016. The $5.8 billion increase in AUM for 2016 primarily resulted from market appreciation of $10.5 billion, offset by net outflows of $4.8 billion.\nDuring 2017, our Private Wealth Management channel average AUM of $86.7 billion increased $7.8 billion, or 9.8%, compared to 2016, primarily due to our Private Wealth Management AUM increasing $11.6 billion, or 14.2%, to $92.3 billion over the last twelve months. The $11.6 billion increase in AUM resulted from market appreciation of $10.9 billion and net inflows of $0.7 billion. During 2016, our Private Wealth Management channel average AUM of $78.9 billion increased $1.7 billion, or 2.2%, compared to 2015, primarily due to our Private Wealth Management AUM increasing $3.9 billion, or 5.1%, to $80.7 billion during 2016. The $3.9 billion increase in AUM for 2016 primarily resulted from market appreciation of $3.6 billion and net inflows of $0.4 billion.\nAbsolute investment composite returns, gross of fees, and relative performance as of December 31, 2017 compared to benchmarks for certain representative Institutional equity and fixed income services are as follows:\n\n\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n\n \n (1) Operating income excluding net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests as a percentage of net revenues. \nNet income attributable to AB Unitholders for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased $11.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease primarily is due to (in millions):\n\nNet income attributable to AB Unitholders for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $93.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase primarily was due to (in millions):\n\nRevenue Recognition\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which revises revenue recognition criteria for revenue arising from contracts with customers, requires certain costs to obtain and fulfill contracts with customers to be capitalized if they meet certain criteria, and expands disclosure requirements. We adopted this new accounting standard on January 1, 2018 on a modified retrospective basis, recognizing the cumulative effect of initial adoption in Partners' Capital. Based on our analysis performed to-date, we do not expect any changes in the timing of revenue recognition for our base fees, distribution revenues, shareholder servicing revenues and broker-dealer revenues. However, performance-based fees, which are currently recognized at the end of the applicable measurement period when no risk of reversal remains, and carried-interest distributions received (considered performance-based fees), which are currently recorded as deferred revenues until no risk of reversal remains, may in certain instances be recognized earlier under the new standard, if it is probable that significant reversal of performance-based fees recognized will not occur. Currently, we expect the cumulative effect of initial adoption in partners' capital as of January 1, 2018 to be approximately $35 million. This amount represents carried-interest distributions previously received, net of revenue sharing payments to investment team members, with respect to which it is probable that significant reversal will not occur. Our future financial statements will include additional disclosures as required by ASU 2014-09.\nReal Estate Charges\nSince 2010, in connection with our workforce reductions and in an effort to reduce our global real estate footprint, we have implemented a global office space consolidation. As a result, we have sub-leased over one million square feet of office space.\nDuring 2015, we recorded pre-tax real estate charges of $1.0 million, resulting from a change in estimates related to previously recorded real estate charges.\nDuring 2016, we recorded pre-tax real estate charges of $17.7 million, resulting from new charges of $22.8 million relating to the further consolidation of office space at our New York offices, offset by changes in estimates related to previously recorded real estate charges of $5.1 million, which reflected the shortening of the lease term of our corporate headquarters from 2029 to 2024.\nDuring 2017, we recorded pre-tax real estate charges of $36.7 million, resulting from new charges of $40.2 million primarily relating to the further consolidation of office space at our New York offices, offset by changes in estimates pertaining to previously recorded real estate charges of $3.5 million.\nUnits Outstanding\nEach quarter, we consider whether to implement a plan to repurchase AB Holding Units pursuant to Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act\u201d). A plan of this type allows a company to repurchase its shares at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so because of self-imposed trading blackout periods or because it possesses material non-public information. Each broker we select has the authority under the terms and limitations specified in the plan to repurchase AB Holding Units on our behalf in accordance with the terms of the plan. Repurchases are\nsubject to regulations promulgated by the SEC as well as certain price, market volume and timing constraints specified in the plan. The plan adopted during the fourth quarter of 2017 expired at the close of business on February 12, 2018. We may adopt additional plans in the future to engage in open-market purchases of AB Holding Units to help fund anticipated obligations under our incentive compensation award program and for other corporate purposes.\nCash Distributions\nWe are required to distribute all of our Available Cash Flow, as defined in the AB Partnership Agreement, to our Unitholders and the General Partner. Available Cash Flow typically is the adjusted diluted net income per unit for the quarter multiplied by the number of general and limited partnership interests at the end of the quarter. In future periods, management anticipates that Available Cash Flow will continue to be based on adjusted diluted net income per unit, unless management determines, with concurrence of the Board of Directors, that one or more adjustments that are made for adjusted net income should not be made with respect to the Available Cash Flow calculation. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 for a description of Available Cash Flow.\nManagement Operating Metrics\nWe are providing the non-GAAP measures adjusted net revenues\u201d, adjusted operating income\u201d and adjusted operating margin\u201d because they are the principal operating metrics management uses in evaluating and comparing period-to-period operating performance. Management principally uses these metrics in evaluating performance because they present a clearer picture of our operating performance and allow management to see long-term trends without the distortion primarily caused by long-term incentive compensation-related mark-to-market adjustments, real estate consolidation charges and other adjustment items. Similarly, we believe that these management operating metrics help investors better understand the underlying trends in our results and, accordingly, provide a valuable perspective for investors.\nThese non-GAAP measures are provided in addition to, and not as substitutes for, net revenues, operating income and operating margin, and they may not be comparable to non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. Management uses both accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"US GAAP\") and non-GAAP measures in evaluating our financial performance. The non-GAAP measures alone may pose limitations because they do not include all of our revenues and expenses.\n\nAdjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $125.7 million, or 20.1%, from the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to higher investment advisory base fees of $207.9 million and higher performance-based fees of $72.4 million, offset by higher employee compensation expenses (excluding the impact of long-term incentive compensation-related items) of $76.7 million, higher general and administrative expenses of $32.2 million, lower Bernstein Research Services revenue of $30.0 million and higher net distribution expenses of $12.0 million. Adjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $5.8 million, or 0.9%, from the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to lower employee compensation expense (excluding the impact of long-term incentive compensation-related items) of $42.1 million, lower promotion and servicing expenses of $14.1 million, higher performance-based fees of $9.1 million and lower general and administrative expenses of $6.9 million, offset by lower investment advisory base fees of $46.4 million, lower Bernstein Research Services revenue of $13.6 million and higher net distribution expenses of $13.1 million.\nAdjusted Net Revenues\nAdjusted net revenues exclude investment gains and losses and dividends and interest on employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments. In addition, adjusted net revenues offset distribution-related payments to third parties as well as amortization of deferred sales commissions against distribution revenues. We believe offsetting net revenues by distribution-related payments is useful for our investors and other users of our financial statements because such presentation appropriately reflects the nature of these costs as pass-through payments to third parties who perform functions on behalf of our sponsored mutual funds and/or shareholders of these funds. We offset amortization of deferred sales commissions against net revenues because such costs, over time, essentially offset our distribution revenues. We also exclude additional pass-through expenses we incur (primarily through our transfer agency) that are reimbursed and recorded as fees in revenues. These fees do not affect operating income, but they do affect our operating margin. As such, we exclude these fees from adjusted net revenues.\nWe adjust for the revenue impact of consolidating company-sponsored investment funds by eliminating the consolidated company-sponsored investment funds' revenues and including AB's fees from such consolidated company-sponsored investment funds and AB's investment gains and losses on its investments in such consolidated company-sponsored investment funds that were eliminated in consolidation. In addition, in 2017 we excluded a cumulative realized gain of $4.6 million on the exchange of software technology for an ownership stake in a third party provider of financial market data and trading tools and in 2016 we excluded a realized gain of $75.3 million resulting from the liquidation of an investment in Jasper Wireless Technologies, Inc. (\"Jasper\"), which was acquired by Cisco Systems, Inc., because these transactions are not part of our core operating results. Lastly, we exclude 90% of the investment gains and losses of our consolidated venture capital fund attributable to non-controlling interests.\nAdjusted Operating Income\nAdjusted operating income represents operating income on a US GAAP basis excluding (1) the impact on net revenues and compensation expense of the investment gains and losses (as well as the dividends and interest) associated with employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments, (2) the gain on the sale of our investment in Jasper in 2016, (3) the gain on the sale of software technology during 2017, (4) real estate charges, (5) acquisition-related expenses, (6) adjustments to contingent payment arrangements, and (7) the impact of consolidated company-sponsored investment funds.\nPrior to 2009, a significant portion of employee compensation was in the form of employee long-term incentive compensation awards that were notionally invested in AB investment services and generally vested over a period of four years. AB economically hedged the exposure to market movements by purchasing and holding these investments on its balance sheet. All such investments had vested as of year-end 2012 and the investments have been delivered to the participants, except for those investments with respect to which the participant elected a long-term deferral. Fluctuation in the value of these investments is recorded within investment gains and losses on the income statement and also impacts compensation expense. Management believes it is useful to reflect the offset achieved from economically hedging the market exposure of these investments in the calculation of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin. The non-GAAP measures exclude gains and losses and dividends and interest on employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments included in revenues and compensation expense.\nA realized gain on the liquidation of our Jasper investment during 2016 has been excluded due to its non-recurring nature and because it is not part of our core operating results.\nA realized gain on the exchange of software technology for an ownership stake in a third party company during 2017 has been excluded due to its non-recurring nature and because it is not part of our core operating results.\nReal estate charges have been excluded because they are not considered part of our core operating results when comparing financial results from period to period and to industry peers.\nAcquisition-related expenses have been excluded because they are not considered part of our core operating results when comparing financial results from period to period and to industry peers.\nThe recording of changes in estimates of the contingent consideration payable with respect to contingent payment arrangements associated with our acquisitions are not considered part of our core operating results and, accordingly, have been excluded.\nWe adjusted for the operating income impact of consolidating certain company-sponsored investment funds by eliminating the consolidated company-sponsored funds' revenues and expenses and including AB's revenues and expenses that were eliminated in consolidation. We also excluded the limited partner interests we do not own.\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Net Income per AB Unit\nAs previously discussed, our quarterly distribution is typically our adjusted diluted net income per unit (which is derived from adjusted net income) for the quarter multiplied by the number of general and limited partnership interests at the end of the quarter. Adjusted income taxes, used in calculating adjusted net income, are calculated using the GAAP effective tax rate adjusted for non-GAAP income tax adjustments.\nAdjusted Operating Margin\nAdjusted operating margin allows us to monitor our financial performance and efficiency from period to period without the volatility noted above in our discussion of adjusted operating income and to compare our performance to industry peers on a basis that better reflects our performance in our core business. Adjusted operating margin is derived by dividing adjusted operating income by adjusted net revenues.\nNet Revenues\nThe components of net revenues are as follows:\n\nInvestment Advisory and Services Fees\nInvestment advisory and services fees are the largest component of our revenues. These fees generally are calculated as a percentage of the value of AUM as of a specified date, or as a percentage of the value of average AUM for the applicable billing period, and vary with the type of investment service, the size of account and the total amount of assets we manage for a particular client. Accordingly, fee income generally increases or decreases as AUM increase or decrease and is affected by market appreciation or depreciation, the addition of new client accounts or client contributions of additional assets to existing accounts, withdrawals of assets from and termination of client accounts, purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares,\nshifts of assets between accounts or products with different fee structures, and acquisitions. Our average basis points realized (investment advisory and services fees divided by average AUM) generally approximate 40 to 110 basis points for actively-managed equity services, 10 to 75 basis points for actively-managed fixed income services and 2 to 20 basis points for passively-managed services. Average basis points realized for other services range from 5 basis points for certain Institutional asset allocation services to over 100 basis points for certain Retail and Private Wealth Management alternative services. These ranges include all-inclusive fee arrangements (covering investment management, trade execution and other services) for our Private Wealth Management clients.\nWe calculate AUM using established market-based valuation methods and fair valuation (non-observable market) methods. Market-based valuation methods include: last sale/settle prices from an exchange for actively-traded listed equities, options and futures; evaluated bid prices from recognized pricing vendors for fixed income, asset-backed or mortgage-backed issues; mid prices from recognized pricing vendors and brokers for credit default swaps; and quoted bids or spreads from pricing vendors and brokers for other derivative products. Fair valuation methods include: discounted cash flow models, evaluation of assets versus liabilities or any other methodology that is validated and approved by our Valuation Committee (see paragraph immediately below for more information regarding our Valuation Committee). Fair valuation methods are used only where AUM cannot be valued using market-based valuation methods, such as in the case of private equity or illiquid securities.\nThe Valuation Committee, which consists of senior officers and employees, is responsible for overseeing the pricing and valuation of all investments held in client and AB portfolios. The Valuation Committee has adopted a Statement of Pricing Policies describing principles and policies that apply to pricing and valuing investments held in these portfolios. We also have a Pricing Group, which reports to the Valuation Committee and is responsible for overseeing the pricing process for all investments.\nWe sometimes charge our clients performance-based fees. In these situations, we charge a base advisory fee and are eligible to earn an additional performance-based fee or incentive allocation that is calculated as either a percentage of absolute investment results or a percentage of investment results in excess of a stated benchmark over a specified period of time. Some performance-based fees include a high-watermark provision, which generally provides that if a client account underperforms relative to its performance target (whether absolute or relative to a specified benchmark), it must gain back such underperformance before we can collect future performance-based fees. Therefore, if we fail to achieve our performance target for a particular period, we will not earn a performance-based fee for that period and, for accounts with a high-watermark provision, our ability to earn future performance-based fees will be impaired. We are eligible to earn performance-based fees on 7.1%, 4.1% and 0.7% of the assets we manage for institutional clients, private wealth clients and retail clients, respectively (in total, 4.4% of our AUM).\nDuring 2016 and 2017, we received carried interest distributions of $77.8 million, as general partner of our real estate fund. In accordance with our current revenue recognition policies, we did not recognize these carried interest distributions as performance-based fee revenues, instead recording a deferred revenue liability, because the distributions are subject to claw-back provisions. In addition, we have revenue-sharing arrangements whereby certain employees are entitled to a share of carried interest proceeds distributed by certain funds, including the real estate fund. As such, we distributed $42.7 million of these carried interest proceeds to certain real estate fund employees. We have recorded this payment, which, like our carried interest distribution, is subject to claw-back provisions, as an advance to employees and will recognize it as compensation expense in the period in which the applicable revenue is recognized. Currently, we expect the net effect of these items to be included in the cumulative effect of initial adoption of ASU 2014-09 as of January 1, 2018. See Revenue Recognition previously discussed.\nOur investment advisory and services fees increased by $266.9 million, or 13.8%, in 2017, primarily due to a $204.9 million, or 10.8%, increase in base fees, which primarily resulted from a 7.9% increase in average AUM and the impact of a shift in distribution channel mix from Institutions to Retail and Private Wealth Management. Also, performance-based fees increased by $62.0 million. Our investment advisory and services fees decreased by $40.4 million, or 2.0%, in 2016, primarily due to a $49.4 million, or 2.5%, decrease in base fees, which primarily resulted from the impact of a shift in product mix from active equity products to active fixed income products, which generally have lower fees. However, our performance-based fees increased $9.0 million from the prior year.\nInstitutional investment advisory and services fees increased $53.8 million, or 12.8%, in 2017, primarily due to an increase in base fees of $26.0 million, or 6.5%, primarily resulting from a 4.3% increase in average AUM and the impact of a shift in product mix to active equities, which generally have higher fees. In addition, performance-based fees increased by $27.8 million. Institutional investment advisory and services fees decreased $13.6 million, or 3.1%, in 2016, primarily due to an $18.5 million, or 4.4%, decrease in base fees. The decrease in base fees resulted from a shift in product mix from active equities to active fixed income products, which generally have lower fees. However, performance-based fees increased $4.9 million from the prior year.\nRetail investment advisory and services fees increased $137.8 million, or 17.0%, in 2017, primarily due to an increase in base fees of $116.9 million, or 14.5%, primarily resulting from a 12.6% increase in average AUM and higher fee rate realization. In addition, performance-based fees increased by $20.9 million. Retail investment advisory and services fees decreased $47.1 million, or 5.5%, in 2016, primarily due to a $41.6 million, or 4.9%, decrease in base fees. The decrease in base fees was due to a decrease in average AUM of 1.8% and the impact of a shift in product mix from non-U.S. global fixed income mutual funds, non-U.S. global equity mutual funds and other products to U.S. tax-exempt mutual funds, which generally have lower fees. Additionally, performance-based fees decreased $5.5 million from the prior year.\nPrivate Wealth Management investment advisory and services fees increased by $75.4 million, or 10.7%, in 2017, due to an increase in base fees of $62.0 million, or 9.0%, primarily resulting from a 9.8% increase in average AUM. In addition, performance-based fees increased $13.4 million. Private Wealth Management investment advisory and services fees increased $20.3 million, or 3.0%, in 2016, due to an increase in base fees of $10.7 million, or 1.6%, resulting from a 2.2% increase in average AUM and a $9.6 million increase in performance-based fees.\nBernstein Research Services\nWe earn revenues for providing investment research to, and executing brokerage transactions for, institutional clients. These clients compensate us principally by directing us to execute brokerage transactions on their behalf, for which we earn commissions, and to a lesser extent by paying us directly for research through commission sharing agreements or cash payments.\nRevenues from Bernstein Research Services decreased $30.0 million, or 6.2%, in 2017. The decrease was driven by a decline in client activity in the U.S. and a volume mix shift to electronic trading in Europe. The decrease was partially offset by increased client activity in Asia and a weaker U.S. dollar year-over-year. Revenues from Bernstein Research Services decreased $13.6 million, or 2.8%, in 2016, as a result of lower market values and volumes in Europe and Asia and the discontinuation of our Equity Capital Market services.\nDistribution Revenues\nTwo of our subsidiaries act as distributors and/or placement agents of company-sponsored mutual funds and receive distribution services fees from certain of those funds as partial reimbursement of the distribution expenses they incur. Period-over-period fluctuations of distribution revenues typically are in line with fluctuations of the corresponding average AUM of these mutual funds.\nDistribution revenues increased $27.7 million, or 7.2%, in 2017, primarily due to the corresponding average AUM of these mutual funds increasing 11.2%, offset by the impact of a shift in product mix. During 2017, average AUM of A-share mutual funds (which have lower distribution fee rates than B-share and C-share mutual funds) increased 21.5%, while average AUM of B-share and C-share mutual funds decreased by 13.5%. Distribution revenues decreased $42.8 million, or 10.0%, in 2016, while the corresponding average AUM of these mutual funds decreased 8.0%.\nDividend and Interest Income and Interest Expense\nDividend and interest income consists primarily of investment income and interest earned on customer margin balances and U.S. Treasury Bills as well as dividend and interest income in our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. Interest expense principally reflects interest accrued on cash balances in customers' brokerage accounts. Dividend and interest income, net of interest expense, increased $8.2 million, or 21.6%, in 2017,", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nPercentage change figures are calculated using assets under management rounded to the nearest million and financial statement amounts rounded to the nearest thousand.\nExecutive Overview\nOur total assets under management ( AUM\u201d) as of December 31, 2017 were $554.5 billion, up $74.3 billion, or 15.5%, during 2017. The increase was driven by market appreciation of $61.1 billion and net inflows of $13.2 billion (primarily due to Retail and Institutional inflows of $8.9 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively).\nInstitutional AUM increased $30.0 billion, or 12.5%, to $269.3 billion during 2017, due to market appreciation of $26.4 billion and net inflows of $3.6 billion. Gross sales decreased $8.2 billion, or 38.1%, from $21.6 billion in 2016 to $13.4 billion in 2017. Redemptions and terminations decreased $4.2 billion, or 27.3%, from $15.7 billion in 2016 to $11.5 billion in 2017.\nRetail AUM increased $32.7 billion, or 20.5%, to $192.9 billion during 2017, due to market appreciation of $23.8 billion and net inflows of $8.9 billion. Gross sales increased $12.6 billion, or 30.5%, from $41.2 billion in 2016 to $53.8 billion in 2017. Redemptions and terminations decreased $2.2 billion, or 5.4%, from $40.8 billion in 2016 to $38.6 billion in 2017.\nPrivate Wealth Management AUM increased $11.6 billion, or 14.2%, to $92.3 billion during 2017, due to market appreciation of $10.9 billion and net inflows of $0.7 billion. Gross sales increased $1.3 billion, or 13.2%, from $10.2 billion in 2016 to $11.5 billion in 2017. Redemptions and terminations increased $1.3 billion, or 14.2%, from $9.3 billion in 2016 to $10.6 billion in 2017.\nBernstein Research Services revenue decreased $30.0 million, or 6.2%, in 2017. The decrease was driven by a decline in client activity in the U.S. and a volume mix shift to electronic trading in Europe. The decrease was partially offset by increased client activity in Asia and a weaker U.S. dollar year-over-year.\nOur 2017 revenues of $3.3 billion increased $0.3 billion, or 8.9%, compared to the prior year's net revenues of $3.0 billion. The most significant contributors to the increase were higher base advisory fees of $204.9 million, higher performance-based fees of $62.0 million and higher distribution revenues of $27.7 million, offset by lower Bernstein Research Services revenue of $30.0 million. Our operating expenses of $2.5 billion increased $0.2 billion, or 9.5%, compared to the prior year's expenses of $2.3 billion. The increase primarily was due to higher employee compensation and benefits of $83.7 million, higher general and administrative expenses (excluding real estate charges) of $55.3 million, higher promotion and servicing expenses of $35.4 million, lower adjustments to contingent payment arrangements of $20.5 million and higher real estate charges of $19.0 million. Our operating income increased $50.7 million, or 7.0%, to $773.9 million from $723.2 million in 2016 and our operating margin decreased from 23.2% in 2016 to 21.7% in 2017 as higher expenses outpaced revenue growth.\nMarket Environment\nGlobal equity markets increased substantially in 2017, and fixed income markets rose as well, as the global recovery gained momentum and breadth throughout the year. For the first time in the past five years, non-U.S. stocks outperformed U.S. stocks, aided by a weaker dollar, and credit spreads tightened in a risk-on\u201d environment. After an uncertain and volatile 2016, U.S. market volatility was exceptionally low in 2017. While 2018 got off to a strong start, U.S. equity markets began to vacillate wildly in February, and volatility surged as a result of a sharp rise in investor concern over the pace of interest rate hikes and the chances of rising inflation, which could slow economic growth. These stresses created uncertainty across global markets as well.\nDespite the strong run in the global markets, inflation so far remains low and Central Banks' monetary policies continue to vary among developed and emerging markets. In the U.S., three interest rate increases occurred during 2017 and several more are predicted for 2018, particularly if the economy continues to exhibit low unemployment, ongoing growth and emerging evidence of rising inflation. It remains to be seen how new tax legislation enacted in December 2017 will affect the U.S. economy going forward. In Europe, which is earlier in its economic recovery than the U.S., asset purchases by the European Central Bank are expected to end in 2018, Brexit negotiations are ongoing and MiFID II went into effect at the start of 2018. And in China, with the pace of growth slowing, quality\u201d of growth is increasing in importance.\nThe challenges for active fund managers continued in 2017. While their investment performance improved on average in 2017, they still struggled to attract net new assets in the face of ongoing overwhelming demand for passive equity strategies and accelerating demand for passive fixed income strategies. In the U.S., where the shift from active to passive has been most prevalent, total industry-wide active mutual fund flows turned positive in 2017, with $56 billion, on strength in fixed income and international equity services. Active U.S. equity mutual funds, however, still sustained $201 billion in outflows for the year,\neven though the percentage of outperforming active equity managers increased to 50%, versus 26% in 2016 and a long-term average of 34%. Meanwhile, total passive inflows continued to accelerate in 2017 and reached an all-time high of $692 billion.\nMiFID II\nThe second installment of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II ( MiFID II\u201d), which became effective January 3, 2018, makes significant modifications to the manner in which European broker-dealers can be compensated for research. These modifications are recognized in the industry as having the potential to significantly decrease the overall research spend by European buy-side firms. Consequently, our U.K.-based broker-dealer is considering new charging mechanisms for its research in order to minimize this impact as part of its broader MiFID II implementation program. It is important to note, however, that our new charging techniques and other strategic decisions to address the new environment created by MiFID II may not be successful, which could result in a significant decline in our sell-side revenues.\nAlso, although MiFID II does permit buy-side firms to purchase research through the use of client-funded research payment accounts, most buy-side firms that operate in the Eurozone, including our U.K. buy-side subsidiaries, have decided to use their own funds to pay for research in the Eurozone. This change in practice will increase our expenses in the Eurozone and, if this practice becomes more pervasive globally, it may have a significant adverse effect on our net income in future periods.\nThe ultimate impact of MiFID II on payments for research globally currently is uncertain.\nAXA Equitable Holdings IPO\nOn May 10, 2017, AXA S.A. ( AXA\u201d) announced its intention to sell and list for trading a minority stake of its U.S. operations (expected to consist of AXA's U.S. Life & Savings business and its interest in AB) during the first half of 2018, subject to market conditions and SEC review process. While we cannot at this time predict the eventual impact, if any, on AB of this proposed transaction, it could include a reduction in the support AXA has provided to AB in the past with respect to AB's investment management business, resulting in a decrease to our revenues and ability to initiate new investment services. Also, AB relies on AXA for a number of significant services and benefits from its affiliation with AXA in certain common vendor relationships. These arrangements also may change with possible negative financial implications for AB.\nRelocation Strategy\nDuring 2017, we began exploring several U.S. cities for the purpose of establishing a second principal U.S. location. We intend to transition a significant number of our staff located in our New York metro offices to this new location once we have finalized the city and secured office space. The transition period is expected to last a number of years. We will continue to maintain an employee presence in New York City, which will remain a principal location.\nWe believe a second principal location will afford us the opportunity to provide an improved quality of life alternative for our employees, enable us to attract and recruit new talented employees to a highly desirable location while improving the long-term cost structure of the firm. However, we expect to incur potentially material costs through the transition period, including relocation, severance, and duplicative compensation and occupancy costs, before realizing ongoing cost savings. We currently are unable to estimate either the transitional costs or the ongoing cost savings as we have not yet completed our search process or finalized the scale of our relocation strategy.\nAdjusted Operating Margin Target\nWe have adopted a goal of increasing our adjusted operating margin from 27.7% (which we achieved for 2017) to a target of 30% by 2020 (the 2020 Margin Target\u201d), subject to the assumptions, factors and contingencies discussed below.\nActual results related to this target may vary depending on various factors, including capital market outcomes, the global regulatory environment in which we operate, the performance of our investment services, the net flows experienced by our investment services and the successful management of our costs. Also, the anticipated establishment of a second principal location outside of the New York City metropolitan area, which is described immediately above, will likely involve substantial transitional costs, including employee relocation, severance, recruitment and duplicative compensation and occupancy costs. We currently are unable to estimate precisely these interim transitional costs or the expected ongoing cost savings, or the timing of these costs and savings, as we have not yet completed our search process or finalized the scale of our relocation strategy. If the transitional costs we incur in 2019 and 2020 significantly exceed any cost savings we realize in those years from our relocation strategy, our actual adjusted operating margin for 2020 will be adversely affected and, as a result, we may not reach the 2020 Margin Target.\nIn setting our 2020 Margin Target, we have made significant assumptions with respect to, among other things:\n \u2022 the levels of positive net flows into our investment services; \n \u2022 the level of growth (in terms of additional AUM) in our alternatives product business; \n \u2022 the rate of increase in our fixed costs due to inflation and similar factors, the transitional costs related to our relocation strategy and the timing of such costs, the success we have in achieving planned new cost reductions (including those relating to our relocation strategy) and the timing of such cost reductions, and the investments we make in our business; and \n \u2022 general conditions of the markets in which our business operates, including modest continued appreciation in both equity and fixed income total investment returns. \nWhile our 2020 Margin Target is presented with numerical specificity, and we believe the target to be reasonable as of the date of this report, the uncertainties surrounding the assumptions we discuss above create a significant risk that these assumptions may not be realized. Accordingly, our 2020 Margin Target may not be achieved, particularly if actual events adversely differ from one or more of our key assumptions. The 2020 Margin Target and its underlying assumptions are Forward-Looking Statements and can be affected by any of the factors discussed in Risk Factors\u201d and Cautions Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this 10-K. We strongly caution investors not to place undue reliance on any of these assumptions or our 2020 Margin Target. Except as may be required by applicable securities laws, we are not under any obligation, and we expressly disclaim any obligation, to update or alter any assumptions, estimates, financial goals, targets, projections or other related statements that we may make.\nAssets Under Management\nAssets under management by distribution channel are as follows:\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td>

We adopted this new accounting standard on January 1, 2018 on a modified retrospective basis, recognizing the cumulative effect of initial adoption in Partners' Capital. Based on our analysis performed to-date, we do not expect any changes in the timing of revenue recognition for our base fees, distribution revenues, shareholder servicing revenues and broker-dealer revenues. However, performance-based fees, which are currently recognized at the end of the applicable measurement period when no risk of reversal remains, and carried-interest distributions received (considered performance-based fees), which are currently recorded as deferred revenues until no risk of reversal remains, may in certain instances be recognized earlier under the new standard, if it is probable that significant reversal of performance-based fees recognized will not occur. Currently, we expect the cumulative effect of initial adoption in partners' capital as of January 1, 2018 to be approximately $35 million. This amount represents carried-interest distributions previously received, net of revenue sharing payments to investment team members, with respect to which it is probable that significant reversal will not occur. Our future financial statements will include additional disclosures as required by ASU 2014-09.\nReal Estate Charges\nSince 2010, in connection with our workforce reductions and in an effort to reduce our global real estate footprint, we have implemented a global office space consolidation. As a result, we have sub-leased over one million square feet of office space.\nDuring 2015, we recorded pre-tax real estate charges of $1.0 million, resulting from a change in estimates related to previously recorded real estate charges.\nDuring 2016, we recorded pre-tax real estate charges of $17.7 million, resulting from new charges of $22.8 million relating to the further consolidation of office space at our New York offices, offset by changes in estimates related to previously recorded real estate charges of $5.1 million, which reflected the shortening of the lease term of our corporate headquarters from 2029 to 2024.\nDuring 2017, we recorded pre-tax real estate charges of $36.7 million, resulting from new charges of $40.2 million primarily relating to the further consolidation of office space at our New York offices, offset by changes in estimates pertaining to previously recorded real estate charges of $3.5 million.\nUnits Outstanding\nEach quarter, we consider whether to implement a plan to repurchase AB Holding Units pursuant to Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act\u201d). A plan of this type allows a company to repurchase its shares at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so because of self-imposed trading blackout periods or because it possesses material non-public information. Each broker we select has the authority under the terms and limitations specified in the plan to repurchase AB Holding Units on our behalf in accordance with the terms of the plan. Repurchases are\nsubject to regulations promulgated by the SEC as well as certain price, market volume and timing constraints specified in the plan. The plan adopted during the fourth quarter of 2017 expired at the close of business on February 12, 2018. We may adopt additional plans in the future to engage in open-market purchases of AB Holding Units to help fund anticipated obligations under our incentive compensation award program and for other corporate purposes.\nCash Distributions\nWe are required to distribute all of our Available Cash Flow, as defined in the AB Partnership Agreement, to our Unitholders and the General Partner. Available Cash Flow typically is the adjusted diluted net income per unit for the quarter multiplied by the number of general and limited partnership interests at the end of the quarter. In future periods, management anticipates that Available Cash Flow will continue to be based on adjusted diluted net income per unit, unless management determines, with concurrence of the Board of Directors, that one or more adjustments that are made for adjusted net income should not be made with respect to the Available Cash Flow calculation. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 for a description of Available Cash Flow.\nManagement Operating Metrics\nWe are providing the non-GAAP measures adjusted net revenues\u201d, adjusted operating income\u201d and adjusted operating margin\u201d because they are the principal operating metrics management uses in evaluating and comparing period-to-period operating performance. Management principally uses these metrics in evaluating performance because they present a clearer picture of our operating performance and allow management to see long-term trends without the distortion primarily caused by long-term incentive compensation-related mark-to-market adjustments, real estate consolidation charges and other adjustment items. Similarly, we believe that these management operating metrics help investors better understand the underlying trends in our results and, accordingly, provide a valuable perspective for investors.\nThese non-GAAP measures are provided in addition to, and not as substitutes for, net revenues, operating income and operating margin, and they may not be comparable to non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. Management uses both accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"US GAAP\") and non-GAAP measures in evaluating our financial performance. The non-GAAP measures alone may pose limitations because they do not include all of our revenues and expenses.\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to higher investment advisory base fees of $207.9 million and higher performance-based fees of $72.4 million, offset by higher employee compensation expenses (excluding the impact of long-term incentive compensation-related items) of $76.7 million, higher general and administrative expenses of $32.2 million, lower Bernstein Research Services revenue of $30.0 million and higher net distribution expenses of $12.0 million. Adjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $5.8 million, or 0.9%, from the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to lower employee compensation expense (excluding the impact of long-term incentive compensation-related items) of $42.1 million, lower promotion and servicing expenses of $14.1 million, higher performance-based fees of $9.1 million and lower general and administrative expenses of $6.9 million, offset by lower investment advisory base fees of $46.4 million, lower Bernstein Research Services revenue of $13.6 million and higher net distribution expenses of $13.1 million.\nAdjusted Net Revenues\nAdjusted net revenues exclude investment gains and losses and dividends and interest on employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments. In addition, adjusted net revenues offset distribution-related payments to third parties as well as amortization of deferred sales commissions against distribution revenues. We believe offsetting net revenues by distribution-related payments is useful for our investors and other users of our financial statements because such presentation appropriately reflects the nature of these costs as pass-through payments to third parties who perform functions on behalf of our sponsored mutual funds and/or shareholders of these funds. We offset amortization of deferred sales commissions against net revenues because such costs, over time, essentially offset our distribution revenues. We also exclude additional pass-through expenses we incur (primarily through our transfer agency) that are reimbursed and recorded as fees in revenues. These fees do not affect operating income, but they do affect our operating margin. As such, we exclude these fees from adjusted net revenues.\nWe adjust for the revenue impact of consolidating company-sponsored investment funds by eliminating the consolidated company-sponsored investment funds' revenues and including AB's fees from such consolidated company-sponsored investment funds and AB's investment gains and losses on its investments in such consolidated company-sponsored investment funds that were eliminated in consolidation. In addition, in 2017 we excluded a cumulative realized gain of $4.6 million on the exchange of software technology for an ownership stake in a third party provider of financial market data and trading tools and in 2016 we excluded a realized gain of $75.3 million resulting from the liquidation of an investment in Jasper Wireless Technologies, Inc. (\"Jasper\"), which was acquired by Cisco Systems, Inc., because these transactions are not part of our core operating results. Lastly, we exclude 90% of the investment gains and losses of our consolidated venture capital fund attributable to non-controlling interests.\nAdjusted Operating Income\nAdjusted operating income represents operating income on a US GAAP basis excluding (1) the impact on net revenues and compensation expense of the investment gains and losses (as well as the dividends and interest) associated with employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments, (2) the gain on the sale of our investment in Jasper in 2016, (3) the gain on the sale of software technology during 2017, (4) real estate charges, (5) acquisition-related expenses, (6) adjustments to contingent payment arrangements, and (7) the impact of consolidated company-sponsored investment funds.\nPrior to 2009, a significant portion of employee compensation was in the form of employee long-term incentive compensation awards that were notionally invested in AB investment services and generally vested over a period of four years. AB economically hedged the exposure to market movements by purchasing and holding these investments on its balance sheet. All such investments had vested as of year-end 2012 and the investments have been delivered to the participants, except for those investments with respect to which the participant elected a long-term deferral. Fluctuation in the value of these investments is recorded within investment gains and losses on the income statement and also impacts compensation expense. Management believes it is useful to reflect the offset achieved from economically hedging the market exposure of these investments in the calculation of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin. The non-GAAP measures exclude gains and losses and dividends and interest on employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments included in revenues and compensation expense.\nA realized gain on the liquidation of our Jasper investment during 2016 has been excluded due to its non-recurring nature and because it is not part of our core operating results.\nA realized gain on the exchange of software technology for an ownership stake in a third party company during 2017 has been excluded due to its non-recurring nature and because it is not part of our core operating results.\nReal estate charges have been excluded because they are not considered part of our core operating results when comparing financial results from period to period and to industry peers.\nAcquisition-related expenses have been excluded because they are not considered part of our core operating results when comparing financial results from period to period and to industry peers.\nThe recording of changes in estimates of the contingent consideration payable with respect to contingent payment arrangements associated with our acquisitions are not considered part of our core operating results and, accordingly, have been excluded.\nWe adjusted for the operating income impact of consolidating certain company-sponsored investment funds by eliminating the consolidated company-sponsored funds' revenues and expenses and including AB's revenues and expenses that were eliminated in consolidation. We also excluded the limited partner interests we do not own.\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Net Income per AB Unit\nAs previously discussed, our quarterly distribution is typically our adjusted diluted net income per unit (which is derived from adjusted net income) for the quarter multiplied by the number of general and limited partnership interests at the end of the quarter. Adjusted income taxes, used in calculating adjusted net income, are calculated using the GAAP effective tax rate adjusted for non-GAAP income tax adjustments.\nAdjusted Operating Margin\nAdjusted operating margin allows us to monitor our financial performance and efficiency from period to period without the volatility noted above in our discussion of adjusted operating income and to compare our performance to industry peers on a basis that better reflects our performance in our core business. Adjusted operating margin is derived by dividing adjusted operating income by adjusted net revenues.\nNet Revenues\nThe components of net revenues are as follows:\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td>

These fees generally are calculated as a percentage of the value of AUM as of a specified date, or as a percentage of the value of average AUM for the applicable billing period, and vary with the type of investment service, the size of account and the total amount of assets we manage for a particular client. Accordingly, fee income generally increases or decreases as AUM increase or decrease and is affected by market appreciation or depreciation, the addition of new client accounts or client contributions of additional assets to existing accounts, withdrawals of assets from and termination of client accounts, purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares,\nshifts of assets between accounts or products with different fee structures, and acquisitions. Our average basis points realized (investment advisory and services fees divided by average AUM) generally approximate 40 to 110 basis points for actively-managed equity services, 10 to 75 basis points for actively-managed fixed income services and 2 to 20 basis points for passively-managed services. Average basis points realized for other services range from 5 basis points for certain Institutional asset allocation services to over 100 basis points for certain Retail and Private Wealth Management alternative services. These ranges include all-inclusive fee arrangements (covering investment management, trade execution and other services) for our Private Wealth Management clients.\nWe calculate AUM using established market-based valuation methods and fair valuation (non-observable market) methods. Market-based valuation methods include: last sale/settle prices from an exchange for actively-traded listed equities, options and futures; evaluated bid prices from recognized pricing vendors for fixed income, asset-backed or mortgage-backed issues; mid prices from recognized pricing vendors and brokers for credit default swaps; and quoted bids or spreads from pricing vendors and brokers for other derivative products. Fair valuation methods include: discounted cash flow models, evaluation of assets versus liabilities or any other methodology that is validated and approved by our Valuation Committee (see paragraph immediately below for more information regarding our Valuation Committee). Fair valuation methods are used only where AUM cannot be valued using market-based valuation methods, such as in the case of private equity or illiquid securities.\nThe Valuation Committee, which consists of senior officers and employees, is responsible for overseeing the pricing and valuation of all investments held in client and AB portfolios. The Valuation Committee has adopted a Statement of Pricing Policies describing principles and policies that apply to pricing and valuing investments held in these portfolios. We also have a Pricing Group, which reports to the Valuation Committee and is responsible for overseeing the pricing process for all investments.\nWe sometimes charge our clients performance-based fees. In these situations, we charge a base advisory fee and are eligible to earn an additional performance-based fee or incentive allocation that is calculated as either a percentage of absolute investment results or a percentage of investment results in excess of a stated benchmark over a specified period of time. Some performance-based fees include a high-watermark provision, which generally provides that if a client account underperforms relative to its performance target (whether absolute or relative to a specified benchmark), it must gain back such underperformance before we can collect future performance-based fees. Therefore, if we fail to achieve our performance target for a particular period, we will not earn a performance-based fee for that period and, for accounts with a high-watermark provision, our ability to earn future performance-based fees will be impaired. We are eligible to earn performance-based fees on 7.1%, 4.1% and 0.7% of the assets we manage for institutional clients, private wealth clients and retail clients, respectively (in total, 4.4% of our AUM).\nDuring 2016 and 2017, we received carried interest distributions of $77.8 million, as general partner of our real estate fund. In accordance with our current revenue recognition policies, we did not recognize these carried interest distributions as performance-based fee revenues, instead recording a deferred revenue liability, because the distributions are subject to claw-back provisions. In addition, we have revenue-sharing arrangements whereby certain employees are entitled to a share of carried interest proceeds distributed by certain funds, including the real estate fund. As such, we distributed $42.7 million of these carried interest proceeds to certain real estate fund employees. We have recorded this payment, which, like our carried interest distribution, is subject to claw-back provisions, as an advance to employees and will recognize it as compensation expense in the period in which the applicable revenue is recognized. Currently, we expect the net effect of these items to be included in the cumulative effect of initial adoption of ASU 2014-09 as of January 1, 2018. See Revenue Recognition previously discussed.\nOur investment advisory and services fees increased by $266.9 million, or 13.8%, in 2017, primarily due to a $204.9 million, or 10.8%, increase in base fees, which primarily resulted from a 7.9% increase in average AUM and the impact of a shift in distribution channel mix from Institutions to Retail and Private Wealth Management. Also, performance-based fees increased by $62.0 million. Our investment advisory and services fees decreased by $40.4 million, or 2.0%, in 2016, primarily due to a $49.4 million, or 2.5%, decrease in base fees, which primarily resulted from the impact of a shift in product mix from active equity products to active fixed income products, which generally have lower fees. However, our performance-based fees increased $9.0 million from the prior year.\nInstitutional investment advisory and services fees increased $53.8 million, or 12.8%, in 2017, primarily due to an increase in base fees of $26.0 million, or 6.5%, primarily resulting from a 4.3% increase in average AUM and the impact of a shift in product mix to active equities, which generally have higher fees. In addition, performance-based fees increased by $27.8 million. Institutional investment advisory and services fees decreased $13.6 million, or 3.1%, in 2016, primarily due to an $18.5 million, or 4.4%, decrease in base fees. The decrease in base fees resulted from a shift in product mix from active equities to active fixed income products, which generally have lower fees. However, performance-based fees increased $4.9 million from the prior year.\nRetail investment advisory and services fees increased $137.8 million, or 17.0%, in 2017, primarily due to an increase in base fees of $116.9 million, or 14.5%, primarily resulting from a 12.6% increase in average AUM and higher fee rate realization. In addition, performance-based fees increased by $20.9 million. Retail investment advisory and services fees decreased $47.1 million, or 5.5%, in 2016, primarily due to a $41.6 million, or 4.9%, decrease in base fees. The decrease in base fees was due to a decrease in average AUM of 1.8% and the impact of a shift in product mix from non-U.S. global fixed income mutual funds, non-U.S. global equity mutual funds and other products to U.S. tax-exempt mutual funds, which generally have lower fees. Additionally, performance-based fees decreased $5.5 million from the prior year.\nPrivate Wealth Management investment advisory and services fees increased by $75.4 million, or 10.7%, in 2017, due to an increase in base fees of $62.0 million, or 9.0%, primarily resulting from a 9.8% increase in average AUM. In addition, performance-based fees increased $13.4 million. Private Wealth Management investment advisory and services fees increased $20.3 million, or 3.0%, in 2016, due to an increase in base fees of $10.7 million, or 1.6%, resulting from a 2.2% increase in average AUM and a $9.6 million increase in performance-based fees.\nBernstein Research Services\nWe earn revenues for providing investment research to, and executing brokerage transactions for, institutional clients. These clients compensate us principally by directing us to execute brokerage transactions on their behalf, for which we earn commissions, and to a lesser extent by paying us directly for research through commission sharing agreements or cash payments.\nRevenues from Bernstein Research Services decreased $30.0 million, or 6.2%, in 2017. The decrease was driven by a decline in client activity in the U.S. and a volume mix shift to electronic trading in Europe. The decrease was partially offset by increased client activity in Asia and a weaker U.S. dollar year-over-year. Revenues from Bernstein Research Services decreased $13.6 million, or 2.8%, in 2016, as a result of lower market values and volumes in Europe and Asia and the discontinuation of our Equity Capital Market services.\nDistribution Revenues\nTwo of our subsidiaries act as distributors and/or placement agents of company-sponsored mutual funds and receive distribution services fees from certain of those funds as partial reimbursement of the distribution expenses they incur. Period-over-period fluctuations of distribution revenues typically are in line with fluctuations of the corresponding average AUM of these mutual funds.\nDistribution revenues increased $27.7 million, or 7.2%, in 2017, primarily due to the corresponding average AUM of these mutual funds increasing 11.2%, offset by the impact of a shift in product mix. During 2017, average AUM of A-share mutual funds (which have lower distribution fee rates than B-share and C-share mutual funds) increased 21.5%, while average AUM of B-share and C-share mutual funds decreased by 13.5%. Distribution revenues decreased $42.8 million, or 10.0%, in 2016, while the corresponding average AUM of these mutual funds decreased 8.0%.\nDividend and Interest Income and Interest Expense\nDividend and interest income consists primarily of investment income and interest earned on customer margin balances and U.S. Treasury Bills as well as dividend and interest income in our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. Interest expense principally reflects interest accrued on cash balances in customers' brokerage accounts. Dividend and interest income, net of interest expense, increased $8.2 million, or 21.6%, in 2017,"}
