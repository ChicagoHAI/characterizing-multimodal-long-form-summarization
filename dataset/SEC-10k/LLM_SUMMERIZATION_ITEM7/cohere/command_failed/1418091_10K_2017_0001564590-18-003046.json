MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplemental Data\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFY 2017 Overview and Highlights\nTotal revenue was $2.44 billion, a decrease of 3% compared to 2016.\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Advertising revenue totaled $2.11 billion, a decrease of 6% compared to 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Data licensing and other revenue totaled $333.3 million, an increase of 18% compared to 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> U.S. revenue totaled $1.41 billion, a decrease of 10% compared to 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> International revenue totaled $1.03 billion, an increase of 7% compared to 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Total ad engagements increased 96% year-over-year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Cost per engagement decreased 52% year-over-year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet loss was $108.1 million, a decrease of 76% compared to 2016.\nNon-GAAP net income was $328.9 million, an increase of 24% compared to 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $863.0 million, an increase of 15% compared to 2016.\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in marketable securities totaled $4.40 billion as of December 31, 2017.\nAverage monthly active users were 330 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 4% compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nAverage daily active usage for the three months ended December 31, 2017 grew 12% year-over-year.\nKey Metrics\nWe review a number of metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions.\nMonthly Active Users (MAUs). We define MAUs as Twitter users who logged in or were otherwise authenticated and accessed Twitter through our website, mobile website, desktop or mobile applications, SMS or registered third-party applications or websites in the 30-day period ending on the date of measurement. Average MAUs for a period represent the average of the MAUs at the end of each month during the period. MAUs are a measure of the size of our logged in or otherwise authenticated active user base. In the three months ended December 31, 2017, we had 330 million average MAUs, which represents an increase of 4% from the three months ended December 31, 2016(1). The growth in average MAUs was driven by a combination of organic growth, marketing, and product improvements, including the ongoing benefits of improved relevance in email, push notifications and the timeline. In the three months ended December 31, 2017, we had 68 million average MAUs in the United States and 262 million average MAUs in the rest of the world, which represent increases of 2% and 4%, respectively, from the three months ended December 31, 2016. For additional information on how we calculate MAUs and factors that can affect this metric, see the section titled Note Regarding Key Metrics.\u201d\nMAU growth is historically seasonally weak in the fourth quarter. In addition, a recent change was made to Safari's integration with third-party applications including Twitter that resulted in a decrease of approximately 2 million MAUs that accessed Twitter by using registered third-party applications when those applications automatically contact our servers for regular updates without discernible user-initiated action, which we refer to as third-party auto-polling MAU. However, we do not serve ads to this subset of MAUs and as a result, no revenue is generated from such MAUs. MAU in the fourth quarter was also impacted by increased information quality efforts, which are our overall efforts to reduce malicious activity on the service, inclusive of spam, malicious automation, and fake accounts.\nTable 187: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Reported average Monthly Active Users reflects adjustments for approximately 1-2 million users per quarter of certain third-party applications that were included as Twitter MAUs that should not have been considered MAUs in certain prior periods. Daily Active Usage was not affected. Further details regarding the adjustment can be found in the section titled \"Note About Our MAU Adjustment.\"\nNote About Our MAU Adjustment\nIn the third quarter of 2017, we discovered that since the fourth quarter of 2014 we had included users of certain third-party applications as Twitter MAUs that should not have been considered MAUs. These third-party applications used Digits, a software development kit of our now-divested Fabric platform, that allowed third-party applications to send authentication messages via SMS through our systems, which did not relate to activity on the Twitter platform. The table below presents the impact for the periods beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016. Due to our data retention policies, we do not have data to reconcile periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2016, but our estimates suggest the prior period adjustments are smaller than those in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nTable 188: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three Months Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three Months Ended March 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three Months Ended June 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Worldwide\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Worldwide\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Worldwide\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Previously Reported MAU\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustment (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted MAU\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (1) The difference between Adjusted MAU and Previously Reported MAU does not correspond to the amount of the Adjustment due to rounding.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nChanges in Daily Active Users/Daily Active Usage (DAU). We define daily active users or daily active usage as Twitter users who logged in or were otherwise authenticated and accessed Twitter through our website, mobile website or mobile applications on any given day. Average DAU for a period represents the number of DAUs on each day of such period divided by the number of days for such period. Changes in DAU are a measure of changes in the size of our daily logged in or otherwise authenticated active user base. To calculate the year-over-year change in DAUs, we subtract the average DAU for the three months ended in the previous year from the average DAU for the same three months ended in the current year and divide the result by the average DAU for the three months ended in the previous year. Prior to reporting results for the third quarter of 2016, we had discussed DAUs and the ratio of MAUs to DAUs. In those instances, for comparability and consistency with MAUs, DAUs also included users who accessed Twitter through our desktop applications and third-party properties. For additional information on how we calculate changes in DAUs and factors that can affect this metric, see the section titled Note Regarding Key Metrics.\u201d Reported DAU metrics were not impacted by the MAU adjustment discussed above as DAU do not include users from third-party applications.\nDAU grew faster than MAU in the fourth quarter of 2017 as we continued to benefit from organic growth, product and marketing investments made in this quarter and in prior periods.\nChanges in Ad Engagements and Cost per Ad Engagement. We define an ad engagement as a user interaction with one of our pay-for-performance advertising products. Ad engagements with our advertising products are based on a user completing an objective set out by an advertiser such as expanding, Retweeting, liking or replying to a Promoted Tweet, viewing an embedded video, downloading or engaging with a promoted mobile application, clicking on a website link, signing up for marketing emails from advertisers, following the account that tweets a Promoted Tweet, or completing a transaction on an external website. We believe changes in ad engagements is one way to measure user engagement with our advertising products. We believe changes in cost per ad engagement is one way to measure demand.\nIn the three months ended December 31, 2017, ad engagements increased 75% from the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase was driven by a continuing mix shift toward video ad impressions as well as higher click-through rates. In the three months ended December 31, 2017, average cost per ad engagement decreased 42% from the three months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in cost per ad engagement reflects a higher mix of video ad engagements (which have overall lower cost per ad engagement compared to other ad formats) and lower cost per ad engagement across the majority of ad formats compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFactors Affecting Our Future Performance\nUser Growth and Monetization. User growth trends reflected in the number of MAUs, changes in DAUs and monetization trends reflected in advertising engagements are key factors that affect our revenue. As our user base and the level of engagement of our users grow, we believe the potential to increase our revenue grows.\nUser Growth. We have generally experienced growth in our number of users over the last several years. In general, a higher proportion of Internet users in the United States use Twitter than Internet users in other countries. Accordingly, in the future we expect our user growth rate in certain international markets to continue to be higher than our user growth rate in the United States. However, we expect to face challenges in entering some markets, such as China, where access to Twitter is blocked, as well as certain other countries that have intermittently restricted access to Twitter. Restrictions or limitations on access to Twitter may adversely impact our ability to increase the size of our user base and generate additional revenue in certain markets.\nWe do not separately track whether an MAU has only used Twitter on a desktop or on a mobile device. However, in the three months ended December 31, 2017, approximately 80% of our average MAUs accessed Twitter from a mobile device, roughly stable from the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nWe may face challenges in increasing the size of our user base, including, among others, competition from alternative products and services, a decline in the number of influential users on Twitter or a perceived decline in the quality of content or user experience available on Twitter. We intend to drive growth in our user base by building and shipping product changes more rapidly to make Twitter safer and investing in our core use case and in new product areas - such as live streaming video, among others - that further strengthen our unique position as the best and fastest place to see and talk about what's happening in the world. Our user growth rate has fluctuated over time, and it may slow or decline. To the extent our logged-in user growth or user growth rate continues to slow or the absolute number of logged in users declines, our revenue growth will become dependent on our ability to increase levels of user engagement on Twitter and increasing revenue growth from third-party publishers' websites and applications, data licensing and other offerings.\nMonetization. There are many variables that impact the monetization of our platform, such as the number of users, our users' level of engagement with our platform, ad load (which is a function of the amount of advertising we choose to display), our users' engagement with our Promoted Products, advertiser demand and cost per ad engagement. Generally, we design our algorithms for our pay-for-performance Promoted Products on Twitter to optimize the overall user experience and the value we deliver to advertisers. Advertising revenue growth may be impacted by escalating competition for digital ad spending and the reevaluation of our revenue product feature portfolio, which could result in the de-emphasis of certain product features. Furthermore, we may see a continuing decline in the number of advertisers on a year-over-year basis, which may also impact overall demand for our ads products. We have, and may in the future, increase ad load to the extent that we are able to continue to reach the right balance of advertiser value and the overall user experience. In order to improve monetization, we plan to increase the value of our advertising services by continuing to increase the size and engagement of our user base as well as improve our ability to target advertising to our users' interests and the ability of our advertisers to optimize their campaigns and measure the results of their campaigns.\nAlthough the majority of the Promoted Products we sell to our advertisers are placed on Twitter, we have augmented our advertising revenue by selling to advertisers our advertising products that we place on third-party publishers' websites, applications or other offerings. For the latter category of advertising placements, we incur additional costs, particularly traffic acquisition costs, to fulfill our services to advertisers. As we deprecated our TellApart offering in 2017, we expect contributions from our advertising products that we place on third-party publishers' websites and applications to face significant headwinds in 2018. TellApart revenue was $44.6 million in 2017, mainly in the first half of 2017, compared to $126.4 million in 2016.\nWe intend to continue to increase the monetization of our platform by improving the targeting capabilities of our advertising services to enhance the value of our Promoted Products for advertisers, delivering differentiated products to advertisers, and developing new ad formats for advertisers.\nEffectiveness of Our Advertising Services. Advertisers can use Twitter to communicate directly with their followers for free, but many choose to purchase our advertising services to reach a broader audience and further promote their brands, products and services. We believe that increasing the effectiveness of our Promoted Products for advertisers, as well as providing better measurement tools and improving creative capabilities, will increase the amount that advertisers spend with us. We aim to increase the value of our Promoted Products by increasing the size and engagement of our user base, improving our ability to target advertising to our users' interests and improving the ability of our advertisers to optimize their campaigns and measure the results of their campaigns. We may also develop new advertising products and services.\nInvestment in International Operations. We intend to strategically invest in our international operations in order to expand our user base and advertiser base and increase user engagement and monetization internationally. In the three months ended December 31, 2017, we had 262 million average MAUs internationally compared to 68 million average MAUs in the United States. In addition, our number of users is growing at a faster rate in many international markets. However, we derive the majority of our advertising revenue from advertisers in the United States.\nWe face challenges in increasing our advertising revenue internationally, including local competition, differences in advertiser demand, differences in the digital advertising market and conventions, and differences in the manner in which Twitter is accessed and used internationally. We face competition from well-established competitors in certain international markets. In addition, certain international markets are not as familiar with digital advertising in general, or with new forms of digital advertising, such as our Promoted Products. In these jurisdictions we are investing to educate advertisers about the benefits of our advertising services. However, we expect that it may require a significant investment of time and resources to educate advertisers in many international markets. We also face challenges in providing certain advertising products, features or analytics in certain international markets, such as the European Union, due to government regulation. In addition, in certain emerging markets, a significant portion of users still access Twitter through feature phones with limited functionality, rather than through smartphones, our website or desktop applications. This limits our ability to deliver certain features to these users and may limit the ability of advertisers to deliver compelling ads to users in these markets.\nCompetition. We face competition for users and advertisers. We compete against many companies to attract and engage users and for advertiser spend, including companies with greater financial resources and substantially larger user bases which offer a variety of Internet and mobile device-based products, services and content. In recent years there has been a significant number of acquisitions and consolidation activity by and among our actual and potential competitors. We must compete effectively for users and advertisers in order to grow our business and increase our revenue. We believe that our ability to compete effectively for users depends upon a number of factors, including the quality of our products and services and the actual or perceived return our advertisers receive on their investment in our products and services. Our ability to compete effectively for advertisers also depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to offer attractive advertising products with unique targeting capabilities and the size of our active user base. We have seen escalating competition for digital ad spending and expect this trend to continue. In addition, many advertisers, particularly branded advertisers use marketing mix analyses to determine how to allocate their advertising budgets on an annual or bi-annual basis. As a result, we need to demonstrate to those advertisers during the appropriate time period that we provide a better return on investment than our competitors do in order to secure, increase or sustain our share of the advertising budget allocated for a significant portion of the year until the next budget cycle. We intend to continue to invest in research and development to improve our products and services for users and advertisers and to grow our active user base in order to address the competitive challenges in our industry. As part of our strategy to improve our products and services, we may acquire other companies to add engineering talent or complementary products and technologies.\nInvestment in Infrastructure. We strive to optimize the capacity and enhance the capability and reliability of our infrastructure. Our infrastructure is critical to providing users, platform partners, advertisers and data partners access to our platform, particularly during major planned and unplanned events, such as elections, sporting events or natural disasters, when activity on our platform increases dramatically. As our user base and the activity on our platform grow, we expect that investments and expenses associated with our infrastructure will continue to grow. These investments and expenses include the expansion and improvement of our data center operations and related operating costs, additional servers and networking equipment to increase the capacity of our infrastructure and increased bandwidth costs.\nProducts and Services Innovation. Our ability to increase the size and engagement of our user base, attract advertisers and increase our revenue will depend, in part, on our ability to improve existing products and services and to successfully develop or acquire new products and services. We plan to continue to make significant investments in research and development and, from time to time, we may acquire companies to enhance our products, services and technical capabilities.\nInvestment in Talent. We intend to invest in hiring key roles and retaining talented employees to grow our business. We have seen high levels of attrition, and as a result, need to focus on hiring and employee retention to be successful. We have also made, and intend to continue to make, acquisitions that add engineers, designers, product managers and other personnel with specific technology expertise. In addition, we must retain our high-performing personnel in order to continue to develop, sell and market our products and services and manage our business.\nSeasonality. Advertising spending is traditionally strongest in the fourth quarter of each year. Historically, this seasonality in advertising spending has affected our quarterly results, with higher sequential advertising revenue growth from the third quarter to the fourth quarter compared to sequential advertising revenue growth from the fourth quarter to the subsequent first quarter. For example, our advertising revenue increased 25%, 17% and 28% between the third and fourth quarters of 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively, while advertising revenue for the first quarter of 2016 and 2017 decreased 17% and 26% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense. We have historically utilized, and intend to continue to utilize, various forms of stock-based awards in order to hire and retain talented employees. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recognized $433.8 million and $615.2 million of expense related to stock-based compensation, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of approximately $598.7 million related to outstanding equity awards, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of approximately two years. The stock-based compensation expenses related to our outstanding equity awards have a significant impact on the amount of net income we generate on a GAAP basis. We continued to make progress in reducing our annual stock-based compensation expense on both an absolute basis and as a percentage of revenue. We remain committed to reducing stock-based compensation to high single digits to low teens as a percentage of revenue over time, bringing us more in line with our peers.\nResults of Operations\nThe

December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015\nRevenue\nWe generate the substantial majority of our revenue from the sale of advertising services. We also generate revenue by licensing our data to third parties and providing mobile advertising exchange services.\nAdvertising Services\nWe generate most of our advertising revenue by selling our Promoted Products. Currently, our Promoted Products consist of the following:\nTable 193: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Promoted Tweets. Promoted Tweets, which are labeled as promoted,\u201d appear within a user's timeline, search results or profile pages just like an ordinary Tweet regardless of device, whether it be desktop or mobile. Using our proprietary algorithms and understanding of the interests of each user, we can deliver Promoted Tweets that are intended to be relevant to a particular user. We enable our advertisers to target an audience based on our users' Interest Graphs. Our Promoted Tweets are pay-for-performance or pay-for-impression delivered advertising that are priced through an auction. Our Promoted Tweets include objective-based features that allow advertisers to pay only for the types of engagement selected by the advertisers, such as Tweet engagements (e.g., Retweets, replies and likes), website clicks or conversions, mobile application installs or engagements, obtaining new followers, or video views.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Promoted Accounts. Promoted Accounts, which are labeled as promoted,\u201d provide a way for our advertisers to grow a community of users who are interested in their business, products or services.

Promoted Trends, which are labeled as promoted,\u201d appear at the top of the list of trending topics or timeline for an entire day in a particular country or on a global basis. We sell our Promoted Trends on a fixed-fee-per-day basis.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhile the majority of the Promoted Products we sell to our advertisers are placed on Twitter, we also generate advertising revenue by placing advertising products that we sell to advertisers on third-party publishers' websites, applications or other offerings.\nData Licensing and Other\nWe generate data licensing and other revenue by (i) offering data products and data licenses that allow our data partners to access, search and analyze historical and real-time data on our platform, which data consists of public Tweets and their content, and (ii) providing mobile advertising exchange services through our MoPub exchange. Our data partners generally purchase licenses to access all or a portion of our data for a fixed period. We recognize data licensing revenue as the licensed data is made available to our data partners. In addition, we operate a mobile ad exchange and receive service fees from transactions completed on the exchange. Our mobile ad exchange enables buyers and sellers to purchase and sell advertising inventory and matches buyers and sellers. We have determined we are not the principal in the purchase and sale of advertising inventory in transactions between third-party buyers and sellers on the exchange. Therefore we report revenue related to our ad exchange services on a net basis.\nTable 196: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2016 to 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015 to 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Advertising services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,109,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,248,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,994,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Data licensing and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 333,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 281,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 223,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,443,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,529,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,218,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 Compared to 2016. Revenue in 2017 decreased by $86.3 million compared to 2016.\nIn 2017, advertising revenue decreased by 6% compared to 2016. The substantial majority of our advertising revenue was generated from our owned and operated platform. Advertising revenue generated from the sale of our advertising products on our owned and operated platform in 2017 was $1.90 billion as compared to $1.99 billion in 2016. Advertising revenue generated from the sale of our advertising products placed on third-party publishers' websites, applications and other offerings in 2017 was $211.2 million as compared to $260.2 million in 2016. The decrease in advertising revenue from the sale of our advertising products placed on third-party publishers' websites, applications and other offerings in 2017 was driven by significantly lower contribution from TellApart (which was deprecated in 2017), which was offset by strong performance from Twitter Audience Platform. TellApart revenue was $44.6 million in 2017, mainly in the first half of 2017, compared to $126.4 million in 2016.\nThe overall decrease in advertising revenue was primarily attributable to a 52% decrease in average cost per ad engagement offset by a 96% increase in the number of ad engagements in 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease in average cost per ad engagement reflects a higher mix of video ad engagements (which have overall lower cost per ad engagement compared to other ad formats) and lower cost per ad engagement across the majority of ad formats compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in ad engagements was driven by a continuing mix shift toward video ad impressions as well as higher click-through rates.\nAdvertising revenue continued to be driven by strong growth in our video ad formats offset by declines in traditional Promoted Tweet and direct response ad formats. As our user base and the level of engagement of our users grow, we believe the potential to increase our revenue grows.\nIn 2017, data licensing and other revenue increased by 18% compared to 2016. A majority of the increase was attributable to growth in data licensing fees from the offering of data products. We expect to continue to grow our data revenue with a new product and channel segmented go-to-market approach.\n2016 Compared to 2015. Revenue in 2016 increased by $311.6 million compared to 2015.\nIn 2016, advertising revenue increased by 13% compared to 2015. Foreign exchange effect did not have a material impact on advertising revenue in 2016. The substantial majority of our advertising revenue was generated from our owned and operated platform. Advertising revenue generated from the sale of our advertising products on our owned and operated platform in 2016 was $1.99 billion as compared to $1.80 billion in 2015. Advertising revenue generated from the sale of our advertising products placed on third-party publishers' websites, applications and other offerings in 2016 was $260.2 million as compared to $194.2 million in 2015, which increase was driven, in part, by the acquisition of TellApart in May 2015 and from the growth of sales in our organically-built advertising network, Twitter Audience Platform. The overall increase in advertising revenue was primarily attributable to a 152% increase in the number of ad engagements offset by a 55% decrease in average cost per ad engagement in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in ad engagements was driven by continued adoption of auto-play video and an increase in ad load. The decrease in average cost per ad engagement was due primarily to the shift to auto-play video, which delivers more engagement at a much lower average cost per engagement than click-to-play video ads and decreases in same-format prices for most of our other advertising products. Advertising revenue continued to be driven by growth in demand for our advertising products, particularly video as well as growth in our advertising base. Strength from our video ad format, however, was offset by year-over-year declines in revenue generated from our traditional Promoted Tweet ad format.\nIn 2016, data licensing and other revenue increased by 26% compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in mobile advertising exchange services and to a lesser extent an increase in data licensing fees from the offering of data products.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue includes infrastructure costs, other direct costs including content costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets and amortization of capitalized labor costs for internally developed software, allocated facilities costs, as well as traffic acquisition costs, or TAC. Infrastructure costs consist primarily of data center costs related to our co-located facilities, which include lease and hosting costs, related support and maintenance costs and energy and bandwidth costs; as well as depreciation of servers and networking equipment; and personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, for our operations teams. TAC consists of costs we incur with third parties in connection with the sale to advertisers of our advertising products that we place on third-party publishers' websites, applications or other offerings collectively resulting from acquisitions, and from our organically-built advertising network, Twitter Audience Platform. Many of the elements of our cost of revenue are fixed, and cannot be reduced in the near term.\nTable 197: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2016 to 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015 to 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 861,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 932,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 729,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 Compared to 2016. In 2017, cost of revenue decreased by $71.0 million compared to 2016. The decrease was attributable to a $48.6 million decrease in restructuring expenses, a $45.3 million decrease in infrastructure costs, a $42.7 million decrease in TAC substantially due to the decrease in advertising revenue generated from TellApart (which we deprecated in 2017), and a $3.5 million decrease in personnel-related costs. These decreases were offset by a $55.5 million increase in other direct costs that is primarily driven by an increase in content costs, and a $13.6 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily related to additional internally developed software, server and networking equipment.\n2016 Compared to 2015. In 2016, cost of revenue, which included TAC of $141.6 million, increased by $203.0 million compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to a $63.4 million increase in networking, hosting and data center costs related to our co-located facilities, a $54.6 million increase in depreciation expense related to additional server and networking equipment and amortization of acquired intangible assets, a $47.9 million increase in restructuring expenses as a result of lease write-offs, a $40.0 million increase in other direct costs, and a $19.7 million increase in TAC. The increases were offset by a $22.6 million decrease in personnel-related costs, mainly driven by a decrease in average employee headcount and compensation expense.\nWe plan to continue to scale the capacity and enhance the capability and reliability of our infrastructure to support user growth and increased activity on our platform. We also expect that the amount of revenue generated from the sale of our advertising services on third-party publishers' websites, applications and other offerings will vary. As a result, we expect that cost of revenue will vary in absolute dollar amounts for the foreseeable future and vary in the near term from period to period as a percentage of revenue.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, for our engineers and other employees engaged in the research and development of our products and services. In addition, research and development expenses include amortization of acquired intangible assets, allocated facilities and other supporting overhead costs.\nTable 198: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2016 to 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015 to 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 542,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 713,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 806,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 Compared to 2016. In 2017, research and development expenses decreased by $171.5 million compared to 2016. The decrease was attributable to a $141.6 million decrease in personnel-related costs, mainly driven by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense, a $25.9 million decrease in restructuring charges net of a one-time nonrecurring gain on sale of assets in 2017, a $23.7 million decrease in allocated facilities and other supporting overhead expenses due to a decrease in overall total expenses, a $2.6 million decrease in other expenses, and a $2.5 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense, offset by a $24.8 million decrease in the capitalization of costs associated with developing software for internal use.\n2016 Compared to 2015. In 2016, research and development expenses decreased by $93.2 million compared to 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $69.1 million decrease in personnel-related costs, mainly driven by a decrease in compensation expense from a decrease in average employee headcount, a $42.7 million increase in the capitalization of costs associated with developing software for internal use due primarily to an increase in the number of projects as we refine our core services, and a $2.5 million decrease in other expenses. The decreases were offset by a $9.1 million increase in allocated facilities and other supporting overhead expenses, a $7.2 million increase in restructuring expenses and a $4.8 million increase in depreciation expense.\nWe plan to continue to invest in key areas of our business to ensure that we have the right level of engineering, product management and design teams to support our research and development efforts. We expect that both research and development headcount and costs in absolute dollars will increase in the near term but will vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, commissions, benefits and stock-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, business development and media, marketing, corporate communications and customer service functions. In addition, marketing and sales-related expenses also include advertising costs, market research, tradeshows, branding, marketing, public relations costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, as well as allocated facilities and other supporting overhead costs.\nTable 199: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2016 to 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015 to 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 717,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 957,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 871,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (25\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 Compared to 2016. In 2017, sales and marketing expenses decreased by $240.4 million compared to 2016. The decrease was attributable to a $116.0 million decrease in personnel-related costs, driven by a decrease in average employee headcount mainly as a result of our 2016 restructuring plan, a $54.0 million decrease in marketing and sales-related expenses, a $28.0 million decrease in allocated facilities and other supporting overhead expenses due to a decrease in overall total expenses, a $27.4 million decrease in restructuring expenses, and a $15.0 million decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets.\n2016 Compared to 2015. In 2016, sales and marketing expenses increased by $86.3 million compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to a $31.9 million increase in allocated facilities and other supporting overhead expenses due to the increase in support functions, a $27.6 million increase in restructuring expenses mainly driven by a reduction in workforce at the end of 2016, a $21.8 million increase in personnel-related costs, mainly driven by an increase in compensation expense, and a $16.5 million increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets, offset by an $11.5 million decrease in marketing and sales-related expenses.\nWe continue to evaluate key areas in our business to ensure we have the right level of sales and marketing to execute on our key priorities and objectives. We expect that both sales and marketing headcount and costs in absolute dollars will increase in the near term but will vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, for our executive, finance, legal, information technology, human resources and other administrative employees. In addition, general and administrative expenses include fees and costs for professional services, including consulting, third-party legal and accounting services and facilities and other supporting overhead costs that are not allocated to other departments.\nTable 200: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2016 to 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015 to 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 283,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 293,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 260,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 Compared to 2016. In 2017, general and administrative expense decreased by $9.4 million compared to 2016. The decrease was attributable to a $9.2 million decrease in personnel-related costs, mainly driven by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense, a $4.9 million decrease in facilities and supporting costs, and a $4.8 million decrease in restructuring charges. The decreases were offset by a $9.0 million increase in fees and costs for professional services, and a $0.5 million increase in other expenses.\n2016 Compared to 2015. In 2016, general and administrative expense increased by $32.6 million compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to a $17.1 million increase in personnel-related costs, driven by an increase in compensation expense from an increase in average employee headcount, a $6.8 million increase in facilities and supporting costs not allocated to other functions, a $6.5 million increase in fees and costs for professional services, and a $5.6 million increase in restructuring expenses. The increases were offset by a $3.4 million increase in the capitalization of costs associated with developing software for internal use.\nWe plan to continue to invest in key areas of our business and ensure that we have the right level of general and administrative support on our key priorities and objectives. We expect that general and administrative expenses will vary in the near term from period to period as a percentage of revenue.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest expense incurred in connection with the $935.0 million principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes due 2019, or the 2019 Notes, and $954.0 million principal amount of 1.00% convertible senior notes due 2021, or the 2021 Notes and together with the 2019 Notes, the Notes, and interest expense related to capital leases and other financing facilities.\nTable 201: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 105,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 99,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 98,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 Compared to 2016. In 2017, interest expense increased by $5.3 million compared to 2016. Interest expense in 2017 was comprised of $99.6 million of total interest expense related to the Notes as well as our credit facility (described below) and $5.6 million related to capital leases of equipment.\n2016 Compared to 2015. In 2016, interest expense increased by $1.8 million compared to 2015. Interest expense in 2016 was comprised of $94.5 million of total interest expense related to the Notes as well as our credit facility and $5.5 million related to capital leases of equipment.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net, consists primarily of interest income resulting from our short-term investments net of the related amortization of premium paid on such investments, and unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses due to re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies as well as realized foreign exchange gains and losses on foreign exchange transactions. We expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates.\nTable 202: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (28,921\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 26,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 Compared to 2016. In 2017, other expense, net, was $28.9 million compared to other income, net, of $26.3 million in 2016. The change was primarily attributable to the recording of an other-than-temporary impairment on a cost-method investment of $62.4 million in 2017 and less favorable foreign currency exchange impacts from foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities as well as derivative financial instruments, offset by an increase in interest income on our short term investments.\nOther expense, net, in 2017 was comprised of $62.4 million of other-than-temporary impairment on a cost-method investment, $8.8 million of foreign currency exchange net loss, and $1.0 million of other expense, offset by $43.3 million of interest and other income.\n2016 Compared to 2015. In 2016, other income, net, increased by $11.4 million compared to 2015. The increase was attributable to an increase in interest income on our short term investments and favorable foreign currency exchange impacts from foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities as well as derivative financial instruments, offset by an increase in other expenses.\nOther income, net, in 2016 was comprised of $25.3 million of interest and other income and $5.8 million of foreign currency exchange gain, offset by $4.8 million of other expenses.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes consists of federal and state income taxes in the United States and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions which are expected to fluctuate based on the pre-tax results within and outside of the United States and will also be impacted by our allocation of centrally incurred costs to foreign jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rate will also be affected by the changes in tax rates and tax regulations, the impact of tax examinations, the impact of business combinations, and changes in valuation allowance. In addition, the provision is impacted by deferred income taxes and changes in the related valuation allowance reflecting the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.\nIn December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d), was signed into law. Among other provisions, the Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result, we were required to re-measure our net deferred tax assets, which resulted in a reduction of our deferred tax assets by $352.9 million, with a corresponding decrease to the valuation allowance of the same amount. We are in the process of assessing the impact of the international tax provisions provided for in the Tax Act that would apply for calendar years 2018 onwards. We are not, however, subject to the one-time mandatory transition tax.\nTable 203: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision (benefit) for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (12,274\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 Compared to 2016. Our provision for income taxes in 2017 decreased by $3.4 million compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in the income tax benefit arising from intraperiod allocation and partial release of valuation allowance attributable to the Tax Act related to AMT tax credits.\n2016 Compared to 2015. Our provision for income taxes in 2016 changed by $28.3 million compared to a benefit of $12.3 million in 2015. The increase was primarily due to a decrease in the income tax benefit arising from acquisitions of $24.2 million, and by an increase in income tax expense in foreign jurisdictions of $4.1 million. The $24.2 million decrease in income tax benefit is related to the release of deferred tax valuation allowance resulting from acquisitions completed within the prior year. The deferred tax liabilities recorded in the prior year, as part of purchase accounting, provided an additional source of taxable income to support the realizability of pre-existing deferred tax assets. In the year ended December 31, 2016, the acquisitions we completed did not result in a release of deferred tax valuation allowance due to acquisitions either in a foreign jurisdiction with no valuation allowance or offsetting acquired deferred tax assets.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $3.43 billion of federal and $1.47 billion of state net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income. These net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire for federal income tax purposes and state income tax purposes in 2027 and 2018, respectively. We also have research credit carryforwards of $259.6 million and $208.6 million for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. The federal research credit carryforward will begin to expire in 2027. The state research credit carryforward has no expiration date. Additionally, we have California Enterprise Zone credit carryforwards of $19.1 million which will begin to expire in 2023. Utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards and research credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state provisions. Any annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and research credits before utilization.\nUpon adoption of the stock-based compensation expense simplification rule including the income tax consequences; and the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets resulting from the enactment of the Tax Act, as of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $782.3 million of federal and $222.8 million of state net deferred tax assets. Concurrently, we set up a valuation allowance against all but $2.0 million of these deferred tax assets. As of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 we completed our reassessment of the realizability of these assets and have concluded that a valuation allowance is still required.\nEvaluating the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets often requires significant judgment and extensive analysis of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not (a probability level of more than 50%) that these assets will be realized. In completing this assessment management must consider both objective and subjective factors in its assessment. These factors include, but are not limited to:\nTable 204: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Future reversal of existing temporary differences\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 205: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Tax-planning strategies\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 206: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and loss carryforwards\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs we continue to make significant strides in optimizing operations resulting in improved financial results, our future reassessment is likely to result in the determination that a valuation allowance is no longer required. This would result in such future financial reporting period in a significant reversal of the valuation allowance and a corresponding material non-cash income tax benefit and the recording of additional deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. Based on recent earnings in certain jurisdictions, sufficient positive evidence may exist within the 2018 calendar year such that we may release a significant portion of our valuation allowance.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our unaudited consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2017.

2013, we entered into a revolving credit agreement with certain lenders which provides for a $1.0 billion revolving unsecured credit facility maturing on October 22, 2018. Loans under the credit facility bear interest, at our option, at (i) a base rate based on the highest of the prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and an adjusted LIBOR rate for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%, in each case plus a margin ranging from 0.00% to 0.75% or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from 1.00% to 1.75%. This margin is determined based on our total leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period. We are also obligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type, including an upfront fee and an unused commitment fee. Our obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. In addition, the credit facility contains restrictions on payments including cash payment of dividends.\nThe revolving credit agreement was amended in September 2014 to increase the amount of indebtedness that we may incur and increase the amount of restricted payments that we may make. This amendment to the revolving credit agreement also provides that if our total leverage ratio exceeds 2.5:1.0 and if the amount outstanding under the credit facility exceeds $500.0 million, or 50% of the amount that may be borrowed under the credit facility, the credit facility will become secured by substantially all of our and certain of our subsidiaries' assets, subject to limited exceptions. As of December 31, 2017, no amounts were drawn under the credit facility.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nTable 215: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (108,063\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (456,873\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (521,031\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 831,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 763,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 383,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (112,932\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (598,008\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (902,421\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (78,373\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (83,975\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (62,998\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments in marketable securities. Our cash equivalents and marketable securities are invested primarily in short-term fixed income securities, including government and investment-grade debt securities and money market funds. In 2014, we also received net proceeds of approximately $1.86 billion from the issuance of the Notes, after deducting the initial purchasers' discount and debt issuance costs. Concurrently with the sales of the Notes, we entered into privately-negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with respect to our common stock for which we paid approximately $407.2 million and sold warrants for which we received approximately $289.3 million. We expect that we will continue to incur cash interest expense for the term of the Notes. In addition, we have access to funds under our credit facility and have, in the past, accessed the capital markets.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $4.40 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in marketable securities, of which $239.9 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Under the current tax laws, if these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate certain of these funds. However, our intent is to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations. In addition, we have a revolving unsecured credit facility available to borrow up to $1.0 billion. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balance, and our credit facility, together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. The Tax Act is not expected to have a material impact on our liquidity and capital resources going forward.\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities consists of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items including depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, amortization of discount on our Notes, deferred income taxes, impairment of investments in privately-held companies, non-cash restructuring charges, as well as the effect of changes in working capital and other activities.\nCash provided by operating activities in 2017 was $831.2 million, an increase in cash inflow of $68.2 million compared to 2016. Cash provided by operating activities was driven by a net loss of $108.1 million, as adjusted for the exclusion of non-cash expenses and other adjustments totaling $971.5 million, of which $433.8 million was related to stock-based compensation expense, $395.9 million was related to depreciation and amortization expense and $62.4 million was related to other-than-temporary impairment on a cost-method investment, and the effect of changes in working capital and other carrying balances that resulted in cash outflows of $32.2 million.\nCash provided by operating activities in 2016 was $763.1 million, an increase in cash inflow of $380.0 million compared to 2015. Cash provided by operating activities was driven by a net loss of $456.9 million, as adjusted for the exclusion of non-cash expenses and other adjustments totaling $1.14 billion, of which $615.2 million was related to stock-based compensation expense, and the effect of changes in working capital and other carrying balances that resulted in cash outflow of $82.6 million.\nCash provided by operating activities in 2015 was $383.1 million, an increase in cash inflow of $301.3 million compared to 2014. Cash provided by operating activities was driven by a net loss of $521.0 million, as adjusted for the exclusion of non-cash expenses and other adjustments totaling $1.04 billion, of which $678.9 million was related to stock-based compensation expense, and the effect of changes in working capital and other carrying balances that resulted in cash outflow of $135.9 million.\nInvesting Activities\nOur primary investing activities consist of purchases of property and equipment, particularly purchases of servers and networking equipment, leasehold improvements for our facilities, purchases and disposal of marketable securities, strategic investments in privately-held companies, acquisitions of businesses and other activities.\nCash used in investing activities in 2017 was $112.9 million, a decrease in cash outflow of $485.1 million compared to 2016. The change was primarily due to a $221.4 million decrease in the purchases of marketable securities, a $80.7 million decrease in purchases of investments in privately-held companies, a net $85.1 million decrease in cash used in business combinations, a $57.9 million decrease in purchases of property and equipment, a $35.0 million increase in proceeds from sale of long-lived assets, a $2.8 million increase in proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities, and a $2.8 million increase in proceeds from sales of property and equipment, offset by a $0.6 million increase in expenditures on other investing activities.\nCash used in investing activities in 2016 was $598.0 million, a decrease in cash outflow of $304.4 million compared to 2015. The decrease in cash outflow was due to decreased purchases of marketable securities of $774.9 million, property and equipment of $128.6 million and other investments of $8.7 million, offset by a decrease in sales and maturities of marketable securities of $503.4 million, an increase in purchase of investments in privately-held companies of $71.0 million, and an increase in use of cash as acquisition consideration of $33.4 million.\nCash used in investing activities in 2015 was $902.4 million, a decrease in cash outflow of $194.9 million compared to 2014. The decrease in cash outflow was due to the increase in sales and maturities of marketable securities of $987.6 million and a reduction in use of cash as acquisition consideration of $111.8 million. Such increases in cash inflow were partially offset by increased purchases of marketable securities of $746.4 million, property and equipment of $145.7 million and other investments of $12.4 million.\nWe anticipate making capital expenditures in 2018 of approximately $375 million to $450 million, a portion of which we may finance through capital leases, as we continue to expand our co-located data centers.\nFinancing Activities\nOur primary financing activities consist of issuances of securities, including common stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan, capital lease financing and stock option exercises by employees and other service providers.\nCash used in financing activities in 2017 was $78.4 million, a decrease in cash outflow of $5.6 million compared to 2016. The decrease in cash outflow was due to a $6.4 million decrease in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards and other activities and a $1.9 million increase in proceeds from option exercises. These decreases were offset by a $2.2 million increase in payments of capital lease obligations and a $0.5 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of shares of stock from ESPP.\nCash used in financing activities in 2016 was $84.0 million, an increase in cash outflow of $21.0 million compared to 2015. The increase in cash outflow was due to a $14.9 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of shares of stock from ESPP, a net $13.3 million increase in tax payments related to net share settlements of equity awards and other activities, and a net $9.8 million decrease in proceeds from option exercises, offset by a reduction in repayments of capital lease obligations of $17.0 million.\nCash used in financing activities in 2015 was $63.0 million compared to $1.69 billion cash provided by financing activities in 2014. The decrease in cash inflow was due to the absence of any financing transactions in 2015 similar to the issuance of the Notes in 2014.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements and did not have any such arrangements in 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nContractual Obligations\nOur principal commitments consist of obligations under the Notes (including principal and coupon interest), capital and operating leases for equipment, office space and co-located data center facilities, as well as non-cancellable contractual commitments. The following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of December 31, 2017.\nTable 216: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2019 Notes\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 939,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 937,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2021 Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 992,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 963,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 590,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 149,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 213,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 108,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 119,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 172,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 90,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 82,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other contractual commitments (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 109,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 95,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,804,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 347,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,265,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,071,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 119,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 217: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> During the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we entered into several sublease agreements for office space that we are not fully utilizing.

Due to uncertainties in the timing of potential tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months. As a result, this amount is not included in the above table.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or operating results would be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss further below.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate the substantial majority of our revenue from the sale of advertising services with the balance coming from data licensing and other arrangements. We generate our advertising revenue primarily from the sale of our three Promoted Products: (i) Promoted Tweets, (ii) Promoted Accounts and (iii) Promoted Trends. Promoted Tweets and Promoted Accounts are pay-for-performance advertising products or pay on impressions delivered priced through an auction. Promoted Trends are featured by geography and offered on a fixed-fee-per-day basis. Advertisers are obligated to pay when a user engages with a Promoted Tweet or follows a Promoted Account or when an impression is delivered or when a Promoted Trend is displayed. These products may be sold in combination as a multiple element arrangement or separately on a stand-alone basis.\nWe also generate advertising revenue by selling to advertisers advertising products which we place on third-party publishers' websites, applications or other offerings. To fulfill these transactions, we purchase advertising inventory from third-party publishers' websites and applications where we have identified the advertisers' targeted audience and therefore incur traffic acquisition costs. In such transactions, we remain the primary obligor to our advertisers for the advertising services and products delivered, have pricing latitude, have discretion in the selection of third-party publishers and bear credit risk. We might not generate advertising revenue in excess of traffic acquisition costs incurred. Therefore, we report advertising revenue generated from these transactions on a gross basis.\nFees for these advertising services are recognized in the period when advertising is delivered as evidenced by a user engaging with a Promoted Tweet in a manner satisfying the types of engagement selected by the advertisers, such as Tweet engagements (e.g., retweets, replies and likes), website clicks or conversions, mobile application installs or engagements, obtaining new followers, or video views, following a Promoted Account, delivery of impressions, through the display of a Promoted Trend on our platform, or completion of a transaction on an external website.\nData licensing revenue is generated based on monthly service fees charged to the data partners over the period in which Twitter data and data products are made available to them. Other revenue is primarily generated from service fees from transactions completed on our mobile ad exchange. Our mobile ad exchange enables buyers and sellers to purchase and sell advertising inventory and matches buyers and sellers. We have determined we are not the principal in the purchase and sale of advertising inventory in transactions between third-party buyers and sellers on the exchange. Therefore, we report revenue related to our ad exchange services on a net basis.\nRevenue is recognized only when (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) the price is fixed or determinable; (3) the service is performed; and (4) collectability of the related fee is reasonably assured. While the majority of our revenue transactions are based on standard business terms and conditions, we also enter into sales agreements with advertisers and data partners that sometimes involve multiple elements.\nFor arrangements involving multiple deliverables, judgment is required to determine the appropriate accounting, including developing an estimate of the stand-alone selling price of each deliverable. When neither vendor-specific objective evidence nor third-party evidence of selling price exists, we use our best estimate of selling price (BESP) to allocate the arrangement consideration on a relative selling price basis to each deliverable. The objective of BESP is to determine the selling price of each deliverable when it is sold to advertisers on a stand-alone basis. In determining BESPs, we take into consideration various factors, including, but not limited to, prices we charge for similar offerings, sales volume, geographies, pricing strategies and market conditions. Multiple deliverable arrangements primarily consist of combinations of our pay-for-performance products, Promoted Tweets and Promoted Accounts, which are priced through an auction, and Promoted Trends, which are priced on a fixed-fee-per day per geography basis. For arrangements that include a combination of these products, we develop an estimate of the selling price for these products in order to allocate any potential discount to all advertising products in the arrangement. The estimate of selling price for pay-for-performance products is determined based on the winning bid price; the estimate of selling price for Promoted Trends is based on Promoted Trends sold on a stand-alone basis and/or separately priced in a bundled arrangement by reference to a list price by geography which is approved periodically. We believe the use of BESP results in revenue recognition in a manner consistent with the underlying economics of the transaction and allocates the arrangement consideration on a relative selling price basis to each deliverable.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and several foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.\nAlthough we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as any related interest or penalties.\nOur effective tax rates have differed from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of foreign operations, state taxes, certain benefits realized in recording the tax effects of business combinations, and the recording of U.S. valuation allowance. Our future provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations or accounting principles. In addition, we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by tax authorities in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.\nThe recently-enacted Tax Act contains several key tax provisions that affected us, including a reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018, among others. We are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, such as re-measuring our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as our valuation allowance against our net U.S. deferred tax assets. In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB 118), which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Since the Tax Act was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017, and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretation are expected over the next 12 months, we consider the accounting of the deferred tax re-measurements, and other items to be incomplete due to the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis of final year-end data and tax positions. We expect to complete our analysis within the measurement period in accordance with SAB 118.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation expense under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions in accordance with the applicable accounting standards which require all stock-based awards granted to employees to be measured based on the grant-date fair value.\nThe fair value of stock options granted and stock purchase rights provided under the employee stock purchase plan is estimated based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model which requires inputs of judgmental assumptions including the expected term of the award and stock price volatility. If any of the assumptions used in the fair value determination change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially. The fair value of performance-based restricted stock awards with market conditions is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the grant date fair value.\nFor service-based restricted stock awards and performance-based restricted stock awards without market conditions, we recognize the compensation expense only for those awards expected to meet the performance and service vesting condition on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period which is generally one year for performance vesting condition awards and four years for service vesting condition awards. For performance-based restricted stock awards with market conditions, we recognize the compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied, provided that the requisite service has been provided.\nUpon adoption of the stock-based compensation expense simplification rule as of January 1, 2017, we no longer apply a forfeiture rate to determine the stock-based compensation expense; instead, we account for forfeitures as they occur.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount or range can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. We review these provisions on a quarterly basis and adjust these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.\nWe believe that the amount or estimable range of reasonably possible loss, will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies as of December 31, 2017. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period, could be materially adversely affected.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for acquisitions of entities that include inputs and processes and have the ability to create outputs as business combinations. The purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of operations.\nAccounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions at the acquisition date, including estimated fair value of acquired intangible assets, estimated fair value of stock awards assumed from the acquirees that are included in the purchase price, estimated income tax assets and liabilities assumed from the acquirees, and determination of the fair value of contractual obligations, where applicable. The estimates of fair value require management to also make estimates of, among other things, future expected cash flows, discount rates or expected costs to reproduce an asset. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.\nImpact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards\nThe impact of recently issued accounting standards is set forth in Note 2, Summary

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplemental Data\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFY 2017 Overview and Highlights\nTotal revenue was $2.44 billion, a decrease of 3% compared to 2016.\n \u2022 Advertising revenue totaled $2.11 billion, a decrease of 6% compared to 2016. \n \u2022 Data licensing and other revenue totaled $333.3 million, an increase of 18% compared to 2016. \n \u2022 U.S. revenue totaled $1.41 billion, a decrease of 10% compared to 2016. \n \u2022 International revenue totaled $1.03 billion, an increase of 7% compared to 2016. \n \u2022 Total ad engagements increased 96% year-over-year. \n \u2022 Cost per engagement decreased 52% year-over-year. \nNet loss was $108.1 million, a decrease of 76% compared to 2016.\nNon-GAAP net income was $328.9 million, an increase of 24% compared to 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $863.0 million, an increase of 15% compared to 2016.\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in marketable securities totaled $4.40 billion as of December 31, 2017.\nAverage monthly active users were 330 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 4% compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nAverage daily active usage for the three months ended December 31, 2017 grew 12% year-over-year.\nKey Metrics\nWe review a number of metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions.\nMonthly Active Users (MAUs). We define MAUs as Twitter users who logged in or were otherwise authenticated and accessed Twitter through our website, mobile website, desktop or mobile applications, SMS or registered third-party applications or websites in the 30-day period ending on the date of measurement. Average MAUs for a period represent the average of the MAUs at the end of each month during the period. MAUs are a measure of the size of our logged in or otherwise authenticated active user base. In the three months ended December 31, 2017, we had 330 million average MAUs, which represents an increase of 4% from the three months ended December 31, 2016(1). The growth in average MAUs was driven by a combination of organic growth, marketing, and product improvements, including the ongoing benefits of improved relevance in email, push notifications and the timeline. In the three months ended December 31, 2017, we had 68 million average MAUs in the United States and 262 million average MAUs in the rest of the world, which represent increases of 2% and 4%, respectively, from the three months ended December 31, 2016. For additional information on how we calculate MAUs and factors that can affect this metric, see the section titled Note Regarding Key Metrics.\u201d\nMAU growth is historically seasonally weak in the fourth quarter. In addition, a recent change was made to Safari's integration with third-party applications including Twitter that resulted in a decrease of approximately 2 million MAUs that accessed Twitter by using registered third-party applications when those applications automatically contact our servers for regular updates without discernible user-initiated action, which we refer to as third-party auto-polling MAU. However, we do not serve ads to this subset of MAUs and as a result, no revenue is generated from such MAUs. MAU in the fourth quarter was also impacted by increased information quality efforts, which are our overall efforts to reduce malicious activity on the service, inclusive of spam, malicious automation, and fake accounts.\n \n(1) Reported average Monthly Active Users reflects adjustments for approximately 1-2 million users per quarter of certain third-party applications that were included as Twitter MAUs that should not have been considered MAUs in certain prior periods. Daily Active Usage was not affected. Further details regarding the adjustment can be found in the section titled \"Note About Our MAU Adjustment.\"\nNote About Our MAU Adjustment\nIn the third quarter of 2017, we discovered that since the fourth quarter of 2014 we had included users of certain third-party applications as Twitter MAUs that should not have been considered MAUs. These third-party applications used Digits, a software development kit of our now-divested Fabric platform, that allowed third-party applications to send authentication messages via SMS through our systems, which did not relate to activity on the Twitter platform. The table below presents the impact for the periods beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016. Due to our data retention policies, we do not have data to reconcile periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2016, but our estimates suggest the prior period adjustments are smaller than those in the fourth quarter of 2016.\n\nChanges in Daily Active Users/Daily Active Usage (DAU). We define daily active users or daily active usage as Twitter users who logged in or were otherwise authenticated and accessed Twitter through our website, mobile website or mobile applications on any given day. Average DAU for a period represents the number of DAUs on each day of such period divided by the number of days for such period. Changes in DAU are a measure of changes in the size of our daily logged in or otherwise authenticated active user base. To calculate the year-over-year change in DAUs, we subtract the average DAU for the three months ended in the previous year from the average DAU for the same three months ended in the current year and divide the result by the average DAU for the three months ended in the previous year. Prior to reporting results for the third quarter of 2016, we had discussed DAUs and the ratio of MAUs to DAUs. In those instances, for comparability and consistency with MAUs, DAUs also included users who accessed Twitter through our desktop applications and third-party properties. For additional information on how we calculate changes in DAUs and factors that can affect this metric, see the section titled Note Regarding Key Metrics.\u201d Reported DAU metrics were not impacted by the MAU adjustment discussed above as DAU do not include users from third-party applications.\nDAU grew faster than MAU in the fourth quarter of 2017 as we continued to benefit from organic growth, product and marketing investments made in this quarter and in prior periods.\nChanges in Ad Engagements and Cost per Ad Engagement. We define an ad engagement as a user interaction with one of our pay-for-performance advertising products. Ad engagements with our advertising products are based on a user completing an objective set out by an advertiser such as expanding, Retweeting, liking or replying to a Promoted Tweet, viewing an embedded video, downloading or engaging with a promoted mobile application, clicking on a website link, signing up for marketing emails from advertisers, following the account that tweets a Promoted Tweet, or completing a transaction on an external website. We believe changes in ad engagements is one way to measure user engagement with our advertising products. We believe changes in cost per ad engagement is one way to measure demand.\nIn the three months ended December 31, 2017, ad engagements increased 75% from the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase was driven by a continuing mix shift toward video ad impressions as well as higher click-through rates. In the three months ended December 31, 2017, average cost per ad engagement decreased 42% from the three months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in cost per ad engagement reflects a higher mix of video ad engagements (which have overall lower cost per ad engagement compared to other ad formats) and lower cost per ad engagement across the majority of ad formats compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFactors Affecting Our Future Performance\nUser Growth and Monetization. User growth trends reflected in the number of MAUs, changes in DAUs and monetization trends reflected in advertising engagements are key factors that affect our revenue. As our user base and the level of engagement of our users grow, we believe the potential to increase our revenue grows.\nUser Growth. We have generally experienced growth in our number of users over the last several years. In general, a higher proportion of Internet users in the United States use Twitter than Internet users in other countries. Accordingly, in the future we expect our user growth rate in certain international markets to continue to be higher than our user growth rate in the United States. However, we expect to face challenges in entering some markets, such as China, where access to Twitter is blocked, as well as certain other countries that have intermittently restricted access to Twitter. Restrictions or limitations on access to Twitter may adversely impact our ability to increase the size of our user base and generate additional revenue in certain markets.\nWe do not separately track whether an MAU has only used Twitter on a desktop or on a mobile device. However, in the three months ended December 31, 2017, approximately 80% of our average MAUs accessed Twitter from a mobile device, roughly stable from the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nWe may face challenges in increasing the size of our user base, including, among others, competition from alternative products and services, a decline in the number of influential users on Twitter or a perceived decline in the quality of content or user experience available on Twitter. We intend to drive growth in our user base by building and shipping product changes more rapidly to make Twitter safer and investing in our core use case and in new product areas - such as live streaming video, among others - that further strengthen our unique position as the best and fastest place to see and talk about what's happening in the world. Our user growth rate has fluctuated over time, and it may slow or decline. To the extent our logged-in user growth or user growth rate continues to slow or the absolute number of logged in users declines, our revenue growth will become dependent on our ability to increase levels of user engagement on Twitter and increasing revenue growth from third-party publishers' websites and applications, data licensing and other offerings.\nMonetization. There are many variables that impact the monetization of our platform, such as the number of users, our users' level of engagement with our platform, ad load (which is a function of the amount of advertising we choose to display), our users' engagement with our Promoted Products, advertiser demand and cost per ad engagement. Generally, we design our algorithms for our pay-for-performance Promoted Products on Twitter to optimize the overall user experience and the value we deliver to advertisers. Advertising revenue growth may be impacted by escalating competition for digital ad spending and the reevaluation of our revenue product feature portfolio, which could result in the de-emphasis of certain product features. Furthermore, we may see a continuing decline in the number of advertisers on a year-over-year basis, which may also impact overall demand for our ads products. We have, and may in the future, increase ad load to the extent that we are able to continue to reach the right balance of advertiser value and the overall user experience. In order to improve monetization, we plan to increase the value of our advertising services by continuing to increase the size and engagement of our user base as well as improve our ability to target advertising to our users' interests and the ability of our advertisers to optimize their campaigns and measure the results of their campaigns.\nAlthough the majority of the Promoted Products we sell to our advertisers are placed on Twitter, we have augmented our advertising revenue by selling to advertisers our advertising products that we place on third-party publishers' websites, applications or other offerings. For the latter category of advertising placements, we incur additional costs, particularly traffic acquisition costs, to fulfill our services to advertisers. As we deprecated our TellApart offering in 2017, we expect contributions from our advertising products that we place on third-party publishers' websites and applications to face significant headwinds in 2018. TellApart revenue was $44.6 million in 2017, mainly in the first half of 2017, compared to $126.4 million in 2016.\nWe intend to continue to increase the monetization of our platform by improving the targeting capabilities of our advertising services to enhance the value of our Promoted Products for advertisers, delivering differentiated products to advertisers, and developing new ad formats for advertisers.\nEffectiveness of Our Advertising Services. Advertisers can use Twitter to communicate directly with their followers for free, but many choose to purchase our advertising services to reach a broader audience and further promote their brands, products and services. We believe that increasing the effectiveness of our Promoted Products for advertisers, as well as providing better measurement tools and improving creative capabilities, will increase the amount that advertisers spend with us. We aim to increase the value of our Promoted Products by increasing the size and engagement of our user base, improving our ability to target advertising to our users' interests and improving the ability of our advertisers to optimize their campaigns and measure the results of their campaigns. We may also develop new advertising products and services.\nInvestment in International Operations. We intend to strategically invest in our international operations in order to expand our user base and advertiser base and increase user engagement and monetization internationally. In the three months ended December 31, 2017, we had 262 million average MAUs internationally compared to 68 million average MAUs in the United States. In addition, our number of users is growing at a faster rate in many international markets. However, we derive the majority of our advertising revenue from advertisers in the United States.\nWe face challenges in increasing our advertising revenue internationally, including local competition, differences in advertiser demand, differences in the digital advertising market and conventions, and differences in the manner in which Twitter is accessed and used internationally. We face competition from well-established competitors in certain international markets. In addition, certain international markets are not as familiar with digital advertising in general, or with new forms of digital advertising, such as our Promoted Products. In these jurisdictions we are investing to educate advertisers about the benefits of our advertising services. However, we expect that it may require a significant investment of time and resources to educate advertisers in many international markets. We also face challenges in providing certain advertising products, features or analytics in certain international markets, such as the European Union, due to government regulation. In addition, in certain emerging markets, a significant portion of users still access Twitter through feature phones with limited functionality, rather than through smartphones, our website or desktop applications. This limits our ability to deliver certain features to these users and may limit the ability of advertisers to deliver compelling ads to users in these markets.\nCompetition. We face competition for users and advertisers. We compete against many companies to attract and engage users and for advertiser spend, including companies with greater financial resources and substantially larger user bases which offer a variety of Internet and mobile device-based products, services and content. In recent years there has been a significant number of acquisitions and consolidation activity by and among our actual and potential competitors. We must compete effectively for users and advertisers in order to grow our business and increase our revenue. We believe that our ability to compete effectively for users depends upon a number of factors, including the quality of our products and services and the actual or perceived return our advertisers receive on their investment in our products and services. Our ability to compete effectively for advertisers also depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to offer attractive advertising products with unique targeting capabilities and the size of our active user base. We have seen escalating competition for digital ad spending and expect this trend to continue. In addition, many advertisers, particularly branded advertisers use marketing mix analyses to determine how to allocate their advertising budgets on an annual or bi-annual basis. As a result, we need to demonstrate to those advertisers during the appropriate time period that we provide a better return on investment than our competitors do in order to secure, increase or sustain our share of the advertising budget allocated for a significant portion of the year until the next budget cycle. We intend to continue to invest in research and development to improve our products and services for users and advertisers and to grow our active user base in order to address the competitive challenges in our industry. As part of our strategy to improve our products and services, we may acquire other companies to add engineering talent or complementary products and technologies.\nInvestment in Infrastructure. We strive to optimize the capacity and enhance the capability and reliability of our infrastructure. Our infrastructure is critical to providing users, platform partners, advertisers and data partners access to our platform, particularly during major planned and unplanned events, such as elections, sporting events or natural disasters, when activity on our platform increases dramatically. As our user base and the activity on our platform grow, we expect that investments and expenses associated with our infrastructure will continue to grow. These investments and expenses include the expansion and improvement of our data center operations and related operating costs, additional servers and networking equipment to increase the capacity of our infrastructure and increased bandwidth costs.\nProducts and Services Innovation. Our ability to increase the size and engagement of our user base, attract advertisers and increase our revenue will depend, in part, on our ability to improve existing products and services and to successfully develop or acquire new products and services. We plan to continue to make significant investments in research and development and, from time to time, we may acquire companies to enhance our products, services and technical capabilities.\nInvestment in Talent. We intend to invest in hiring key roles and retaining talented employees to grow our business. We have seen high levels of attrition, and as a result, need to focus on hiring and employee retention to be successful. We have also made, and intend to continue to make, acquisitions that add engineers, designers, product managers and other personnel with specific technology expertise. In addition, we must retain our high-performing personnel in order to continue to develop, sell and market our products and services and manage our business.\nSeasonality. Advertising spending is traditionally strongest in the fourth quarter of each year. Historically, this seasonality in advertising spending has affected our quarterly results, with higher sequential advertising revenue growth from the third quarter to the fourth quarter compared to sequential advertising revenue growth from the fourth quarter to the subsequent first quarter. For example, our advertising revenue increased 25%, 17% and 28% between the third and fourth quarters of 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively, while advertising revenue for the first quarter of 2016 and 2017 decreased 17% and 26% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense. We have historically utilized, and intend to continue to utilize, various forms of stock-based awards in order to hire and retain talented employees. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recognized $433.8 million and $615.2 million of expense related to stock-based compensation, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of approximately $598.7 million related to outstanding equity awards, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of approximately two years. The stock-based compensation expenses related to our outstanding equity awards have a significant impact on the amount of net income we generate on a GAAP basis. We continued to make progress in reducing our annual stock-based compensation expense on both an absolute basis and as a percentage of revenue. We remain committed to reducing stock-based compensation to high single digits to low teens as a percentage of revenue over time, bringing us more in line with our peers.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our consolidated statement of operations data for each of the periods presented:\n\n (1) Costs and expenses include stock-based compensation expense as follows (in thousands): \n\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statement of operations data for each of the periods presented as a percentage of revenue:\n\nYears Ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015\nRevenue\nWe generate the substantial majority of our revenue from the sale of advertising services. We also generate revenue by licensing our data to third parties and providing mobile advertising exchange services.\nAdvertising Services\nWe generate most of our advertising revenue by selling our Promoted Products. Currently, our Promoted Products consist of the following:\n \u2022 Promoted Tweets. Promoted Tweets, which are labeled as promoted,\u201d appear within a user's timeline, search results or profile pages just like an ordinary Tweet regardless of device, whether it be desktop or mobile. Using our proprietary algorithms and understanding of the interests of each user, we can deliver Promoted Tweets that are intended to be relevant to a particular user. We enable our advertisers to target an audience based on our users' Interest Graphs. Our Promoted Tweets are pay-for-performance or pay-for-impression delivered advertising that are priced through an auction. Our Promoted Tweets include objective-based features that allow advertisers to pay only for the types of engagement selected by the advertisers, such as Tweet engagements (e.g., Retweets, replies and likes), website clicks or conversions, mobile application installs or engagements, obtaining new followers, or video views. \n \u2022 Promoted Accounts. Promoted Accounts, which are labeled as promoted,\u201d provide a way for our advertisers to grow a community of users who are interested in their business, products or services. Our Promoted Accounts are pay-for-performance advertising that is priced through an auction. \n \u2022 Promoted Trends. Promoted Trends, which are labeled as promoted,\u201d appear at the top of the list of trending topics or timeline for an entire day in a particular country or on a global basis. We sell our Promoted Trends on a fixed-fee-per-day basis. \nWhile the majority of the Promoted Products we sell to our advertisers are placed on Twitter, we also generate advertising revenue by placing advertising products that we sell to advertisers on third-party publishers' websites, applications or other offerings.\nData Licensing and Other\nWe generate data licensing and other revenue by (i) offering data products and data licenses that allow our data partners to access, search and analyze historical and real-time data on our platform, which data consists of public Tweets and their content, and (ii) providing mobile advertising exchange services through our MoPub exchange. Our data partners generally purchase licenses to access all or a portion of our data for a fixed period. We recognize data licensing revenue as the licensed data is made available to our data partners. In addition, we operate a mobile ad exchange and receive service fees from transactions completed on the exchange. Our mobile ad exchange enables buyers and sellers to purchase and sell advertising inventory and matches buyers and sellers. We have determined we are not the principal in the purchase and sale of advertising inventory in transactions between third-party buyers and sellers on the exchange. Therefore we report revenue related to our ad exchange services on a net basis.\n\n2017 Compared to 2016. Revenue in 2017 decreased by $86.3 million compared to 2016.\nIn 2017, advertising revenue decreased by 6% compared to 2016. The substantial majority of our advertising revenue was generated from our owned and operated platform. Advertising revenue generated from the sale of our advertising products on our owned and operated platform in 2017 was $1.90 billion as compared to $1.99 billion in 2016. Advertising revenue generated from the sale of our advertising products placed on third-party publishers' websites, applications and other offerings in 2017 was $211.2 million as compared to $260.2 million in 2016. The decrease in advertising revenue from the sale of our advertising products placed on third-party publishers' websites, applications and other offerings in 2017 was driven by significantly lower contribution from TellApart (which was deprecated in 2017), which was offset by strong performance from Twitter Audience Platform. TellApart revenue was $44.6 million in 2017, mainly in the first half of 2017, compared to $126.4 million in 2016.\nThe overall decrease in advertising revenue was primarily attributable to a 52% decrease in average cost per ad engagement offset by a 96% increase in the number of ad engagements in 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease in average cost per ad engagement reflects a higher mix of video ad engagements (which have overall lower cost per ad engagement compared to other ad formats) and lower cost per ad engagement across the majority of ad formats compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in ad engagements was driven by a continuing mix shift toward video ad impressions as well as higher click-through rates.\nAdvertising revenue continued to be driven by strong growth in our video ad formats offset by declines in traditional Promoted Tweet and direct response ad formats. As our user base and the level of engagement of our users grow, we believe the potential to increase our revenue grows.\nIn 2017, data licensing and other revenue increased by 18% compared to 2016. A majority of the increase was attributable to growth in data licensing fees from the offering of data products. We expect to continue to grow our data revenue with a new product and channel segmented go-to-market approach.\n2016 Compared to 2015. Revenue in 2016 increased by $311.6 million compared to 2015.\nIn 2016, advertising revenue increased by 13% compared to 2015. Foreign exchange effect did not have a material impact on advertising revenue in 2016. The substantial majority of our advertising revenue was generated from our owned and operated platform. Advertising revenue generated from the sale of our advertising products on our owned and operated platform in 2016 was $1.99 billion as compared to $1.80 billion in 2015. Advertising revenue generated from the sale of our advertising products placed on third-party publishers' websites, applications and other offerings in 2016 was $260.2 million as compared to $194.2 million in 2015, which increase was driven, in part, by the acquisition of TellApart in May 2015 and from the growth of sales in our organically-built advertising network, Twitter Audience Platform. The overall increase in advertising revenue was primarily attributable to a 152% increase in the number of ad engagements offset by a 55% decrease in average cost per ad engagement in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in ad engagements was driven by continued adoption of auto-play video and an increase in ad load. The decrease in average cost per ad engagement was due primarily to the shift to auto-play video, which delivers more engagement at a much lower average cost per engagement than click-to-play video ads and decreases in same-format prices for most of our other advertising products. Advertising revenue continued to be driven by growth in demand for our advertising products, particularly video as well as growth in our advertising base. Strength from our video ad format, however, was offset by year-over-year declines in revenue generated from our traditional Promoted Tweet ad format.\nIn 2016, data licensing and other revenue increased by 26% compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in mobile advertising exchange services and to a lesser extent an increase in data licensing fees from the offering of data products.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue includes infrastructure costs, other direct costs including content costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets and amortization of capitalized labor costs for internally developed software, allocated facilities costs, as well as traffic acquisition costs, or TAC. Infrastructure costs consist primarily of data center costs related to our co-located facilities, which include lease and hosting costs, related support and maintenance costs and energy and bandwidth costs; as well as depreciation of servers and networking equipment; and personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, for our operations teams. TAC consists of costs we incur with third parties in connection with the sale to advertisers of our advertising products that we place on third-party publishers' websites, applications or other offerings collectively resulting from acquisitions, and from our organically-built advertising network, Twitter Audience Platform. Many of the elements of our cost of revenue are fixed, and cannot be reduced in the near term.\n\n2017 Compared to 2016. In 2017, cost of revenue decreased by $71.0 million compared to 2016. The decrease was attributable to a $48.6 million decrease in restructuring expenses, a $45.3 million decrease in infrastructure costs, a $42.7 million decrease in TAC substantially due to the decrease in advertising revenue generated from TellApart (which we deprecated in 2017), and a $3.5 million decrease in personnel-related costs. These decreases were offset by a $55.5 million increase in other direct costs that is primarily driven by an increase in content costs, and a $13.6 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily related to additional internally developed software, server and networking equipment.\n2016 Compared to 2015. In 2016, cost of revenue, which included TAC of $141.6 million, increased by $203.0 million compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to a $63.4 million increase in networking, hosting and data center costs related to our co-located facilities, a $54.6 million increase in depreciation expense related to additional server and networking equipment and amortization of acquired intangible assets, a $47.9 million increase in restructuring expenses as a result of lease write-offs, a $40.0 million increase in other direct costs, and a $19.7 million increase in TAC. The increases were offset by a $22.6 million decrease in personnel-related costs, mainly driven by a decrease in average employee headcount and compensation expense.\nWe plan to continue to scale the capacity and enhance the capability and reliability of our infrastructure to support user growth and increased activity on our platform. We also expect that the amount of revenue generated from the sale of our advertising services on third-party publishers' websites, applications and other offerings will vary. As a result, we expect that cost of revenue will vary in absolute dollar amounts for the foreseeable future and vary in the near term from period to period as a percentage of revenue.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, for our engineers and other employees engaged in the research and development of our products and services. In addition, research and development expenses include amortization of acquired intangible assets, allocated facilities and other supporting overhead costs.\n\n2017 Compared to 2016. In 2017, research and development expenses decreased by $171.5 million compared to 2016. The decrease was attributable to a $141.6 million decrease in personnel-related costs, mainly driven by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense, a $25.9 million decrease in restructuring charges net of a one-time nonrecurring gain on sale of assets in 2017, a $23.7 million decrease in allocated facilities and other supporting overhead expenses due to a decrease in overall total expenses, a $2.6 million decrease in other expenses, and a $2.5 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense, offset by a $24.8 million decrease in the capitalization of costs associated with developing software for internal use.\n2016 Compared to 2015. In 2016, research and development expenses decreased by $93.2 million compared to 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $69.1 million decrease in personnel-related costs, mainly driven by a decrease in compensation expense from a decrease in average employee headcount, a $42.7 million increase in the capitalization of costs associated with developing software for internal use due primarily to an increase in the number of projects as we refine our core services, and a $2.5 million decrease in other expenses. The decreases were offset by a $9.1 million increase in allocated facilities and other supporting overhead expenses, a $7.2 million increase in restructuring expenses and a $4.8 million increase in depreciation expense.\nWe plan to continue to invest in key areas of our business to ensure that we have the right level of engineering, product management and design teams to support our research and development efforts. We expect that both research and development headcount and costs in absolute dollars will increase in the near term but will vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, commissions, benefits and stock-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, business development and media, marketing, corporate communications and customer service functions. In addition, marketing and sales-related expenses also include advertising costs, market research, tradeshows, branding, marketing, public relations costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, as well as allocated facilities and other supporting overhead costs.\n\n2017 Compared to 2016. In 2017, sales and marketing expenses decreased by $240.4 million compared to 2016. The decrease was attributable to a $116.0 million decrease in personnel-related costs, driven by a decrease in average employee headcount mainly as a result of our 2016 restructuring plan, a $54.0 million decrease in marketing and sales-related expenses, a $28.0 million decrease in allocated facilities and other supporting overhead expenses due to a decrease in overall total expenses, a $27.4 million decrease in restructuring expenses, and a $15.0 million decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets.\n2016 Compared to 2015. In 2016, sales and marketing expenses increased by $86.3 million compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to a $31.9 million increase in allocated facilities and other supporting overhead expenses due to the increase in support functions, a $27.6 million increase in restructuring expenses mainly driven by a reduction in workforce at the end of 2016, a $21.8 million increase in personnel-related costs, mainly driven by an increase in compensation expense, and a $16.5 million increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets, offset by an $11.5 million decrease in marketing and sales-related expenses.\nWe continue to evaluate key areas in our business to ensure we have the right level of sales and marketing to execute on our key priorities and objectives. We expect that both sales and marketing headcount and costs in absolute dollars will increase in the near term but will vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, for our executive, finance, legal, information technology, human resources and other administrative employees. In addition, general and administrative expenses include fees and costs for professional services, including consulting, third-party legal and accounting services and facilities and other supporting overhead costs that are not allocated to other departments.\n\n2017 Compared to 2016. In 2017, general and administrative expense decreased by $9.4 million compared to 2016. The decrease was attributable to a $9.2 million decrease in personnel-related costs, mainly driven by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense, a $4.9 million decrease in facilities and supporting costs, and a $4.8 million decrease in restructuring charges. The decreases were offset by a $9.0 million increase in fees and costs for professional services, and a $0.5 million increase in other expenses.\n2016 Compared to 2015. In 2016, general and administrative expense increased by $32.6 million compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to a $17.1 million increase in personnel-related costs, driven by an increase in compensation expense from an increase in average employee headcount, a $6.8 million increase in facilities and supporting costs not allocated to other functions, a $6.5 million increase in fees and costs for professional services, and a $5.6 million increase in restructuring expenses. The increases were offset by a $3.4 million increase in the capitalization of costs associated with developing software for internal use.\nWe plan to continue to invest in key areas of our business and ensure that we have the right level of general and administrative support on our key priorities and objectives. We expect that general and administrative expenses will vary in the near term from period to period as a percentage of revenue.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest expense incurred in connection with the $935.0 million principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes due 2019, or the 2019 Notes, and $954.0 million principal amount of 1.00% convertible senior notes due 2021, or the 2021 Notes and together with the 2019 Notes, the Notes, and interest expense related to capital leases and other financing facilities.\n\n2017 Compared to 2016. In 2017, interest expense increased by $5.3 million compared to 2016. Interest expense in 2017 was comprised of $99.6 million of total interest expense related to the Notes as well as our credit facility (described below) and $5.6 million related to capital leases of equipment.\n2016 Compared to 2015. In 2016, interest expense increased by $1.8 million compared to 2015. Interest expense in 2016 was comprised of $94.5 million of total interest expense related to the Notes as well as our credit facility and $5.5 million related to capital leases of equipment.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net, consists primarily of interest income resulting from our short-term investments net of the related amortization of premium paid on such investments, and unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses due to re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies as well as realized foreign exchange gains and losses on foreign exchange transactions. We expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates.\n\n2017 Compared to 2016. In 2017, other expense, net, was $28.9 million compared to other income, net, of $26.3 million in 2016. The change was primarily attributable to the recording of an other-than-temporary impairment on a cost-method investment of $62.4 million in 2017 and less favorable foreign currency exchange impacts from foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities as well as derivative financial instruments, offset by an increase in interest income on our short term investments.\nOther expense, net, in 2017 was comprised of $62.4 million of other-than-temporary impairment on a cost-method investment, $8.8 million of foreign currency exchange net loss, and $1.0 million of other expense, offset by $43.3 million of interest and other income.\n2016 Compared to 2015. In 2016, other income, net, increased by $11.4 million compared to 2015. The increase was attributable to an increase in interest income on our short term investments and favorable foreign currency exchange impacts from foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities as well as derivative financial instruments, offset by an increase in other expenses.\nOther income, net, in 2016 was comprised of $25.3 million of interest and other income and $5.8 million of foreign currency exchange gain, offset by $4.8 million of other expenses.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes consists of federal and state income taxes in the United States and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions which are expected to fluctuate based on the pre-tax results within and outside of the United States and will also be impacted by our allocation of centrally incurred costs to foreign jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rate will also be affected by the changes in tax rates and tax regulations, the impact of tax examinations, the impact of business combinations, and changes in valuation allowance. In addition, the provision is impacted by deferred income taxes and changes in the related valuation allowance reflecting the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.\nIn December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d), was signed into law. Among other provisions, the Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result, we were required to re-measure our net deferred tax assets, which resulted in a reduction of our deferred tax assets by $352.9 million, with a corresponding decrease to the valuation allowance of the same amount. We are in the process of assessing the impact of the international tax provisions provided for in the Tax Act that would apply for calendar years 2018 onwards. We are not, however, subject to the one-time mandatory transition tax.\n\n2017 Compared to 2016. Our provision for income taxes in 2017 decreased by $3.4 million compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in the income tax benefit arising from intraperiod allocation and partial release of valuation allowance attributable to the Tax Act related to AMT tax credits.\n2016 Compared to 2015. Our provision for income taxes in 2016 changed by $28.3 million compared to a benefit of $12.3 million in 2015. The increase was primarily due to a decrease in the income tax benefit arising from acquisitions of $24.2 million, and by an increase in income tax expense in foreign jurisdictions of $4.1 million. The $24.2 million decrease in income tax benefit is related to the release of deferred tax valuation allowance resulting from acquisitions completed within the prior year. The deferred tax liabilities recorded in the prior year, as part of purchase accounting, provided an additional source of taxable income to support the realizability of pre-existing deferred tax assets. In the year ended December 31, 2016, the acquisitions we completed did not result in a release of deferred tax valuation allowance due to acquisitions either in a foreign jurisdiction with no valuation allowance or offsetting acquired deferred tax assets.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $3.43 billion of federal and $1.47 billion of state net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income. These net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire for federal income tax purposes and state income tax purposes in 2027 and 2018, respectively. We also have research credit carryforwards of $259.6 million and $208.6 million for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. The federal research credit carryforward will begin to expire in 2027. The state research credit carryforward has no expiration date. Additionally, we have California Enterprise Zone credit carryforwards of $19.1 million which will begin to expire in 2023. Utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards and research credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state provisions. Any annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and research credits before utilization.\nUpon adoption of the stock-based compensation expense simplification rule including the income tax consequences; and the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets resulting from the enactment of the Tax Act, as of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $782.3 million of federal and $222.8 million of state net deferred tax assets. Concurrently, we set up a valuation allowance against all but $2.0 million of these deferred tax assets. As of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 we completed our reassessment of the realizability of these assets and have concluded that a valuation allowance is still required.\nEvaluating the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets often requires significant judgment and extensive analysis of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not (a probability level of more than 50%) that these assets will be realized. In completing this assessment management must consider both objective and subjective factors in its assessment. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n \u2022 Future reversal of existing temporary differences \n \u2022 Tax-planning strategies \n \u2022 Future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and loss carryforwards \nAs we continue to make significant strides in optimizing operations resulting in improved financial results, our future reassessment is likely to result in the determination that a valuation allowance is no longer required. This would result in such future financial reporting period in a significant reversal of the valuation allowance and a corresponding material non-cash income tax benefit and the recording of additional deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. Based on recent earnings in certain jurisdictions, sufficient positive evidence may exist within the 2018 calendar year such that we may release a significant portion of our valuation allowance.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our unaudited consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2017. The unaudited quarterly statement of operations data set forth below have been prepared on a basis consistent with our audited annual consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and include, in our opinion, all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the financial information contained in those statements. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in the future. The following quarterly financial data should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplemental Data\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFY 2017 Overview and Highlights\nTotal revenue was $2.44 billion, a decrease of 3% compared to 2016.\n \u2022 Advertising revenue totaled $2.11 billion, a decrease of 6% compared to 2016. \n \u2022 Data licensing and other revenue totaled $333.3 million, an increase of 18% compared to 2016. \n \u2022 U.S. revenue totaled $1.41 billion, a decrease of 10% compared to 2016. \n \u2022 International revenue totaled $1.03 billion, an increase of 7% compared to 2016. \n \u2022 Total ad engagements increased 96% year-over-year. \n \u2022 Cost per engagement decreased 52% year-over-year. \nNet loss was $108.1 million, a decrease of 76% compared to 2016.\nNon-GAAP net income was $328.9 million, an increase of 24% compared to 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $863.0 million, an increase of 15% compared to 2016.\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in marketable securities totaled $4.40 billion as of December 31, 2017.\nAverage monthly active users were 330 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 4% compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nAverage daily active usage for the three months ended December 31, 2017 grew 12% year-over-year.\nKey Metrics\nWe review a number of metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions.\nMonthly Active Users (MAUs). We define MAUs as Twitter users who logged in or were otherwise authenticated and accessed Twitter through our website, mobile website, desktop or mobile applications, SMS or registered third-party applications or websites in the 30-day period ending on the date of measurement. Average MAUs for a period represent the average of the MAUs at the end of each month during the period. MAUs are a measure of the size of our logged in or otherwise authenticated active user base. In the three months ended December 31, 2017, we had 330 million average MAUs, which represents an increase of 4% from the three months ended December 31, 2016(1). The growth in average MAUs was driven by a combination of organic growth, marketing, and product improvements, including the ongoing benefits of improved relevance in email, push notifications and the timeline. In the three months ended December 31, 2017, we had 68 million average MAUs in the United States and 262 million average MAUs in the rest of the world, which represent increases of 2% and 4%, respectively, from the three months ended December 31, 2016. For additional information on how we calculate MAUs and factors that can affect this metric, see the section titled Note Regarding Key Metrics.\u201d\nMAU growth is historically seasonally weak in the fourth quarter. In addition, a recent change was made to Safari's integration with third-party applications including Twitter that resulted in a decrease of approximately 2 million MAUs that accessed Twitter by using registered third-party applications when those applications automatically contact our servers for regular updates without discernible user-initiated action, which we refer to as third-party auto-polling MAU. However, we do not serve ads to this subset of MAUs and as a result, no revenue is generated from such MAUs. MAU in the fourth quarter was also impacted by increased information quality efforts, which are our overall efforts to reduce malicious activity on the service, inclusive of spam, malicious automation, and fake accounts.\n \n(1) Reported average Monthly Active Users reflects adjustments for approximately 1-2 million users per quarter of certain third-party applications that were included as Twitter MAUs that should not have been considered MAUs in certain prior periods. Daily Active Usage was not affected. Further details regarding the adjustment can be found in the section titled \"Note About Our MAU Adjustment.\"\nNote About Our MAU Adjustment\nIn the third quarter of 2017, we discovered that since the fourth quarter of 2014 we had included users of certain third-party applications as Twitter MAUs that should not have been considered MAUs. These third-party applications used Digits, a software development kit of our now-divested Fabric platform, that allowed third-party applications to send authentication messages via SMS through our systems, which did not relate to activity on the Twitter platform. The table below presents the impact for the periods beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016. Due to our data retention policies, we do not have data to reconcile periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2016, but our estimates suggest the prior period adjustments are smaller than those in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nTable 188: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three Months Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three Months Ended March 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three Months Ended June 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Worldwide\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Worldwide\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Worldwide\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Previously Reported MAU\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustment (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted MAU\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (1) The difference between Adjusted MAU and Previously Reported MAU does not correspond to the amount of the Adjustment due to rounding.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nChanges in Daily Active Users/Daily Active Usage (DAU). We define daily active users or daily active usage as Twitter users who logged in or were otherwise authenticated and accessed Twitter through our website, mobile website or mobile applications on any given day. Average DAU for a period represents the number of DAUs on each day of such period divided by the number of days for such period. Changes in DAU are a measure of changes in the size of our daily logged in or otherwise authenticated active user base. To calculate the year-over-year change in DAUs, we subtract the average DAU for the three months ended in the previous year from the average DAU for the same three months ended in the current year and divide the result by the average DAU for the three months ended in the previous year. Prior to reporting results for the third quarter of 2016, we had discussed DAUs and the ratio of MAUs to DAUs. In those instances, for comparability and consistency with MAUs, DAUs also included users who accessed Twitter through our desktop applications and third-party properties. For additional information on how we calculate changes in DAUs and factors that can affect this metric, see the section titled Note Regarding Key Metrics.\u201d Reported DAU metrics were not impacted by the MAU adjustment discussed above as DAU do not include users from third-party applications.\nDAU grew faster than MAU in the fourth quarter of 2017 as we continued to benefit from organic growth, product and marketing investments made in this quarter and in prior periods.\nChanges in Ad Engagements and Cost per Ad Engagement. We define an ad engagement as a user interaction with one of our pay-for-performance advertising products. Ad engagements with our advertising products are based on a user completing an objective set out by an advertiser such as expanding, Retweeting, liking or replying to a Promoted Tweet, viewing an embedded video, downloading or engaging with a promoted mobile application, clicking on a website link, signing up for marketing emails from advertisers, following the account that tweets a Promoted Tweet, or completing a transaction on an external website. We believe changes in ad engagements is one way to measure user engagement with our advertising products. We believe changes in cost per ad engagement is one way to measure demand.\nIn the three months ended December 31, 2017, ad engagements increased 75% from the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase was driven by a continuing mix shift toward video ad impressions as well as higher click-through rates. In the three months ended December 31, 2017, average cost per ad engagement decreased 42% from the three months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in cost per ad engagement reflects a higher mix of video ad engagements (which have overall lower cost per ad engagement compared to other ad formats) and lower cost per ad engagement across the majority of ad formats compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFactors Affecting Our Future Performance\nUser Growth and Monetization. User growth trends reflected in the number of MAUs, changes in DAUs and monetization trends reflected in advertising engagements are key factors that affect our revenue. As our user base and the level of engagement of our users grow, we believe the potential to increase our revenue grows.\nUser Growth. We have generally experienced growth in our number of users over the last several years. In general, a higher proportion of Internet users in the United States use Twitter than Internet users in other countries. Accordingly, in the future we expect our user growth rate in certain international markets to continue to be higher than our user growth rate in the United States. However, we expect to face challenges in entering some markets, such as China, where access to Twitter is blocked, as well as certain other countries that have intermittently restricted access to Twitter. Restrictions or limitations on access to Twitter may adversely impact our ability to increase the size of our user base and generate additional revenue in certain markets.\nWe do not separately track whether an MAU has only used Twitter on a desktop or on a mobile device. However, in the three months ended December 31, 2017, approximately 80% of our average MAUs accessed Twitter from a mobile device, roughly stable from the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nWe may face challenges in increasing the size of our user base, including, among others, competition from alternative products and services, a decline in the number of influential users on Twitter or a perceived decline in the quality of content or user experience available on Twitter. We intend to drive growth in our user base by building and shipping product changes more rapidly to make Twitter safer and investing in our core use case and in new product areas - such as live streaming video, among others - that further strengthen our unique position as the best and fastest place to see and talk about what's happening in the world. Our user growth rate has fluctuated over time, and it may slow or decline. To the extent our logged-in user growth or user growth rate continues to slow or the absolute number of logged in users declines, our revenue growth will become dependent on our ability to increase levels of user engagement on Twitter and increasing revenue growth from third-party publishers' websites and applications, data licensing and other offerings.\nMonetization. There are many variables that impact the monetization of our platform, such as the number of users, our users' level of engagement with our platform, ad load (which is a function of the amount of advertising we choose to display), our users' engagement with our Promoted Products, advertiser demand and cost per ad engagement. Generally, we design our algorithms for our pay-for-performance Promoted Products on Twitter to optimize the overall user experience and the value we deliver to advertisers. Advertising revenue growth may be impacted by escalating competition for digital ad spending and the reevaluation of our revenue product feature portfolio, which could result in the de-emphasis of certain product features. Furthermore, we may see a continuing decline in the number of advertisers on a year-over-year basis, which may also impact overall demand for our ads products. We have, and may in the future, increase ad load to the extent that we are able to continue to reach the right balance of advertiser value and the overall user experience. In order to improve monetization, we plan to increase the value of our advertising services by continuing to increase the size and engagement of our user base as well as improve our ability to target advertising to our users' interests and the ability of our advertisers to optimize their campaigns and measure the results of their campaigns.\nAlthough the majority of the Promoted Products we sell to our advertisers are placed on Twitter, we have augmented our advertising revenue by selling to advertisers our advertising products that we place on third-party publishers' websites, applications or other offerings. For the latter category of advertising placements, we incur additional costs, particularly traffic acquisition costs, to fulfill our services to advertisers. As we deprecated our TellApart offering in 2017, we expect contributions from our advertising products that we place on third-party publishers' websites and applications to face significant headwinds in 2018. TellApart revenue was $44.6 million in 2017, mainly in the first half of 2017, compared to $126.4 million in 2016.\nWe intend to continue to increase the monetization of our platform by improving the targeting capabilities of our advertising services to enhance the value of our Promoted Products for advertisers, delivering differentiated products to advertisers, and developing new ad formats for advertisers.\nEffectiveness of Our Advertising Services. Advertisers can use Twitter to communicate directly with their followers for free, but many choose to purchase our advertising services to reach a broader audience and further promote their brands, products and services. We believe that increasing the effectiveness of our Promoted Products for advertisers, as well as providing better measurement tools and improving creative capabilities, will increase the amount that advertisers spend with us. We aim to increase the value of our Promoted Products by increasing the size and engagement of our user base, improving our ability to target advertising to our users' interests and improving the ability of our advertisers to optimize their campaigns and measure the results of their campaigns. We may also develop new advertising products and services.\nInvestment in International Operations. We intend to strategically invest in our international operations in order to expand our user base and advertiser base and increase user engagement and monetization internationally. In the three months ended December 31, 2017, we had 262 million average MAUs internationally compared to 68 million average MAUs in the United States. In addition, our number of users is growing at a faster rate in many international markets. However, we derive the majority of our advertising revenue from advertisers in the United States.\nWe face challenges in increasing our advertising revenue internationally, including local competition, differences in advertiser demand, differences in the digital advertising market and conventions, and differences in the manner in which Twitter is accessed and used internationally. We face competition from well-established competitors in certain international markets. In addition, certain international markets are not as familiar with digital advertising in general, or with new forms of digital advertising, such as our Promoted Products. In these jurisdictions we are investing to educate advertisers about the benefits of our advertising services. However, we expect that it may require a significant investment of time and resources to educate advertisers in many international markets. We also face challenges in providing certain advertising products, features or analytics in certain international markets, such as the European Union, due to government regulation. In addition, in certain emerging markets, a significant portion of users still access Twitter through feature phones with limited functionality, rather than through smartphones, our website or desktop applications. This limits our ability to deliver certain features to these users and may limit the ability of advertisers to deliver compelling ads to users in these markets.\nCompetition. We face competition for users and advertisers. We compete against many companies to attract and engage users and for advertiser spend, including companies with greater financial resources and substantially larger user bases which offer a variety of Internet and mobile device-based products, services and content. In recent years there has been a significant number of acquisitions and consolidation activity by and among our actual and potential competitors. We must compete effectively for users and advertisers in order to grow our business and increase our revenue. We believe that our ability to compete effectively for users depends upon a number of factors, including the quality of our products and services and the actual or perceived return our advertisers receive on their investment in our products and services. Our ability to compete effectively for advertisers also depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to offer attractive advertising products with unique targeting capabilities and the size of our active user base. We have seen escalating competition for digital ad spending and expect this trend to continue. In addition, many advertisers, particularly branded advertisers use marketing mix analyses to determine how to allocate their advertising budgets on an annual or bi-annual basis. As a result, we need to demonstrate to those advertisers during the appropriate time period that we provide a better return on investment than our competitors do in order to secure, increase or sustain our share of the advertising budget allocated for a significant portion of the year until the next budget cycle. We intend to continue to invest in research and development to improve our products and services for users and advertisers and to grow our active user base in order to address the competitive challenges in our industry. As part of our strategy to improve our products and services, we may acquire other companies to add engineering talent or complementary products and technologies.\nInvestment in Infrastructure. We strive to optimize the capacity and enhance the capability and reliability of our infrastructure. Our infrastructure is critical to providing users, platform partners, advertisers and data partners access to our platform, particularly during major planned and unplanned events, such as elections, sporting events or natural disasters, when activity on our platform increases dramatically. As our user base and the activity on our platform grow, we expect that investments and expenses associated with our infrastructure will continue to grow. These investments and expenses include the expansion and improvement of our data center operations and related operating costs, additional servers and networking equipment to increase the capacity of our infrastructure and increased bandwidth costs.\nProducts and Services Innovation. Our ability to increase the size and engagement of our user base, attract advertisers and increase our revenue will depend, in part, on our ability to improve existing products and services and to successfully develop or acquire new products and services. We plan to continue to make significant investments in research and development and, from time to time, we may acquire companies to enhance our products, services and technical capabilities.\nInvestment in Talent. We intend to invest in hiring key roles and retaining talented employees to grow our business. We have seen high levels of attrition, and as a result, need to focus on hiring and employee retention to be successful. We have also made, and intend to continue to make, acquisitions that add engineers, designers, product managers and other personnel with specific technology expertise. In addition, we must retain our high-performing personnel in order to continue to develop, sell and market our products and services and manage our business.\nSeasonality. Advertising spending is traditionally strongest in the fourth quarter of each year. Historically, this seasonality in advertising spending has affected our quarterly results, with higher sequential advertising revenue growth from the third quarter to the fourth quarter compared to sequential advertising revenue growth from the fourth quarter to the subsequent first quarter. For example, our advertising revenue increased 25%, 17% and 28% between the third and fourth quarters of 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively, while advertising revenue for the first quarter of 2016 and 2017 decreased 17% and 26% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense. We have historically utilized, and intend to continue to utilize, various forms of stock-based awards in order to hire and retain talented employees. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recognized $433.8 million and $615.2 million of expense related to stock-based compensation, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of approximately $598.7 million related to outstanding equity awards, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of approximately two years. The stock-based compensation expenses related to our outstanding equity awards have a significant impact on the amount of net income we generate on a GAAP basis. We continued to make progress in reducing our annual stock-based compensation expense on both an absolute basis and as a percentage of revenue. We remain committed to reducing stock-based compensation to high single digits to low teens as a percentage of revenue over time, bringing us more in line with our peers.\nResults of Operations\nThe

substantial majority of our revenue from the sale of advertising services. We also generate revenue by licensing our data to third parties and providing mobile advertising exchange services.\nAdvertising Services\nWe generate most of our advertising revenue by selling our Promoted Products. Currently, our Promoted Products consist of the following:\n \u2022 Promoted Tweets. Promoted Tweets, which are labeled as promoted,\u201d appear within a user's timeline, search results or profile pages just like an ordinary Tweet regardless of device, whether it be desktop or mobile. Using our proprietary algorithms and understanding of the interests of each user, we can deliver Promoted Tweets that are intended to be relevant to a particular user. We enable our advertisers to target an audience based on our users' Interest Graphs. Our Promoted Tweets are pay-for-performance or pay-for-impression delivered advertising that are priced through an auction. Our Promoted Tweets include objective-based features that allow advertisers to pay only for the types of engagement selected by the advertisers, such as Tweet engagements (e.g., Retweets, replies and likes), website clicks or conversions, mobile application installs or engagements, obtaining new followers, or video views. \n \u2022 Promoted Accounts. Promoted Accounts, which are labeled as promoted,\u201d provide a way for our advertisers to grow a community of users who are interested in their business, products or services. Our Promoted Accounts are pay-for-performance advertising that is priced through an auction. \n \u2022 Promoted Trends. Promoted Trends, which are labeled as promoted,\u201d appear at the top of the list of trending topics or timeline for an entire day in a particular country or on a global basis. We sell our Promoted Trends on a fixed-fee-per-day basis. \nWhile the majority of the Promoted Products we sell to our advertisers are placed on Twitter, we also generate advertising revenue by placing advertising products that we sell to advertisers on third-party publishers' websites, applications or other offerings.\nData Licensing and Other\nWe generate data licensing and other revenue by (i) offering data products and data licenses that allow our data partners to access, search and analyze historical and real-time data on our platform, which data consists of public Tweets and their content, and (ii) providing mobile advertising exchange services through our MoPub exchange. Our data partners generally purchase licenses to access all or a portion of our data for a fixed period. We recognize data licensing revenue as the licensed data is made available to our data partners. In addition, we operate a mobile ad exchange and receive service fees from transactions completed on the exchange. Our mobile ad exchange enables buyers and sellers to purchase and sell advertising inventory and matches buyers and sellers. We have determined we are not the principal in the purchase and sale of advertising inventory in transactions between third-party buyers and sellers on the exchange. Therefore we report revenue related to our ad exchange services on a net basis.\nTable 196: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2016 to 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015 to 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Advertising services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,109,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,248,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,994,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Data licensing and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 333,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 281,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 223,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,443,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,529,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,218,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 Compared to 2016. Revenue in 2017 decreased by $86.3 million compared to 2016.\nIn 2017, advertising revenue decreased by 6% compared to 2016. The substantial majority of our advertising revenue was generated from our owned and operated platform. Advertising revenue generated from the sale of our advertising products on our owned and operated platform in 2017 was $1.90 billion as compared to $1.99 billion in 2016. Advertising revenue generated from the sale of our advertising products placed on third-party publishers' websites, applications and other offerings in 2017 was $211.2 million as compared to $260.2 million in 2016. The decrease in advertising revenue from the sale of our advertising products placed on third-party publishers' websites, applications and other offerings in 2017 was driven by significantly lower contribution from TellApart (which was deprecated in 2017), which was offset by strong performance from Twitter Audience Platform. TellApart revenue was $44.6 million in 2017, mainly in the first half of 2017, compared to $126.4 million in 2016.\nThe overall decrease in advertising revenue was primarily attributable to a 52% decrease in average cost per ad engagement offset by a 96% increase in the number of ad engagements in 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease in average cost per ad engagement reflects a higher mix of video ad engagements (which have overall lower cost per ad engagement compared to other ad formats) and lower cost per ad engagement across the majority of ad formats compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in ad engagements was driven by a continuing mix shift toward video ad impressions as well as higher click-through rates.\nAdvertising revenue continued to be driven by strong growth in our video ad formats offset by declines in traditional Promoted Tweet and direct response ad formats. As our user base and the level of engagement of our users grow, we believe the potential to increase our revenue grows.\nIn 2017, data licensing and other revenue increased by 18% compared to 2016. A majority of the increase was attributable to growth in data licensing fees from the offering of data products. We expect to continue to grow our data revenue with a new product and channel segmented go-to-market approach.\n2016 Compared to 2015. Revenue in 2016 increased by $311.6 million compared to 2015.\nIn 2016, advertising revenue increased by 13% compared to 2015. Foreign exchange effect did not have a material impact on advertising revenue in 2016. The substantial majority of our advertising revenue was generated from our owned and operated platform. Advertising revenue generated from the sale of our advertising products on our owned and operated platform in 2016 was $1.99 billion as compared to $1.80 billion in 2015. Advertising revenue generated from the sale of our advertising products placed on third-party publishers' websites, applications and other offerings in 2016 was $260.2 million as compared to $194.2 million in 2015, which increase was driven, in part, by the acquisition of TellApart in May 2015 and from the growth of sales in our organically-built advertising network, Twitter Audience Platform. The overall increase in advertising revenue was primarily attributable to a 152% increase in the number of ad engagements offset by a 55% decrease in average cost per ad engagement in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in ad engagements was driven by continued adoption of auto-play video and an increase in ad load. The decrease in average cost per ad engagement was due primarily to the shift to auto-play video, which delivers more engagement at a much lower average cost per engagement than click-to-play video ads and decreases in same-format prices for most of our other advertising products. Advertising revenue continued to be driven by growth in demand for our advertising products, particularly video as well as growth in our advertising base. Strength from our video ad format, however, was offset by year-over-year declines in revenue generated from our traditional Promoted Tweet ad format.\nIn 2016, data licensing and other revenue increased by 26% compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in mobile advertising exchange services and to a lesser extent an increase in data licensing fees from the offering of data products.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue includes infrastructure costs, other direct costs including content costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets and amortization of capitalized labor costs for internally developed software, allocated facilities costs, as well as traffic acquisition costs, or TAC. Infrastructure costs consist primarily of data center costs related to our co-located facilities, which include lease and hosting costs, related support and maintenance costs and energy and bandwidth costs; as well as depreciation of servers and networking equipment; and personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, for our operations teams. TAC consists of costs we incur with third parties in connection with the sale to advertisers of our advertising products that we place on third-party publishers' websites, applications or other offerings collectively resulting from acquisitions, and from our organically-built advertising network, Twitter Audience Platform. Many of the elements of our cost of revenue are fixed, and cannot be reduced in the near term.\nTable 197: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2016 to 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015 to 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 861,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 932,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 729,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 Compared to 2016. In 2017, cost of revenue decreased by $71.0 million compared to 2016. The decrease was attributable to a $48.6 million decrease in restructuring expenses, a $45.3 million decrease in infrastructure costs, a $42.7 million decrease in TAC substantially due to the decrease in advertising revenue generated from TellApart (which we deprecated in 2017), and a $3.5 million decrease in personnel-related costs. These decreases were offset by a $55.5 million increase in other direct costs that is primarily driven by an increase in content costs, and a $13.6 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily related to additional internally developed software, server and networking equipment.\n2016 Compared to 2015. In 2016, cost of revenue, which included TAC of $141.6 million, increased by $203.0 million compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to a $63.4 million increase in networking, hosting and data center costs related to our co-located facilities, a $54.6 million increase in depreciation expense related to additional server and networking equipment and amortization of acquired intangible assets, a $47.9 million increase in restructuring expenses as a result of lease write-offs, a $40.0 million increase in other direct costs, and a $19.7 million increase in TAC. The increases were offset by a $22.6 million decrease in personnel-related costs, mainly driven by a decrease in average employee headcount and compensation expense.\nWe plan to continue to scale the capacity and enhance the capability and reliability of our infrastructure to support user growth and increased activity on our platform. We also expect that the amount of revenue generated from the sale of our advertising services on third-party publishers' websites, applications and other offerings will vary. As a result, we expect that cost of revenue will vary in absolute dollar amounts for the foreseeable future and vary in the near term from period to period as a percentage of revenue.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, for our engineers and other employees engaged in the research and development of our products and services. In addition, research and development expenses include amortization of acquired intangible assets, allocated facilities and other supporting overhead costs.\nTable 198: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2016 to 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015 to 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 542,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 713,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 806,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 Compared to 2016. In 2017, research and development expenses decreased by $171.5 million compared to 2016. The decrease was attributable to a $141.6 million decrease in personnel-related costs, mainly driven by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense, a $25.9 million decrease in restructuring charges net of a one-time nonrecurring gain on sale of assets in 2017, a $23.7 million decrease in allocated facilities and other supporting overhead expenses due to a decrease in overall total expenses, a $2.6 million decrease in other expenses, and a $2.5 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense, offset by a $24.8 million decrease in the capitalization of costs associated with developing software for internal use.\n2016 Compared to 2015. In 2016, research and development expenses decreased by $93.2 million compared to 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $69.1 million decrease in personnel-related costs, mainly driven by a decrease in compensation expense from a decrease in average employee headcount, a $42.7 million increase in the capitalization of costs associated with developing software for internal use due primarily to an increase in the number of projects as we refine our core services, and a $2.5 million decrease in other expenses. The decreases were offset by a $9.1 million increase in allocated facilities and other supporting overhead expenses, a $7.2 million increase in restructuring expenses and a $4.8 million increase in depreciation expense.\nWe plan to continue to invest in key areas of our business to ensure that we have the right level of engineering, product management and design teams to support our research and development efforts. We expect that both research and development headcount and costs in absolute dollars will increase in the near term but will vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, commissions, benefits and stock-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, business development and media, marketing, corporate communications and customer service functions. In addition, marketing and sales-related expenses also include advertising costs, market research, tradeshows, branding, marketing, public relations costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, as well as allocated facilities and other supporting overhead costs.\nTable 199: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2016 to 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015 to 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 717,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 957,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 871,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (25\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 Compared to 2016. In 2017, sales and marketing expenses decreased by $240.4 million compared to 2016. The decrease was attributable to a $116.0 million decrease in personnel-related costs, driven by a decrease in average employee headcount mainly as a result of our 2016 restructuring plan, a $54.0 million decrease in marketing and sales-related expenses, a $28.0 million decrease in allocated facilities and other supporting overhead expenses due to a decrease in overall total expenses, a $27.4 million decrease in restructuring expenses, and a $15.0 million decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets.\n2016 Compared to 2015. In 2016, sales and marketing expenses increased by $86.3 million compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to a $31.9 million increase in allocated facilities and other supporting overhead expenses due to the increase in support functions, a $27.6 million increase in restructuring expenses mainly driven by a reduction in workforce at the end of 2016, a $21.8 million increase in personnel-related costs, mainly driven by an increase in compensation expense, and a $16.5 million increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets, offset by an $11.5 million decrease in marketing and sales-related expenses.\nWe continue to evaluate key areas in our business to ensure we have the right level of sales and marketing to execute on our key priorities and objectives. We expect that both sales and marketing headcount and costs in absolute dollars will increase in the near term but will vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, for our executive, finance, legal, information technology, human resources and other administrative employees. In addition, general and administrative expenses include fees and costs for professional services, including consulting, third-party legal and accounting services and facilities and other supporting overhead costs that are not allocated to other departments.\nTable 200: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2016 to 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015 to 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 283,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 293,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 260,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 Compared to 2016.

The decreases were offset by a $9.0 million increase in fees and costs for professional services, and a $0.5 million increase in other expenses.\n2016 Compared to 2015. In 2016, general and administrative expense increased by $32.6 million compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to a $17.1 million increase in personnel-related costs, driven by an increase in compensation expense from an increase in average employee headcount, a $6.8 million increase in facilities and supporting costs not allocated to other functions, a $6.5 million increase in fees and costs for professional services, and a $5.6 million increase in restructuring expenses. The increases were offset by a $3.4 million increase in the capitalization of costs associated with developing software for internal use.\nWe plan to continue to invest in key areas of our business and ensure that we have the right level of general and administrative support on our key priorities and objectives. We expect that general and administrative expenses will vary in the near term from period to period as a percentage of revenue.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest expense incurred in connection with the $935.0 million principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes due 2019, or the 2019 Notes, and $954.0 million principal amount of 1.00% convertible senior notes due 2021, or the 2021 Notes and together with the 2019 Notes, the Notes, and interest expense related to capital leases and other financing facilities.\nTable 201: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 105,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 99,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 98,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 Compared to 2016. In 2017, interest expense increased by $5.3 million compared to 2016. Interest expense in 2017 was comprised of $99.6 million of total interest expense related to the Notes as well as our credit facility (described below) and $5.6 million related to capital leases of equipment.\n2016 Compared to 2015. In 2016, interest expense increased by $1.8 million compared to 2015. Interest expense in 2016 was comprised of $94.5 million of total interest expense related to the Notes as well as our credit facility and $5.5 million related to capital leases of equipment.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net, consists primarily of interest income resulting from our short-term investments net of the related amortization of premium paid on such investments, and unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses due to re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies as well as realized foreign exchange gains and losses on foreign exchange transactions. We expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates.\nTable 202: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (28,921\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 26,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 Compared to 2016. In 2017, other expense, net, was $28.9 million compared to other income, net, of $26.3 million in 2016. The change was primarily attributable to the recording of an other-than-temporary impairment on a cost-method investment of $62.4 million in 2017 and less favorable foreign currency exchange impacts from foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities as well as derivative financial instruments, offset by an increase in interest income on our short term investments.\nOther expense, net, in 2017 was comprised of $62.4 million of other-than-temporary impairment on a cost-method investment, $8.8 million of foreign currency exchange net loss, and $1.0 million of other expense, offset by $43.3 million of interest and other income.\n2016 Compared to 2015. In 2016, other income, net, increased by $11.4 million compared to 2015. The increase was attributable to an increase in interest income on our short term investments and favorable foreign currency exchange impacts from foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities as well as derivative financial instruments, offset by an increase in other expenses.\nOther income, net, in 2016 was comprised of $25.3 million of interest and other income and $5.8 million of foreign currency exchange gain, offset by $4.8 million of other expenses.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes consists of federal and state income taxes in the United States and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions which are expected to fluctuate based on the pre-tax results within and outside of the United States and will also be impacted by our allocation of centrally incurred costs to foreign jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rate will also be affected by the changes in tax rates and tax regulations, the impact of tax examinations, the impact of business combinations, and changes in valuation allowance. In addition, the provision is impacted by deferred income taxes and changes in the related valuation allowance reflecting the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.\nIn December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d), was signed into law. Among other provisions, the Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result, we were required to re-measure our net deferred tax assets, which resulted in a reduction of our deferred tax assets by $352.9 million, with a corresponding decrease to the valuation allowance of the same amount. We are in the process of assessing the impact of the international tax provisions provided for in the Tax Act that would apply for calendar years 2018 onwards. We are not, however, subject to the one-time mandatory transition tax.\nTable 203: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision (benefit) for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (12,274\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 Compared to 2016. Our provision for income taxes in 2017 decreased by $3.4 million compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in the income tax benefit arising from intraperiod allocation and partial release of valuation allowance attributable to the Tax Act related to AMT tax credits.\n2016 Compared to 2015. Our provision for income taxes in 2016 changed by $28.3 million compared to a benefit of $12.3 million in 2015. The increase was primarily due to a decrease in the income tax benefit arising from acquisitions of $24.2 million, and by an increase in income tax expense in foreign jurisdictions of $4.1 million. The $24.2 million decrease in income tax benefit is related to the release of deferred tax valuation allowance resulting from acquisitions completed within the prior year. The deferred tax liabilities recorded in the prior year, as part of purchase accounting, provided an additional source of taxable income to support the realizability of pre-existing deferred tax assets. In the year ended December 31, 2016, the acquisitions we completed did not result in a release of deferred tax valuation allowance due to acquisitions either in a foreign jurisdiction with no valuation allowance or offsetting acquired deferred tax assets.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $3.43 billion of federal and $1.47 billion of state net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income. These net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire for federal income tax purposes and state income tax purposes in 2027 and 2018, respectively. We also have research credit carryforwards of $259.6 million and $208.6 million for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. The federal research credit carryforward will begin to expire in 2027. The state research credit carryforward has no expiration date. Additionally, we have California Enterprise Zone credit carryforwards of $19.1 million which will begin to expire in 2023. Utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards and research credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state provisions. Any annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and research credits before utilization.\nUpon adoption of the stock-based compensation expense simplification rule including the income tax consequences; and the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets resulting from the enactment of the Tax Act, as of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $782.3 million of federal and $222.8 million of state net deferred tax assets. Concurrently, we set up a valuation allowance against all but $2.0 million of these deferred tax assets. As of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 we completed our reassessment of the realizability of these assets and have concluded that a valuation allowance is still required.\nEvaluating the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets often requires significant judgment and extensive analysis of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not (a probability level of more than 50%) that these assets will be realized. In completing this assessment management must consider both objective and subjective factors in its assessment. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n \u2022 Future reversal of existing temporary differences \n \u2022 Tax-planning strategies \n \u2022 Future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and loss carryforwards \nAs we continue to make significant strides in optimizing operations resulting in improved financial results, our future reassessment is likely to result in the determination that a valuation allowance is no longer required. This would result in such future financial reporting period in a significant reversal of the valuation allowance and a corresponding material non-cash income tax benefit and the recording of additional deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. Based on recent earnings in certain jurisdictions, sufficient positive evidence may exist within the 2018 calendar year such that we may release a significant portion of our valuation allowance.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our unaudited consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2017. The unaudited quarterly statement of operations data set forth below have been prepared on a basis consistent with our audited annual consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and include, in our opinion, all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the financial information contained in those statements. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in the future.
