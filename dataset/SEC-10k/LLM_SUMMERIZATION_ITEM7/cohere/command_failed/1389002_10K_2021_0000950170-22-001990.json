Our platform is an analytics, workflow and optimization solution for marketing professionals, enabling them to effectively manage their digital advertising spend. We market and sell our solutions to advertisers directly and through leading advertising agencies, and our customers collectively manage billions of dollars in advertising spend on our platform globally across a wide range of industries. We believe this makes us one of the largest providers of independent advertising cloud solutions. Our software solution is designed to help our customers:\n\u2022measure the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns through our proprietary reporting and analytics capabilities;\n\u2022manage and execute campaigns through our intuitive user interface and underlying technology that streamlines and automates key functions, such as advertisement creation and bidding, across multiple publishers and channels; and\n\u2022optimize campaigns across multiple publishers and channels based on market and business data to achieve desired revenue outcomes using our predictive bid management technology.\nOur current product lineup consists of MarinOne and our two legacy products, Marin Search and Marin Social. We have migrated all of our customers to use MarinOne as their primary experience when logging in. We will continue to allow access to Marin Search through at least the end of Q1 2022 to ensure a smooth transition for our customers.\n\u2022MarinOne. Our next-generation solution brings search, social and eCommerce advertising into a single-platform that helps advertisers maximize a customer journey that spans Google, Facebook, and Amazon by combining the power of Marin Search and Marin Social with newer channels like LinkedIn, Apple Search Ads, Instacart, Criteo, and YouTube.\n\u2022Marin Search. Our original solution for large advertisers and agencies, Marin Search is designed to provide search advertisers with the power, scale and flexibility required to manage large-scale advertising campaigns.\n\u2022Marin Social. Helps advertisers manage their Facebook, Instagram and Twitter advertising spend at scale.\nAdvertisers use our platform to create, target and convert precise audiences based on recent buying signals from users' search, social and eCommerce interactions. Our platform is integrated with leading publishers such as Amazon, Apple, Baidu, Bing, Criteo, Facebook, Google, Instacart, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, Yahoo!, Yahoo! Japan and Yandex. Additionally, we have integrations with dozens of leading web analytics and advertisement-serving solutions and key enterprise applications, enabling our customers to more accurately measure the return on investment of their marketing programs.\nOur software platform serves as an integration point for advertising performance, sales and revenue data, allowing advertisers to connect the dots between advertising spend and revenue outcomes. Through an intuitive interface, we enable our customers to simultaneously run large-scale digital advertising campaigns across multiple publishers and channels, making it easy for marketers to create, publish, modify and optimize campaigns.\nOur predictive bid management and optimization technology also allows advertisers to forecast outcomes and optimize campaigns across multiple publishers and channels to achieve their business goals. Our optimization technology can help advertisers\nincrease advertisement spend on those campaigns, publishers and channels that are performing well while reducing investment in those that are not. This category of solutions, which we refer to as cross-channel bid and campaign optimization, helps businesses intelligently and efficiently measure, manage, and optimize their digital advertising spend to achieve desired business results.\t\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have an adverse impact on many of our customers and their businesses and their spending on digital advertising and has had an adverse impact on our recent results of operations and may continue to affect our future results of operations. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including containment of COVID-19, effects of new variants, the availability, deployment and efficacy of vaccines, the transition from COVID-19 from being a pandemic to an endemic illness, impact on our customers and our sales cycles, and impact on our employees, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. At this time, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our financial condition or results of operations is uncertain. Since mid-March 2020, some of our customers have reduced the amount of digital advertising spend that they manage using our product which has had an adverse effect on our results of operations and some of our customers have requested extended payment terms, reduced fees or fee waivers, early contract terminations and other forms of contract relief. Also, since mid-March 2020 most of our employees have not been able to work from our offices and have been working from home, which could cause some disruptions or delays in our business activities, including our product development efforts.\nUnder the provisions of the extension of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act\u201d), we are eligible for a refundable employee retention credit subject to certain criteria. We recognized employee retention credits of $1.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, which was recorded in cost of revenues and operating expenses.\nDuring the third quarter of 2020, we commenced the implementation of a restructuring and reduction-in-force plan to reduce our operating costs and address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic ( 2020 Restructuring Plan\u201d). The 2020 Restructuring Plan included the reduction of our global workforce by approximately 60 employees, approximately half of which were located outside of the United States. The planned workforce reductions were substantially completed during 2020.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenues, Net\nWe generate revenues principally from subscription contracts under which we provide advertisers with access to our search, social and eCommerce advertising management platform, either directly or through the advertiser's relationship with an agency with whom we have a contract. Our subscription contracts are generally one year or less in length. Under subscription contracts with most of our direct advertisers and some independent agencies, we generally charge fees based on the amount of advertising spend that these customers manage through our platform or a contractual minimum monthly platform fee, whichever is greater. Certain of these customers are charged only a fixed monthly platform fee. Most of our subscription contracts with our network agency customers do not include a committed minimum monthly platform fee, and we charge fees based upon the amount of advertising spend that these customers manage through our platform. Due to the nature of the platform and the services performed under the subscription agreements, revenues are typically recognized in the amount billable to the advertiser.\nOur long-term strategic agreements have historically included multiple-year terms and are invoiced quarterly. Our largest agreement with Google was entered into in December 2018 with an effective date of October 1, 2018 (the Original Google Revenue Share Agreement\u201d) and included both a fixed baseline amount and a variable portion based on a percentage of relevant advertising search spend above the baseline threshold that runs through our technology platform. The Original Google Revenue Share Agreement had a three-year term; however, until March 2020, when we and Google executed the first amendment to the original agreement (the First Amendment\u201d), Google could terminate the Original Google Revenue Share Agreement after two years, with no penalty if we did not meet certain financial metrics. Accordingly, we accounted for the Original Google Revenue Share Agreement as a two-year agreement with one optional renewal year. The First Amendment removed the previous right of Google to terminate the Original Google Revenue Share Agreement after two years if we did not meet certain financial metrics and the Original Google Revenue Share Agreement continued for the third year until September 30, 2021. The revenue impact of the third year is being accounted for prospectively from the date of the First Amendment. The Original Google Revenue Share Agreement terminated on September 30, 2021. In September 2021, we entered into a New revenue share agreement with Google, with an effective date of October 1, 2021 (the \"New Google Revenue Share Agreement\") for a three-year term continuing until September 30, 2024. Under this New Google Revenue Share Agreement, we are eligible to receive fixed and variable revenue share payments based on a percentage of the search advertising spend that is managed through our platform. Our other long-term strategic agreements are generally variable in nature, based on a percentage of relevant search advertising spend that runs through our technology platform.\nThe majority of our revenues are derived from advertisers based in the United States. Advertisers from outside of the United States represented 23% and 25% of total revenues for 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Google Revenue Share Agreement accounted for approximately 35% of our revenues in 2021 and approximately 31% in 2020.\nRefer to Note 3 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our revenue recognition considerations.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues primarily includes personnel costs, consisting of salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation expense for employees associated with our cloud infrastructure and global services for implementation and ongoing customer service. Other costs of revenues include fees paid to contractors who supplement our support and data center personnel, expenses related to third-party data centers, depreciation of data center equipment, amortization of internally developed software, amortization of intangible assets and allocated overhead. Incremental cost of revenues associated with our long-term strategic agreements, including our largest agreement with Google, are generally not significant.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation expense and bonuses, as well as sales commissions and other costs including travel and entertainment, marketing and promotional events, lead generation activities, public relations, marketing activities, professional fees, amortization of intangible assets and allocated overhead. All of these costs are expensed as incurred, except sales commissions and the related payroll taxes, which are capitalized and amortized over the expected period of benefit in accordance with the relevant authoritative accounting guidance (refer to Note 3 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements). Our commission plans provide that commission payments to our sales representatives are paid based on the key components of the applicable customer contract, including the minimum or fixed monthly platform fee during the initial contract term.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our product development and engineering employees and executives, including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation expense and bonuses. Also included are non-personnel costs such as professional fees payable to third-party development resources, amortization of intangible assets and allocated overhead.\nOur research and development efforts are focused on enhancing our software architecture, adding new features and functionality to our platform and improving the efficiency with which we deliver these services to our customers, including the development of MarinOne.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation expense and bonuses for our administrative, legal, human resources, finance and accounting employees and executives. Also included are non-personnel costs, such as audit fees, tax services and legal fees, as well as professional fees, insurance and other corporate expenses, including allocated overhead.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net, primarily consists of sublease income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses, as well as interest income earned on our cash equivalents offset by the interest expense related to our outstanding note payable and finance lease liabilities.\nIncome Tax Benefit, Net\nThe benefit from income taxes consists of federal, state and foreign income taxes. Due to recent losses, we maintain a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2021. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, in assessing the extent to which a valuation allowance should be applied against our deferred tax assets.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table is a summary of our consolidated statements of operations for the specified periods and results of operations as a percentage of revenues for those periods. The period-to-period comparisons of results are not necessarily indicative of results for future periods. Percentage of revenues figures are rounded and therefore may not subtotal exactly.\nA discussion regarding our consolidated statements of operations and results of operations as a percentage of revenue for 2021 compared to 2020 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for 2020 compared to 2019 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,

GAAP. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss, adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, depreciation, the amortization of internally developed software, intangible assets, the capitalization of internally developed software, the impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, interest expense, net, the benefit from or provision for income taxes, CARES Act employee retention credits, other income or expenses, net, the non-recurring costs or gains associated with acquisitions, divestitures and restructurings, and certain professional fees that we have incurred in responding to third-party subpoenas that we have received related to governmental investigations of Google and Facebook. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net loss, operating loss or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We prepare Adjusted EBITDA to eliminate the impact of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance. Investors are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the following reasons:\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items such as stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, capitalized software development costs, interest expense, net, benefit from or provision for income taxes, other income or expenses, net and costs or gains associated with acquisitions, divestitures and restructurings, that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing, capital structures and the method by which assets were acquired;\n\u2022Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with GAAP financial measures for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of operating performance and the effectiveness of our business strategies and in communications with our Board of Directors concerning our financial performance; and\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA provides consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations and also facilitates comparisons with other peer companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results.\nWe understand that although Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, it has limitations as an analytical tool, and investors should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported under GAAP. These limitations include:\n\u2022Depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, and the assets being depreciated or amortized will often have to be replaced in the future; however, Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for these replacements;\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs or contractual commitments;\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements for income taxes and the cash impact of other income or expense; and\n\u2022Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net loss, the most comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated:\nTable 10: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12,944\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(14,051\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Amortization of internally developed software\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Benefit from income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(134\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(711\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>CARES Act employee retention credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,610\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Capitalization of internally developed software costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,377\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,869\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Restructuring related expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(984\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,533\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Third-party subpoena-related expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11,148\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,491\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nRevenues, Net\nTable 11: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenues, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,563\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues, net in 2021 decreased by $5.6 million, or 19%, as compared to 2020.

The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in the number of global services and cloud infrastructure personnel, which led to a decrease of $1.7 million in compensation and benefits expense, including stock-based compensation expense, as compared to 2020. This reduction in headcount also contributed to a decrease in allocated facilities and information technology costs of $0.4 million in 2021. We experienced a decrease of $0.8 million in hosting costs in 2021 due to a decline in usage of our hosting platform. Additionally, amortization of internally developed software costs decreased by $0.6 million, due primarily to the timing of the capitalization of certain internal projects as compared to 2020. There was also a decrease of $0.7 million in depreciation.\nWe expect cost of revenues to remain flat or increase slightly in the near term in absolute dollars as we should see savings in colocation expenses but may increase personnel costs.\nOur gross margin increased to 47% during 2021, as compared to 40% during 2020.

Additionally there was a decrease of $0.3 million in equipment and professional fees.

From incorporation until our initial public offering, or the IPO, we raised $105.7 million, net of related issuance costs, in funding through private placements of our preferred stock. In March and April 2013, we raised net proceeds of $109.3 million in our IPO. In 2021 and 2020 we raised total net proceeds of $41.6 million and $7.5 million, respectively from at-the-market securities offering programs, and in 2020 we received proceeds of $3.3 million from a loan through the Paycheck Protection Program. An aggregate principal amount of $3.1 million of this loan was forgiven in January 2022 and we repaid the remaining outstanding balance of $0.2 million in February 2022. From time to time, we have also utilized equipment lines and entered into finance lease arrangements to fund capital purchases. As of December 31, 2021, our principal source of liquidity was our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $46.8 million. Our primary operating cash requirements include the payment of compensation and other employee-related expenses, as well as costs for our facilities and information technology infrastructure.\nWe maintain a $0.2 million irrevocable letter of credit to secure the non-cancelable lease for our corporate headquarters in San Francisco which is reflected as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nWe maintain cash balances in our foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2021, we had $46.8 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents in aggregate, of which $1.1 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA, which instituted fundamental changes to the taxation of multinational corporations. Among these changes is a mandatory one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of the accumulated earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries, and a tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries in excess of a specified return on the subsidiaries' tangible assets, known as the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, or GILTI. We also determined that no GILTI inclusion would be required in 2019 or 2020 as our foreign subsidiaries have accumulated significant losses. If funds held by our foreign subsidiaries were needed for our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue U.S. tax liabilities associated with the repatriation of these funds. However, given the amount of our net operating loss carryovers in the United States, such repatriation will most likely not result in material U.S. cash tax payments within the next year. Additionally, we do not believe that foreign withholding taxes associated with repatriating these funds would be material.\nOn March 14, 2019, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which was declared effective by the SEC on May 10, 2019, under which we could offer our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, subscription rights and units having an aggregate offering price of up to $50.0 million. As part of the shelf registration statement, we entered into an equity distribution agreement with JMP Securities LLC under which we could offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $13.0 million through an at-the-market offering program administered by JMP Securities. We were not required to sell any of our stock under this program. JMP Securities was entitled to compensation of up to 5.0% of the gross proceeds from sales of our common stock pursuant to the equity distribution agreement. We intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of securities under the equity distribution agreement primarily for working capital and general corporate purposes. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold 2.7 million shares of our common stock under this equity distribution agreement, and received proceeds of $7.5 million, net of offering costs of $0.5 million, at a weighted average sales price of $2.92 per share. During February 2021 we sold an additional 1.2 million shares of our common stock under this equity distribution agreement and received proceeds of $3.0 million, net of offering costs of $0.2 million, at a weighted average sales price of $2.68 per share. There are currently no additional amounts available to be sold under this equity distribution agreement. On July 15, 2021, we entered into a new equity distribution agreement with JMP Securities under which we could sell shares of our common stock up to an aggregate gross sales price of $40.0 million through a new at-the-market securities offering program. In July 2021, we sold 4.3 million shares of our common stock under this July\n2021 equity distribution agreement and received proceeds of $38.8 million, net of offering costs of $1.2 million, at a weighted average sales price of $9.27 per share, which exhausted all securities available for sale under this July 2021 equity distribution agreement.\nIn May 2020, we entered into a loan agreement with a lender for the loan in an aggregate principal amount of $3.3 million (the Loan\u201d) pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the PPP\u201d) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. We received the Loan proceeds on May 12, 2020. An aggregate principal amount of $3.1 million of the Loan was forgiven in January 2022 and we repaid the remaining outstanding balance of $0.2 million in February 2022. See Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this loan.\nWe have incurred significant losses in each fiscal year since our incorporation in 2006, and we expect to continue to incur losses and negative cash flows in the future.\nOn August 3, 2021, we filed a new shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which was declared effective by the SEC on August 19, 2021 and provides that we may offer our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, subscription rights and units having an aggregate offering price of up to $100.0 million. As part of this new 2021 registration statement, we entered into a third equity distribution agreement with JMP Securities and established a new $50.0 million at-the-market\u201d securities offering facility, pursuant to which we may be able to issue and sell shares of our common stock. We have not yet sold any shares under this August 2021 equity distribution agreement and no assurances can be provided as to if or when me may be able to sell any shares or the terms of any such sales. In accordance with the SEC's Instruction I.B.6 of Registration Statement on Form S-3, we are adjusting the maximum aggregate market value of the securities that may be sold pursuant to this current \"at-the-market\" securities offering facility from $50.0 million to approximately $22.8 million based on our estimated market capitalization on the date we file this Annual Report until such time when we are eligible to conduct such offering in accordance with Instruction I.B.1 of the Registration Statement on Form S-3.\nSummary of Cash Flows\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,942\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,675\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,296\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,884\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net increase in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nCash used in operating activities is primarily influenced by the amount of cash we invest in personnel and infrastructure to support the operation of our business and the fluctuations in the number of advertisers using our platform. Cash used in operating activities has typically been affected by net losses and further increased by changes in our operating assets and liabilities, particularly in the areas of accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities, adjusted for non-cash expense items such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense and deferred income tax benefits.\nCash used in operating activities in 2021 of $7.9 million was primarily the result of a net loss of $12.9 million, which was partially offset by non-cash expenses of $4.9 million, primarily consisting of depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, provision for bad debts and net changes in operating leases, and a $0.1 million net change in working capital items. These items consisted most notably of (1) a decrease in accounts receivable of $0.6 million due to the decrease in revenues and the timing of related collections and (2) a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities (both current and non-current) of $0.9 million due to the timing of related disbursements and lower accrued payroll-related costs driven by lower headcount.\nCash used in operating activities in 2020 of $5.7 million was primarily the result of a net loss of $14.1 million, which was partially offset by non-cash expenses of $6.8 million, primarily consisting of depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, provision for bad debts and net changes in operating leases, and a $1.6 million net change in working capital items. These items consisted most notably of (1) a decrease in accounts receivable of $4.1 million due to the decrease in revenues and the timing of\nrelated collections and (2) a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities (both current and non-current) of $2.5 million due to the timing of related disbursements and lower accrued payroll-related costs driven by lower headcount.\nInvesting Activities\nIn 2021 and 2020, investing activities primarily consisted of $1.3 million and $1.9 million of capitalized internally developed software costs. Capital expenditures may vary from period-to-period due to the timing of our operational requirements and the development cycles of our internally-developed hosted software platform. We expect to continue to invest in the development of our software platform for the foreseeable future.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities in 2021 was $41.5 million. This primarily consisted of $41.9 million of net cash proceeds from the issuance of common shares pursuant to our equity distribution agreements with JMP Securities, partially offset by $0.4 million in employee taxes paid for withheld shares upon the settlement of equity awards.\nCash provided by financing activities in 2020 was $10.2 million. This primarily consisted of $7.7 million of net cash proceeds from the issuance of common shares pursuant to our equity distribution agreement with JMP Securities and $3.3 million net proceeds from our Loan pursuant to the PPP under the CARES Act, partially offset by $0.6 million of net repayments under our right-of-use finance lease liabilities and $0.2 million in employee taxes paid for withheld shares upon the settlement of equity awards.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nOur principal commitments consist of operating leases for office space, net of sublease income. As of December 31, 2021, the future minimum payments under these commitments, were as follows:\nTable 24: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due By Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Within 1\nYear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Note payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating leases obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Sublease income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(616\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(616\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding, which specify significant terms including payment terms, related services and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table.\nThe note payable relates to our loan pursuant to the PPP under the CARES Act. An aggregate principal amount of $3.1 million of the Loan was forgiven in January 2022 and we repaid the remaining outstanding balance of $0.2 million in February 2022. See Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this loan.\nDuring the ordinary course of business, we include indemnification provisions within certain of our contracts. Pursuant to these arrangements, we may be obligated to indemnify, hold harmless and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally parties with which we have commercial relations, in connection with certain intellectual property infringement claims by any third party with respect to our software. To date, there have not been any costs incurred in connection with such indemnification arrangements and therefore, there is no accrual for such amounts as of December 31, 2021.\nIn addition to the obligations in the table above, we have approximately $1.1 million of uncertain tax positions that have been recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2021. It is uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuring the periods presented, we did not have, nor do we currently have, any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We are therefore not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships.\nWe have no obligations that meet the definition of an off-balance sheet arrangement as of December 31, 2021, other than operating leases and related subleases, as described in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements, and the irrevocable letter of credit described above.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that can have a significant impact on the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. These items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future.\nOur estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. If actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates, our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected. See Risk Factors\u201d for certain matters that may affect these estimates or our future financial condition or results of operations. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if the changes in estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the financial statements.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we believe that the accounting policies discussed below involve the greatest degree of complexity and exercise of judgment by our management. The methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations and, accordingly, we believe the policies described below are the most critical for understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenues principally from subscriptions either directly with advertisers or with advertising agencies to our platform for the management of search, social and eCommerce advertising. Revenue is recognized when control of these advertising management services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.\nOur subscription contracts provide advertisers with access to our advertising management platform. Advertisers do not have the right to take possession of the software supporting the services at any time. These contracts are generally one year or less in length. The subscription fee under most contracts consists of the greater of a minimum monthly platform fee or variable consideration based on the volume of advertising spend managed through our platform at the contractual percentage of spend.\nOur subscription services comprise a single stand-ready performance obligation satisfied over time, as the advertiser simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit from our performance. This performance obligation constitutes a series of services that are substantially the same and provided over time using the same measure of progress. Revenues derived from these arrangements are recognized over time using an output method based upon the passage of time as this provides a faithful depiction of the pattern of transfer of control. Fixed minimum monthly platform fees are recognized ratably over the contract term as the single performance obligation is satisfied. Variable fees are allocated to the distinct month of the series in which they are earned because the terms of the variable payments relate specifically to the outcome from transferring the distinct time increment (month) of service and because such amounts reflect the fees to which we expect to be entitled for providing access to the advertising management platform for that period, consistent with the allocation objective of authoritative revenue recognition guidance.\nWe have also entered into long-term strategic agreements with certain leading search publishers. Under these strategic agreements, we receive consideration based on a percentage of the search advertising spend that our customers manage on our platform. These strategic agreements are generally billed on a quarterly basis and are either fixed or variable in nature, based on a percentage of relevant search advertising spend that runs through our technology platform.\nWe evaluate the total amount of variable revenue share payments expected to be earned by using the most likely method, as we believe this method represents the most appropriate estimate for this consideration, based on historical service trends, the individual contract considerations and our best judgment at the time. We include estimates of variable consideration in revenues only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the\nuncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. We expect that in the future, revenues from strategic agreements will continue to grow as a percentage of our total revenues, net.\nIncome Taxes\nSignificant assumptions, judgments and estimates are involved in determining our provision for (benefit from) income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets. Our judgments, assumptions and estimates relating to the current provision for income taxes include the geographic mix and amount of income (loss), our interpretation of current tax laws, and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Our judgments also include anticipating the tax positions we will record in the financial statements before preparing and filing the tax returns. Our estimates and assumptions may differ from the actual results as reflected in our income tax returns and we record the required adjustments when they are identified or resolved. These estimates may not be materially sensitive on an individual basis but could be material on an aggregate basis if they were to differ from current estimates. Changes in our business and tax laws or our interpretation of those, and developments in current and future tax audits, could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\nAccounts Receivable and Related Reserves\nWe record accounts receivable at the invoiced amounts, and these receivables do not bear interest. We record reserves as a reduction of our accounts receivable balance for doubtful accounts and revenue credits. Estimates are required to determine both of these reserves.\nOur allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our receivables portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available evidence. When collection of an outstanding balance is no longer probable, we will either partially or fully write-off the balance against the allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts charges are included as a component of general and administrative expenses. Our reserve for revenue credits relates to service credits that are expected to be issued to customers during the ordinary course of business. These credits typically relate to customer disputes and billing adjustments and are recorded as reductions to revenues, net. Reserves for revenue credits are accounted for as variable consideration under authoritative revenue recognition guidance and are estimated using the expected value method based on an analysis of credits issued in previous periods.

Our platform is an analytics, workflow and optimization solution for marketing professionals, enabling them to effectively manage their digital advertising spend. We market and sell our solutions to advertisers directly and through leading advertising agencies, and our customers collectively manage billions of dollars in advertising spend on our platform globally across a wide range of industries. We believe this makes us one of the largest providers of independent advertising cloud solutions. Our software solution is designed to help our customers:\n\u2022measure the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns through our proprietary reporting and analytics capabilities;\n\u2022manage and execute campaigns through our intuitive user interface and underlying technology that streamlines and automates key functions, such as advertisement creation and bidding, across multiple publishers and channels; and\n\u2022optimize campaigns across multiple publishers and channels based on market and business data to achieve desired revenue outcomes using our predictive bid management technology.\nOur current product lineup consists of MarinOne and our two legacy products, Marin Search and Marin Social. We have migrated all of our customers to use MarinOne as their primary experience when logging in. We will continue to allow access to Marin Search through at least the end of Q1 2022 to ensure a smooth transition for our customers.\n\u2022MarinOne. Our next-generation solution brings search, social and eCommerce advertising into a single-platform that helps advertisers maximize a customer journey that spans Google, Facebook, and Amazon by combining the power of Marin Search and Marin Social with newer channels like LinkedIn, Apple Search Ads, Instacart, Criteo, and YouTube.\n\u2022Marin Search. Our original solution for large advertisers and agencies, Marin Search is designed to provide search advertisers with the power, scale and flexibility required to manage large-scale advertising campaigns.\n\u2022Marin Social. Helps advertisers manage their Facebook, Instagram and Twitter advertising spend at scale.\nAdvertisers use our platform to create, target and convert precise audiences based on recent buying signals from users' search, social and eCommerce interactions. Our platform is integrated with leading publishers such as Amazon, Apple, Baidu, Bing, Criteo, Facebook, Google, Instacart, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, Yahoo!, Yahoo! Japan and Yandex. Additionally, we have integrations with dozens of leading web analytics and advertisement-serving solutions and key enterprise applications, enabling our customers to more accurately measure the return on investment of their marketing programs.\nOur software platform serves as an integration point for advertising performance, sales and revenue data, allowing advertisers to connect the dots between advertising spend and revenue outcomes. Through an intuitive interface, we enable our customers to simultaneously run large-scale digital advertising campaigns across multiple publishers and channels, making it easy for marketers to create, publish, modify and optimize campaigns.\nOur predictive bid management and optimization technology also allows advertisers to forecast outcomes and optimize campaigns across multiple publishers and channels to achieve their business goals. Our optimization technology can help advertisers\nincrease advertisement spend on those campaigns, publishers and channels that are performing well while reducing investment in those that are not. This category of solutions, which we refer to as cross-channel bid and campaign optimization, helps businesses intelligently and efficiently measure, manage, and optimize their digital advertising spend to achieve desired business results.\t\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have an adverse impact on many of our customers and their businesses and their spending on digital advertising and has had an adverse impact on our recent results of operations and may continue to affect our future results of operations. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including containment of COVID-19, effects of new variants, the availability, deployment and efficacy of vaccines, the transition from COVID-19 from being a pandemic to an endemic illness, impact on our customers and our sales cycles, and impact on our employees, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. At this time, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our financial condition or results of operations is uncertain. Since mid-March 2020, some of our customers have reduced the amount of digital advertising spend that they manage using our product which has had an adverse effect on our results of operations and some of our customers have requested extended payment terms, reduced fees or fee waivers, early contract terminations and other forms of contract relief. Also, since mid-March 2020 most of our employees have not been able to work from our offices and have been working from home, which could cause some disruptions or delays in our business activities, including our product development efforts.\nUnder the provisions of the extension of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act\u201d), we are eligible for a refundable employee retention credit subject to certain criteria. We recognized employee retention credits of $1.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, which was recorded in cost of revenues and operating expenses.\nDuring the third quarter of 2020, we commenced the implementation of a restructuring and reduction-in-force plan to reduce our operating costs and address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic ( 2020 Restructuring Plan\u201d). The 2020 Restructuring Plan included the reduction of our global workforce by approximately 60 employees, approximately half of which were located outside of the United States. The planned workforce reductions were substantially completed during 2020.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenues, Net\nWe generate revenues principally from subscription contracts under which we provide advertisers with access to our search, social and eCommerce advertising management platform, either directly or through the advertiser's relationship with an agency with whom we have a contract. Our subscription contracts are generally one year or less in length. Under subscription contracts with most of our direct advertisers and some independent agencies, we generally charge fees based on the amount of advertising spend that these customers manage through our platform or a contractual minimum monthly platform fee, whichever is greater. Certain of these customers are charged only a fixed monthly platform fee. Most of our subscription contracts with our network agency customers do not include a committed minimum monthly platform fee, and we charge fees based upon the amount of advertising spend that these customers manage through our platform. Due to the nature of the platform and the services performed under the subscription agreements, revenues are typically recognized in the amount billable to the advertiser.\nOur long-term strategic agreements have historically included multiple-year terms and are invoiced quarterly. Our largest agreement with Google was entered into in December 2018 with an effective date of October 1, 2018 (the Original Google Revenue Share Agreement\u201d) and included both a fixed baseline amount and a variable portion based on a percentage of relevant advertising search spend above the baseline threshold that runs through our technology platform. The Original Google Revenue Share Agreement had a three-year term; however, until March 2020, when we and Google executed the first amendment to the original agreement (the First Amendment\u201d), Google could terminate the Original Google Revenue Share Agreement after two years, with no penalty if we did not meet certain financial metrics. Accordingly, we accounted for the Original Google Revenue Share Agreement as a two-year agreement with one optional renewal year. The First Amendment removed the previous right of Google to terminate the Original Google Revenue Share Agreement after two years if we did not meet certain financial metrics and the Original Google Revenue Share Agreement continued for the third year until September 30, 2021. The revenue impact of the third year is being accounted for prospectively from the date of the First Amendment. The Original Google Revenue Share Agreement terminated on September 30, 2021. In September 2021, we entered into a New revenue share agreement with Google, with an effective date of October 1, 2021 (the \"New Google Revenue Share Agreement\") for a three-year term continuing until September 30, 2024. Under this New Google Revenue Share Agreement, we are eligible to receive fixed and variable revenue share payments based on a percentage of the search advertising spend that is managed through our platform. Our other long-term strategic agreements are generally variable in nature, based on a percentage of relevant search advertising spend that runs through our technology platform.\nThe majority of our revenues are derived from advertisers based in the United States. Advertisers from outside of the United States represented 23% and 25% of total revenues for 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Google Revenue Share Agreement accounted for approximately 35% of our revenues in 2021 and approximately 31% in 2020.\nRefer to Note 3 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our revenue recognition considerations.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues primarily includes personnel costs, consisting of salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation expense for employees associated with our cloud infrastructure and global services for implementation and ongoing customer service. Other costs of revenues include fees paid to contractors who supplement our support and data center personnel, expenses related to third-party data centers, depreciation of data center equipment, amortization of internally developed software, amortization of intangible assets and allocated overhead. Incremental cost of revenues associated with our long-term strategic agreements, including our largest agreement with Google, are generally not significant.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation expense and bonuses, as well as sales commissions and other costs including travel and entertainment, marketing and promotional events, lead generation activities, public relations, marketing activities, professional fees, amortization of intangible assets and allocated overhead. All of these costs are expensed as incurred, except sales commissions and the related payroll taxes, which are capitalized and amortized over the expected period of benefit in accordance with the relevant authoritative accounting guidance (refer to Note 3 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements). Our commission plans provide that commission payments to our sales representatives are paid based on the key components of the applicable customer contract, including the minimum or fixed monthly platform fee during the initial contract term.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our product development and engineering employees and executives, including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation expense and bonuses. Also included are non-personnel costs such as professional fees payable to third-party development resources, amortization of intangible assets and allocated overhead.\nOur research and development efforts are focused on enhancing our software architecture, adding new features and functionality to our platform and improving the efficiency with which we deliver these services to our customers, including the development of MarinOne.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation expense and bonuses for our administrative, legal, human resources, finance and accounting employees and executives. Also included are non-personnel costs, such as audit fees, tax services and legal fees, as well as professional fees, insurance and other corporate expenses, including allocated overhead.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net, primarily consists of sublease income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses, as well as interest income earned on our cash equivalents offset by the interest expense related to our outstanding note payable and finance lease liabilities.\nIncome Tax Benefit, Net\nThe benefit from income taxes consists of federal, state and foreign income taxes. Due to recent losses, we maintain a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2021. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, in assessing the extent to which a valuation allowance should be applied against our deferred tax assets.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table is a summary of our consolidated statements of operations for the specified periods and results of operations as a percentage of revenues for those periods. The period-to-period comparisons of results are not necessarily indicative of results for future periods. Percentage of revenues figures are rounded and therefore may not subtotal exactly.\nA discussion regarding our consolidated statements of operations and results of operations as a percentage of revenue for 2021 compared to 2020 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for 2020 compared to 2019 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on February 26, 2021, which is available free of charge on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.\n\n(1)Stock-based compensation expense included in the consolidated statements of operations data above was as follows:\n\n(2)Amortization of intangible assets included in the consolidated statements of operations data above was as follows:\n\n(3)Restructuring-related expenses included in the consolidated statements of operations data above were as follows:\n\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated revenues by geographic area, as well as the related percentages of total revenues, for the specified periods.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a financial measure not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss, adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, depreciation, the amortization of internally developed software, intangible assets, the capitalization of internally developed software, the impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, interest expense, net, the benefit from or provision for income taxes, CARES Act employee retention credits, other income or expenses, net, the non-recurring costs or gains associated with acquisitions, divestitures and restructurings, and certain professional fees that we have incurred in responding to third-party subpoenas that we have received related to governmental investigations of Google and Facebook. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net loss, operating loss or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We prepare Adjusted EBITDA to eliminate the impact of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance. Investors are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the following reasons:\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items such as stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, capitalized software development costs, interest expense, net, benefit from or provision for income taxes, other income or expenses, net and costs or gains associated with acquisitions, divestitures and restructurings, that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing, capital structures and the method by which assets were acquired;\n\u2022Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with GAAP financial measures for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of operating performance and the effectiveness of our business strategies and in communications with our Board of Directors concerning our financial performance; and\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA provides consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations and also facilitates comparisons with other peer companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results.\nWe understand that although Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, it has limitations as an analytical tool, and investors should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported under GAAP. These limitations include:\n\u2022Depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, and the assets being depreciated or amortized will often have to be replaced in the future; however, Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for these replacements;\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs or contractual commitments;\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements for income taxes and the cash impact of other income or expense; and\n\u2022Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net loss, the most comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated:\n\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nRevenues, Net\n\nRevenues, net in 2021 decreased by $5.6 million, or 19%, as compared to 2020. During 2021, we experienced ongoing customer turnover that was only partially offset by new customer bookings. Since mid-March 2020, some of our customers have reduced the amount of digital advertising spend that they manage using our product due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Revenues, net in 2021 and 2020 are inclusive of $8.6 million and $9.1 million, respectively, from the Google Revenue Share Agreement, as described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.\nRevenues, net from our customers located in the United States represented 77% and 75% of total revenues, net for 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Google Revenue Share Agreement accounted for 35% and 31% of total revenues, net for 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nCost of Revenues and Gross Margin\n\nCost of revenues in 2021 decreased by $5.0 million, or 28%, as compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in the number of global services and cloud infrastructure personnel, which led to a decrease of $1.7 million in compensation and benefits expense, including stock-based compensation expense, as compared to 2020. This reduction in headcount also contributed to a decrease in allocated facilities and information technology costs of $0.4 million in 2021. We experienced a decrease of $0.8 million in hosting costs in 2021 due to a decline in usage of our hosting platform. Additionally, amortization of internally developed software costs decreased by $0.6 million, due primarily to the timing of the capitalization of certain internal projects as compared to 2020. There was also a decrease of $0.7 million in depreciation.\nWe expect cost of revenues to remain flat or increase slightly in the near term in absolute dollars as we should see savings in colocation expenses but may increase personnel costs.\nOur gross margin increased to 47% during 2021, as compared to 40% during 2020. This was primarily due to our costs declining at a faster rate than the corresponding decrease in revenues, net.\nSales and Marketing\n\nSales and marketing expenses in 2021 decreased by $1.5 million, or 21%, as compared to 2020. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the global sales support and marketing headcount, including reductions that were part of our restructuring activities during 2020, contributing to net decreases of $0.7 million in personnel-related costs, and $0.3 million in allocated facilities and information technology costs as compared to 2020. Additionally, our commissions decreased $0.4 million.\nWe expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in the near term in absolute dollars as we add to sales team and increase marketing investment.\nResearch and Development\n\nResearch and development expenses in 2021 decreased by $2.0 million, or 16%, as compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the number of full-time research and development personnel, resulting in a decrease of $1.7 million in compensation expense and $0.4 million in allocated facilities and information technology costs as compared to 2020. Additionally there was a decrease of $0.3 million in equipment and professional fees. The decreases were partially offset by an increase of approximately $0.8 million for capitalization of salary expense related to internally developed software.\nWe expect research and development expenses to remain flat or increase slightly in the near term as we increase investment in research and development.\nGeneral and Administrative\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2021 increased by $0.8 million, or 9%, as compared to 2020. This was primarily due to an increase $1.0 million in facilities and IT overhead allocation due to headcount increases and $0.5 million in professional fees that we have incurred in responding to third-party subpoenas that we have received related to governmental investigations of Google and Facebook. This was offset by a decrease of $0.7 million in facilities expense in 2021, primarily due to a reduction in headcount.\nWe expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in the near term in absolute dollars due to higher professional costs.\nOther Income, Net\n\nOther income, net, primarily consists of sublease income as well as foreign currency transaction gains and losses and interest income and expense. In 2021, we generated sublease income of $1.1 million, as compared to $1.7 million in 2020.\nIncome tax benefit, net\n\nThe benefit from income taxes in 2021 totaled $0.1 million, as compared to a benefit from income taxes of $0.7 million in 2020. The primary reason for this decrease was the current foreign income tax provision which was driven by changes to the reserve for uncertain tax positions.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2021. We have prepared the quarterly data on a basis consistent with our audited annual financial statements, including, in the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair statement of the financial information contained in these statements. The historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n(1)Stock-based compensation expense included in the consolidated statements of operations data above was as follows:\n\n(2)Amortization of intangible assets included in the consolidated statements of operations data above was as follows:\n\n(3)Restructuring-related expenses included in the consolidated statements of operations data above were as follows:\n\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the specified periods as a percentage of our revenues for those periods. Percentage of revenue figures are rounded and therefore may not subtotal exactly.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our incorporation in March 2006, we have relied primarily on sales of our capital stock to fund our operating activities. From incorporation until our initial public offering, or the IPO, we raised $105.7 million, net of related issuance costs, in funding through private placements of our preferred stock. In March and April 2013, we raised net proceeds of $109.3 million in our IPO. In 2021 and 2020 we raised total net proceeds of $41.6 million and $7.5 million, respectively from at-the-market securities offering programs, and in 2020 we received proceeds of $3.3 million from a loan through the Paycheck Protection Program. An aggregate principal amount of $3.1 million of this loan was forgiven in January 2022 and we repaid the remaining outstanding balance of $0.2 million in February 2022. From time to time, we have also utilized equipment lines and entered into finance lease arrangements to fund capital purchases. As of December 31, 2021, our principal source of liquidity was our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $46.8 million. Our primary operating cash requirements include the payment of compensation and other employee-related expenses, as well as costs for our facilities and information technology infrastructure.\nWe maintain a $0.2 million irrevocable letter of credit to secure the non-cancelable lease for our corporate headquarters in San Francisco which is reflected as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nWe maintain cash balances in our foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2021, we had $46.8 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents in aggregate, of which $1.1 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA, which instituted fundamental changes to the taxation of multinational corporations. Among these changes is a mandatory one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of the accumulated earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries, and a tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries in excess of a specified return on the subsidiaries' tangible assets, known as the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, or GILTI. We also determined that no GILTI inclusion would be required in 2019 or 2020 as our foreign subsidiaries have accumulated significant losses. If funds held by our foreign subsidiaries were needed for our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue U.S. tax liabilities associated with the repatriation of these funds. However, given the amount of our net operating loss carryovers in the United States, such repatriation will most likely not result in material U.S. cash tax payments within the next year. Additionally, we do not believe that foreign withholding taxes associated with repatriating these funds would be material.\nOn March 14, 2019, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which was declared effective by the SEC on May 10, 2019, under which we could offer our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, subscription rights and units having an aggregate offering price of up to $50.0 million. As part of the shelf registration statement, we entered into an equity distribution agreement with JMP Securities LLC under which we could offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $13.0 million through an at-the-market offering program administered by JMP Securities. We were not required to sell any of our stock under this program. JMP Securities was entitled to compensation of up to 5.0% of the gross proceeds from sales of our common stock pursuant to the equity distribution agreement. We intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of securities under the equity distribution agreement primarily for working capital and general corporate purposes. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold 2.7 million shares of our common stock under this equity distribution agreement, and received proceeds of $7.5 million, net of offering costs of $0.5 million, at a weighted average sales price of $2.92 per share. During February 2021 we sold an additional 1.2 million shares of our common stock under this equity distribution agreement and received proceeds of $3.0 million, net of offering costs of $0.2 million, at a weighted average sales price of $2.68 per share. There are currently no additional amounts available to be sold under this equity distribution agreement. On July 15, 2021, we entered into a new equity distribution agreement with JMP Securities under which we could sell shares of our common stock up to an aggregate gross sales price of $40.0 million through a new at-the-market securities offering program. In July 2021, we sold 4.3 million shares of our common stock under this July\n2021 equity distribution agreement and received proceeds of $38.8 million, net of offering costs of $1.2 million, at a weighted average sales price of $9.27 per share, which exhausted all securities available for sale under this July 2021 equity distribution agreement.\nIn May 2020, we entered into a loan agreement with a lender for the loan in an aggregate principal amount of $3.3 million (the Loan\u201d) pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the PPP\u201d) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. We received the Loan proceeds on May 12, 2020. An aggregate principal amount of $3.1 million of the Loan was forgiven in January 2022 and we repaid the remaining outstanding balance of $0.2 million in February 2022. See Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this loan.\nWe have incurred significant losses in each fiscal year since our incorporation in 2006, and we expect to continue to incur losses and negative cash flows in the future.\nOn August 3, 2021, we filed a new shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which was declared effective by the SEC on August 19, 2021 and provides that we may offer our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, subscription rights and units having an aggregate offering price of up to $100.0 million. As part of this new 2021 registration statement, we entered into a third equity distribution agreement with JMP Securities and established a new $50.0 million at-the-market\u201d securities offering facility, pursuant to which we may be able to issue and sell shares of our common stock. We have not yet sold any shares under this August 2021 equity distribution agreement and no assurances can be provided as to if or when me may be able to sell any shares or the terms of any such sales. In accordance with the SEC's Instruction I.B.6 of Registration Statement on Form S-3, we are adjusting the maximum aggregate market value of the securities that may be sold pursuant to this current \"at-the-market\" securities offering facility from $50.0 million to approximately $22.8 million based on our estimated market capitalization on the date we file this Annual Report until such time when we are eligible to conduct such offering in accordance with Instruction I.B.1 of the Registration Statement on Form S-3.\nSummary of Cash Flows\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated:\n\nOperating Activities\nCash used in operating activities is primarily influenced by the amount of cash we invest in personnel and infrastructure to support the operation of our business and the fluctuations in the number of advertisers using our platform. Cash used in operating activities has typically been affected by net losses and further increased by changes in our operating assets and liabilities, particularly in the areas of accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities, adjusted for non-cash expense items such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense and deferred income tax benefits.\nCash used in operating activities in 2021 of $7.9 million was primarily the result of a net loss of $12.9 million, which was partially offset by non-cash expenses of $4.9 million, primarily consisting of depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, provision for bad debts and net changes in operating leases, and a $0.1 million net change in working capital items. These items consisted most notably of (1) a decrease in accounts receivable of $0.6 million due to the decrease in revenues and the timing of related collections and (2) a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities (both current and non-current) of $0.9 million due to the timing of related disbursements and lower accrued payroll-related costs driven by lower headcount.\nCash used in operating activities in 2020 of $5.7 million was primarily the result of a net loss of $14.1 million, which was partially offset by non-cash expenses of $6.8 million, primarily consisting of depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, provision for bad debts and net changes in operating leases, and a $1.6 million net change in working capital items. These items consisted most notably of (1) a decrease in accounts receivable of $4.1 million due to the decrease in revenues and the timing of\nrelated collections and (2) a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities (both current and non-current) of $2.5 million due to the timing of related disbursements and lower accrued payroll-related costs driven by lower headcount.\nInvesting Activities\nIn 2021 and 2020, investing activities primarily consisted of $1.3 million and $1.9 million of capitalized internally developed software costs. Capital expenditures may vary from period-to-period due to the timing of our operational requirements and the development cycles of our internally-developed hosted software platform. We expect to continue to invest in the development of our software platform for the foreseeable future.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities in 2021 was $41.5 million. This primarily consisted of $41.9 million of net cash proceeds from the issuance of common shares pursuant to our equity distribution agreements with JMP Securities, partially offset by $0.4 million in employee taxes paid for withheld shares upon the settlement of equity awards.\nCash provided by financing activities in 2020 was $10.2 million. This primarily consisted of $7.7 million of net cash proceeds from the issuance of common shares pursuant to our equity distribution agreement with JMP Securities and $3.3 million net proceeds from our Loan pursuant to the PPP under the CARES Act, partially offset by $0.6 million of net repayments under our right-of-use finance lease liabilities and $0.2 million in employee taxes paid for withheld shares upon the settlement of equity awards.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nOur principal commitments consist of operating leases for office space, net of sublease income. As of December 31, 2021, the future minimum payments under these commitments, were as follows:\n ", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.

Our platform is an analytics, workflow and optimization solution for marketing professionals, enabling them to effectively manage their digital advertising spend. We market and sell our solutions to advertisers directly and through leading advertising agencies, and our customers collectively manage billions of dollars in advertising spend on our platform globally across a wide range of industries. We believe this makes us one of the largest providers of independent advertising cloud solutions. Our software solution is designed to help our customers:\n\u2022measure the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns through our proprietary reporting and analytics capabilities;\n\u2022manage and execute campaigns through our intuitive user interface and underlying technology that streamlines and automates key functions, such as advertisement creation and bidding, across multiple publishers and channels; and\n\u2022optimize campaigns across multiple publishers and channels based on market and business data to achieve desired revenue outcomes using our predictive bid management technology.\nOur current product lineup consists of MarinOne and our two legacy products, Marin Search and Marin Social. We have migrated all of our customers to use MarinOne as their primary experience when logging in. We will continue to allow access to Marin Search through at least the end of Q1 2022 to ensure a smooth transition for our customers.\n\u2022MarinOne. Our next-generation solution brings search, social and eCommerce advertising into a single-platform that helps advertisers maximize a customer journey that spans Google, Facebook, and Amazon by combining the power of Marin Search and Marin Social with newer channels like LinkedIn, Apple Search Ads, Instacart, Criteo, and YouTube.\n\u2022Marin Search. Our original solution for large advertisers and agencies, Marin Search is designed to provide search advertisers with the power, scale and flexibility required to manage large-scale advertising campaigns.\n\u2022Marin Social. Helps advertisers manage their Facebook, Instagram and Twitter advertising spend at scale.\nAdvertisers use our platform to create, target and convert precise audiences based on recent buying signals from users' search, social and eCommerce interactions. Our platform is integrated with leading publishers such as Amazon, Apple, Baidu, Bing, Criteo, Facebook, Google, Instacart, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, Yahoo!, Yahoo! Japan and Yandex. Additionally, we have integrations with dozens of leading web analytics and advertisement-serving solutions and key enterprise applications, enabling our customers to more accurately measure the return on investment of their marketing programs.\nOur software platform serves as an integration point for advertising performance, sales and revenue data, allowing advertisers to connect the dots between advertising spend and revenue outcomes. Through an intuitive interface, we enable our customers to simultaneously run large-scale digital advertising campaigns across multiple publishers and channels, making it easy for marketers to create, publish, modify and optimize campaigns.\nOur predictive bid management and optimization technology also allows advertisers to forecast outcomes and optimize campaigns across multiple publishers and channels to achieve their business goals. Our optimization technology can help advertisers\nincrease advertisement spend on those campaigns, publishers and channels that are performing well while reducing investment in those that are not. This category of solutions, which we refer to as cross-channel bid and campaign optimization, helps businesses intelligently and efficiently measure, manage, and optimize their digital advertising spend to achieve desired business results.\t\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have an adverse impact on many of our customers and their businesses and their spending on digital advertising and has had an adverse impact on our recent results of operations and may continue to affect our future results of operations. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including containment of COVID-19, effects of new variants, the availability, deployment and efficacy of vaccines, the transition from COVID-19 from being a pandemic to an endemic illness, impact on our customers and our sales cycles, and impact on our employees, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. At this time, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our financial condition or results of operations is uncertain. Since mid-March 2020, some of our customers have reduced the amount of digital advertising spend that they manage using our product which has had an adverse effect on our results of operations and some of our customers have requested extended payment terms, reduced fees or fee waivers, early contract terminations and other forms of contract relief. Also, since mid-March 2020 most of our employees have not been able to work from our offices and have been working from home, which could cause some disruptions or delays in our business activities, including our product development efforts.\nUnder the provisions of the extension of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act\u201d), we are eligible for a refundable employee retention credit subject to certain criteria. We recognized employee retention credits of $1.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, which was recorded in cost of revenues and operating expenses.\nDuring the third quarter of 2020, we commenced the implementation of a restructuring and reduction-in-force plan to reduce our operating costs and address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic ( 2020 Restructuring Plan\u201d). The 2020 Restructuring Plan included the reduction of our global workforce by approximately 60 employees, approximately half of which were located outside of the United States. The planned workforce reductions were substantially completed during 2020.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenues, Net\nWe generate revenues principally from subscription contracts under which we provide advertisers with access to our search, social and eCommerce advertising management platform, either directly or through the advertiser's relationship with an agency with whom we have a contract. Our subscription contracts are generally one year or less in length. Under subscription contracts with most of our direct advertisers and some independent agencies, we generally charge fees based on the amount of advertising spend that these customers manage through our platform or a contractual minimum monthly platform fee, whichever is greater. Certain of these customers are charged only a fixed monthly platform fee. Most of our subscription contracts with our network agency customers do not include a committed minimum monthly platform fee, and we charge fees based upon the amount of advertising spend that these customers manage through our platform. Due to the nature of the platform and the services performed under the subscription agreements, revenues are typically recognized in the amount billable to the advertiser.\nOur long-term strategic agreements have historically included multiple-year terms and are invoiced quarterly. Our largest agreement with Google was entered into in December 2018 with an effective date of October 1, 2018 (the Original Google Revenue Share Agreement\u201d) and included both a fixed baseline amount and a variable portion based on a percentage of relevant advertising search spend above the baseline threshold that runs through our technology platform. The Original Google Revenue Share Agreement had a three-year term; however, until March 2020, when we and Google executed the first amendment to the original agreement (the First Amendment\u201d), Google could terminate the Original Google Revenue Share Agreement after two years, with no penalty if we did not meet certain financial metrics. Accordingly, we accounted for the Original Google Revenue Share Agreement as a two-year agreement with one optional renewal year. The First Amendment removed the previous right of Google to terminate the Original Google Revenue Share Agreement after two years if we did not meet certain financial metrics and the Original Google Revenue Share Agreement continued for the third year until September 30, 2021. The revenue impact of the third year is being accounted for prospectively from the date of the First Amendment. The Original Google Revenue Share Agreement terminated on September 30, 2021. In September 2021, we entered into a New revenue share agreement with Google, with an effective date of October 1, 2021 (the \"New Google Revenue Share Agreement\") for a three-year term continuing until September 30, 2024. Under this New Google Revenue Share Agreement, we are eligible to receive fixed and variable revenue share payments based on a percentage of the search advertising spend that is managed through our platform. Our other long-term strategic agreements are generally variable in nature, based on a percentage of relevant search advertising spend that runs through our technology platform.\nThe majority of our revenues are derived from advertisers based in the United States. Advertisers from outside of the United States represented 23% and 25% of total revenues for 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Google Revenue Share Agreement accounted for approximately 35% of our revenues in 2021 and approximately 31% in 2020.\nRefer to Note 3 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our revenue recognition considerations.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues primarily includes personnel costs, consisting of salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation expense for employees associated with our cloud infrastructure and global services for implementation and ongoing customer service. Other costs of revenues include fees paid to contractors who supplement our support and data center personnel, expenses related to third-party data centers, depreciation of data center equipment, amortization of internally developed software, amortization of intangible assets and allocated overhead. Incremental cost of revenues associated with our long-term strategic agreements, including our largest agreement with Google, are generally not significant.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation expense and bonuses, as well as sales commissions and other costs including travel and entertainment, marketing and promotional events, lead generation activities, public relations, marketing activities, professional fees, amortization of intangible assets and allocated overhead. All of these costs are expensed as incurred, except sales commissions and the related payroll taxes, which are capitalized and amortized over the expected period of benefit in accordance with the relevant authoritative accounting guidance (refer to Note 3 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements). Our commission plans provide that commission payments to our sales representatives are paid based on the key components of the applicable customer contract, including the minimum or fixed monthly platform fee during the initial contract term.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our product development and engineering employees and executives, including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation expense and bonuses. Also included are non-personnel costs such as professional fees payable to third-party development resources, amortization of intangible assets and allocated overhead.\nOur research and development efforts are focused on enhancing our software architecture, adding new features and functionality to our platform and improving the efficiency with which we deliver these services to our customers, including the development of MarinOne.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation expense and bonuses for our administrative, legal, human resources, finance and accounting employees and executives. Also included are non-personnel costs, such as audit fees, tax services and legal fees, as well as professional fees, insurance and other corporate expenses, including allocated overhead.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net, primarily consists of sublease income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses, as well as interest income earned on our cash equivalents offset by the interest expense related to our outstanding note payable and finance lease liabilities.\nIncome Tax Benefit, Net\nThe benefit from income taxes consists of federal, state and foreign income taxes. Due to recent losses, we maintain a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2021. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, in assessing the extent to which a valuation allowance should be applied against our deferred tax assets.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table is a summary of our consolidated statements of operations for the specified periods and results of operations as a percentage of revenues for those periods. The period-to-period comparisons of results are not necessarily indicative of results for future periods. Percentage of revenues figures are rounded and therefore may not subtotal exactly.\nA discussion regarding our consolidated statements of operations and results of operations as a percentage of revenue for 2021 compared to 2020 is presented below.

GAAP. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss, adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, depreciation, the amortization of internally developed software, intangible assets, the capitalization of internally developed software, the impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, interest expense, net, the benefit from or provision for income taxes, CARES Act employee retention credits, other income or expenses, net, the non-recurring costs or gains associated with acquisitions, divestitures and restructurings, and certain professional fees that we have incurred in responding to third-party subpoenas that we have received related to governmental investigations of Google and Facebook. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net loss, operating loss or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We prepare Adjusted EBITDA to eliminate the impact of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance. Investors are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the following reasons:\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items such as stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, capitalized software development costs, interest expense, net, benefit from or provision for income taxes, other income or expenses, net and costs or gains associated with acquisitions, divestitures and restructurings, that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing, capital structures and the method by which assets were acquired;\n\u2022Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with GAAP financial measures for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of operating performance and the effectiveness of our business strategies and in communications with our Board of Directors concerning our financial performance; and\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA provides consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations and also facilitates comparisons with other peer companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results.\nWe understand that although Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, it has limitations as an analytical tool, and investors should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported under GAAP. These limitations include:\n\u2022Depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, and the assets being depreciated or amortized will often have to be replaced in the future; however, Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for these replacements;\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs or contractual commitments;\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements for income taxes and the cash impact of other income or expense; and\n\u2022Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net loss, the most comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated:\nTable 10: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12,944\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(14,051\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Amortization of internally developed software\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Benefit from income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(134\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(711\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>CARES Act employee retention credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,610\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Capitalization of internally developed software costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,377\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,869\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Restructuring related expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(984\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,533\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Third-party subpoena-related expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11,148\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,491\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nRevenues, Net\nTable 11: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenues, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,563\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues, net in 2021 decreased by $5.6 million, or 19%, as compared to 2020.

The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in the number of global services and cloud infrastructure personnel, which led to a decrease of $1.7 million in compensation and benefits expense, including stock-based compensation expense, as compared to 2020. This reduction in headcount also contributed to a decrease in allocated facilities and information technology costs of $0.4 million in 2021. We experienced a decrease of $0.8 million in hosting costs in 2021 due to a decline in usage of our hosting platform. Additionally, amortization of internally developed software costs decreased by $0.6 million, due primarily to the timing of the capitalization of certain internal projects as compared to 2020. There was also a decrease of $0.7 million in depreciation.\nWe expect cost of revenues to remain flat or increase slightly in the near term in absolute dollars as we should see savings in colocation expenses but may increase personnel costs.\nOur gross margin increased to 47% during 2021, as compared to 40% during 2020. This was primarily due to our costs declining at a faster rate than the corresponding decrease in revenues, net.\nSales and Marketing\nTable 13: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,476\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Percent of revenues, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales and marketing expenses in 2021 decreased by $1.5 million, or 21%, as compared to 2020. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the global sales support and marketing headcount, including reductions that were part of our restructuring activities during 2020, contributing to net decreases of $0.7 million in personnel-related costs, and $0.3 million in allocated facilities and information technology costs as compared to 2020.

Additionally there was a decrease of $0.3 million in equipment and professional fees.

From incorporation until our initial public offering, or the IPO, we raised $105.7 million, net of related issuance costs, in funding through private placements of our preferred stock. In March and April 2013, we raised net proceeds of $109.3 million in our IPO. In 2021 and 2020 we raised total net proceeds of $41.6 million and $7.5 million, respectively from at-the-market securities offering programs, and in 2020 we received proceeds of $3.3 million from a loan through the Paycheck Protection Program. An aggregate principal amount of $3.1 million of this loan was forgiven in January 2022 and we repaid the remaining outstanding balance of $0.2 million in February 2022. From time to time, we have also utilized equipment lines and entered into finance lease arrangements to fund capital purchases. As of December 31, 2021, our principal source of liquidity was our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $46.8 million. Our primary operating cash requirements include the payment of compensation and other employee-related expenses, as well as costs for our facilities and information technology infrastructure.\nWe maintain a $0.2 million irrevocable letter of credit to secure the non-cancelable lease for our corporate headquarters in San Francisco which is reflected as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nWe maintain cash balances in our foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2021, we had $46.8 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents in aggregate, of which $1.1 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA, which instituted fundamental changes to the taxation of multinational corporations. Among these changes is a mandatory one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of the accumulated earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries, and a tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries in excess of a specified return on the subsidiaries' tangible assets, known as the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, or GILTI. We also determined that no GILTI inclusion would be required in 2019 or 2020 as our foreign subsidiaries have accumulated significant losses. If funds held by our foreign subsidiaries were needed for our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue U.S. tax liabilities associated with the repatriation of these funds. However, given the amount of our net operating loss carryovers in the United States, such repatriation will most likely not result in material U.S. cash tax payments within the next year. Additionally, we do not believe that foreign withholding taxes associated with repatriating these funds would be material.\nOn March 14, 2019, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which was declared effective by the SEC on May 10, 2019, under which we could offer our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, subscription rights and units having an aggregate offering price of up to $50.0 million. As part of the shelf registration statement, we entered into an equity distribution agreement with JMP Securities LLC under which we could offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $13.0 million through an at-the-market offering program administered by JMP Securities. We were not required to sell any of our stock under this program. JMP Securities was entitled to compensation of up to 5.0% of the gross proceeds from sales of our common stock pursuant to the equity distribution agreement. We intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of securities under the equity distribution agreement primarily for working capital and general corporate purposes. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold 2.7 million shares of our common stock under this equity distribution agreement, and received proceeds of $7.5 million, net of offering costs of $0.5 million, at a weighted average sales price of $2.92 per share. During February 2021 we sold an additional 1.2 million shares of our common stock under this equity distribution agreement and received proceeds of $3.0 million, net of offering costs of $0.2 million, at a weighted average sales price of $2.68 per share. There are currently no additional amounts available to be sold under this equity distribution agreement. On July 15, 2021, we entered into a new equity distribution agreement with JMP Securities under which we could sell shares of our common stock up to an aggregate gross sales price of $40.0 million through a new at-the-market securities offering program. In July 2021, we sold 4.3 million shares of our common stock under this July\n2021 equity distribution agreement and received proceeds of $38.8 million, net of offering costs of $1.2 million, at a weighted average sales price of $9.27 per share, which exhausted all securities available for sale under this July 2021 equity distribution agreement.\nIn May 2020, we entered into a loan agreement with a lender for the loan in an aggregate principal amount of $3.3 million (the Loan\u201d) pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the PPP\u201d) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. We received the Loan proceeds on May 12, 2020. An aggregate principal amount of $3.1 million of the Loan was forgiven in January 2022 and we repaid the remaining outstanding balance of $0.2 million in February 2022. See Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this loan.\nWe have incurred significant losses in each fiscal year since our incorporation in 2006, and we expect to continue to incur losses and negative cash flows in the future.\nOn August 3, 2021, we filed a new shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which was declared effective by the SEC on August 19, 2021 and provides that we may offer our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, subscription rights and units having an aggregate offering price of up to $100.0 million. As part of this new 2021 registration statement, we entered into a third equity distribution agreement with JMP Securities and established a new $50.0 million at-the-market\u201d securities offering facility, pursuant to which we may be able to issue and sell shares of our common stock. We have not yet sold any shares under this August 2021 equity distribution agreement and no assurances can be provided as to if or when me may be able to sell any shares or the terms of any such sales. In accordance with the SEC's Instruction I.B.6 of Registration Statement on Form S-3, we are adjusting the maximum aggregate market value of the securities that may be sold pursuant to this current \"at-the-market\" securities offering facility from $50.0 million to approximately $22.8 million based on our estimated market capitalization on the date we file this Annual Report until such time when we are eligible to conduct such offering in accordance with Instruction I.B.1 of the Registration Statement on Form S-3.\nSummary of Cash Flows\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,942\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,675\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,296\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,884\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net increase in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nCash used in operating activities is primarily influenced by the amount of cash we invest in personnel and infrastructure to support the operation of our business and the fluctuations in the number of advertisers using our platform. Cash used in operating activities has typically been affected by net losses and further increased by changes in our operating assets and liabilities, particularly in the areas of accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities, adjusted for non-cash expense items such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense and deferred income tax benefits.\nCash used in operating activities in 2021 of $7.9 million was primarily the result of a net loss of $12.9 million, which was partially offset by non-cash expenses of $4.9 million, primarily consisting of depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, provision for bad debts and net changes in operating leases, and a $0.1 million net change in working capital items. These items consisted most notably of (1) a decrease in accounts receivable of $0.6 million due to the decrease in revenues and the timing of related collections and (2) a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities (both current and non-current) of $0.9 million due to the timing of related disbursements and lower accrued payroll-related costs driven by lower headcount.\nCash used in operating activities in 2020 of $5.7 million was primarily the result of a net loss of $14.1 million, which was partially offset by non-cash expenses of $6.8 million, primarily consisting of depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, provision for bad debts and net changes in operating leases, and a $1.6 million net change in working capital items. These items consisted most notably of (1) a decrease in accounts receivable of $4.1 million due to the decrease in revenues and the timing of\nrelated collections and (2) a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities (both current and non-current) of $2.5 million due to the timing of related disbursements and lower accrued payroll-related costs driven by lower headcount.\nInvesting Activities\nIn 2021 and 2020, investing activities primarily consisted of $1.3 million and $1.9 million of capitalized internally developed software costs. Capital expenditures may vary from period-to-period due to the timing of our operational requirements and the development cycles of our internally-developed hosted software platform. We expect to continue to invest in the development of our software platform for the foreseeable future.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities in 2021 was $41.5 million. This primarily consisted of $41.9 million of net cash proceeds from the issuance of common shares pursuant to our equity distribution agreements with JMP Securities, partially offset by $0.4 million in employee taxes paid for withheld shares upon the settlement of equity awards.\nCash provided by financing activities in 2020 was $10.2 million. This primarily consisted of $7.7 million of net cash proceeds from the issuance of common shares pursuant to our equity distribution agreement with JMP Securities and $3.3 million net proceeds from our Loan pursuant to the PPP under the CARES Act, partially offset by $0.6 million of net repayments under our right-of-use finance lease liabilities and $0.2 million in employee taxes paid for withheld shares upon the settlement of equity awards.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nOur principal commitments consist of operating leases for office space, net of sublease income. As of December 31, 2021, the future minimum payments under these commitments, were as follows:\n "}
