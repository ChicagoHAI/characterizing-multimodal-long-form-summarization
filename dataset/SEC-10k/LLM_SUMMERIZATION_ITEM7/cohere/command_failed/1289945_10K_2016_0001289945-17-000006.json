MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND STATEMENT OF INCOME\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and the discussion under Application of Critical Accounting Policies\u201d (also under Item 7), which describes key estimates and assumptions we make in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements; the cautionary language that appears under the title \"Forward Looking Statements\" immediately following the Table of Contents; Item 1. Business,\u201d which describes our operations; and Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d which describes key risks associated with our operations and markets in which we operate. A reference to a Note\u201d in this section refers to the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOverview and Highlights\nWe are a comprehensive provider of critical communication solutions for enterprises. We offer a suite of unified critical communication solutions that include call center operations, clinical alerting and notifications, one-way and advanced two-way wireless messaging services, mobile communications and public safety response. Our customers rely on Spok for workflow improvement, secure texting, paging services, contact center optimization and public safety response. Our product offerings are capable of addressing a customer's mission critical communications needs. We develop, sell and support enterprise-wide systems for healthcare and other organizations needing to automate, centralize and standardize their approach to critical communications. Our solutions can be found in prominent hospitals; large government agencies; leading public safety institutions, colleges and universities; large hotels, resorts and casinos; and well-known manufacturers. Our primary market has been the healthcare industry, particularly hospitals. We have identified hospitals with 200 or more beds as the primary targets for our software and wireless solutions.\nRevenue generated by wireless messaging services (including voice mail, personalized greeting, message storage and retrieval) and equipment loss and/or maintenance protection to both one-way and two-way messaging subscribers is presented as wireless revenue in our statements of income. Revenue generated by the sale of our software solutions, which includes software license, professional services (installation, consulting and training), equipment procured by us from third parties (to be used in conjunction with our software) and post-contract support (on-going maintenance), is presented as software revenue in our statements of income. Our software is licensed to end users under an industry standard software license agreement.\nThe following tables present wireless and software revenue by key market segments for the periods stated and illustrate the relative significance of these market segments to our operations.\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Wireless\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Software\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Wireless\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Software\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Wireless\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Software\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nTotal\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Healthcare\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>126,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>129,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Government\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Large Enterprise\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>179,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>200,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Other includes hospitality, resort, indirect and billable travel revenue.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> 2016 Highlights\nNet sales declined by 5.3% or $10.1 million during 2016 compared to 2015, driven primarily by a continued and expected decline in wireless revenue while software revenue decreased slightly for the same period. Our operating expenses declined by 4.3% or $7.1 million during 2016 compared to 2015, driven primarily by reduction in all functional categories partially offset by an increase in research and development expenses attributable to our continued investment in the development of Spok Care Connect. We are committed to increasing our research and development spend throughout 2017 as we look to continue developing new products and services as well as enhancements for our current suite of solutions. We returned approximately $22.0 million of capital to our stockholders in the form of cash dividends and share repurchases which includes the special dividend declared in December 2016 but was paid in January 2017.\n2015 Highlights\nNet sales declined by 5.3% or $10.6 million during 2015 compared to 2014, driven primarily by a continued and expected decline in wireless revenue partially offset by solid growth in software maintenance revenue. Year-over-year paging unit erosion improved to a low of 6.6% during 2015 which was a decrease of 2.1% compared to 2014. Operating expenses declined by 4.4% or $7.6 million during 2015 compared to 2014, driven primarily by a reduction in general and administrative as well as lower depreciation, amortization and accretion costs. We reduced our deferred income tax asset valuation allowance by $64.2 million based on our analysis and expectation that these assets would now be realized in the future prior to expiration. We returned approximately $29.0 million of capital to our stockholders in the form of cash dividends and share repurchases.\nWireless Revenue\nOur core offering includes subscriptions to one-way or two-way messaging services for a periodic (monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or annual) service fee. This is generally based upon the type of service provided, the geographic area covered, the number of devices provided to the customer and the period of commitment. A subscriber to one-way messaging services may select coverage on a local, regional or nationwide basis to best meet their messaging needs. Two-way messaging is generally offered on a nationwide basis. In addition, subscribers either contract for a messaging device from us for an additional fixed monthly fee or they own a device, having purchased it either from us or from another vendor. We also sell devices to resellers who lease or resell devices to their subscribers and then sell messaging services utilizing our networks. We offer ancillary services, such as voicemail and equipment loss or maintenance protection, which help increase the monthly recurring revenue we receive along with these traditional messaging services. In 2015 and 2016 we launched new and exclusive one-way (T5) and two-way (T52) alphanumeric pagers, respectively. Both pagers are configurable to support un-encrypted or encrypted operation. When configured for encryption, they utilize AES-128 bit encryption, screen locking and remote wipe capabilities. With encryption enabled these new secure paging devices enhance our service offerings to the healthcare community by adding Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\"HIPAA\") security capabilities to the low cost, highly reliable and availability benefits of paging. (See Item 1. Business\u201d for more details.)\nSoftware Revenue\nSoftware revenue consists of two primary components: operations revenue and maintenance revenue. Operations revenue consists of license revenue, professional services revenue, and equipment revenue. Maintenance revenue is for ongoing support of a software application or equipment (typically for one year). We recognize equipment revenue when it is shipped or delivered to the customer depending on the delivery method of Free on Board (\"FOB\") shipping or FOB destination, respectively. License, professional services and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the longer of the period of professional services delivery to the customer or the contractual term of the maintenance agreement. If the period of delivery to the customer is not known, license and professional services revenue will be recognized when software and professional services are fully delivered to the customer and the maintenance revenue will be recognized ratably over the remaining contractual term of the agreement.\nOperations - Consolidated\nOur operating expenses are presented in functional categories. Certain of our functional categories are especially important to overall expense control and management. These operating expenses are categorized as follows:\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cost of revenue. These are expenses primarily for hardware, third-party software, outside service expenses and payroll and related expenses for our professional services, logistics, customer support and maintenance staff.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Research and Development. These expenses relate primarily to the development of new software products and the ongoing maintenance and enhancement of existing products. This classification consists primarily of employee payroll and related expenses, outside services related to the design, development, testing and enhancement of our solutions and to a lesser extent hardware equipment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Service, rental and maintenance. These are expenses associated with the operation of our paging networks. Expenses consist largely of site rent expenses for transmitter locations, telecommunication expenses to deliver messages over our paging networks, and payroll and related expenses for our engineering and pager repair functions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Selling and marketing. The sales and marketing staff are involved in selling our communication solutions primarily in the United States. These expenses support our efforts to maintain gross placements of units in service, which mitigated the impact of disconnects on our wireless revenue base, and to identify business opportunities for additional or future software sales. We have a centralized marketing function, which is focused on supporting our products and vertical sales efforts by strengthening our brand, generating sales leads and facilitating the sales process. These marketing functions are accomplished through targeted email campaigns, webinars, regional and national user conferences, monthly newsletters and participation at industry trade shows. Expenses consist largely of payroll and related expenses, commissions and other costs such as travel and advertising costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>General and administrative. These are expenses associated with information technology and administrative functions. This classification consists primarily of payroll and related expenses, outside service expenses, taxes, licenses and permit expenses, and facility rent expenses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We review the percentages of these operating expenses to revenue on a regular basis. Even though the operating expenses are classified as described above, expense control and management are also performed by expense category. Approximately 65.6%, 62.5% and 60.6% of the operating expenses referred to above were incurred in payroll and related expenses, site and facility rent expenses and telecommunication expenses for each the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nOur largest expense, payroll and related expenses, includes wages, commissions, incentives, employee benefits and related taxes. On a monthly basis, we review the number of employees in major functional categories and the design and physical locations of functional groups to continuously improve efficiency, to simplify organizational structures, and to minimize the number of physical locations for the Company. We had 587 full-time equivalent employees ( FTEs\u201d) at December 31, 2016, a decrease of 2.2% from 600 FTEs at December 31, 2015. We very recently announced plans to hire up to 60 new employees over the next 18 to 24 months, with the majority of new hires to occur during 2017. Nearly all of the new hires will be working in software development and supporting areas for our planned integrated communications platform, Spok Care Connect.\nWe operate local, regional, and nationwide one-way and two-way paging networks. These networks each require locations on which to place transmitters, receivers, and antennae. Site rent expenses for transmitter locations are highly dependent on the number of transmitters, which in turn is dependent on the number of networks. In addition, these expenses generally do not vary directly with the number of subscribers or units in service, which is detrimental to our operating margins as revenue declines. In order to reduce these expenses, we have an active program to consolidate the number of paging networks, and thus transmitter locations, which we refer to as network rationalization. We have reduced the number of active transmitters by 2.0% to 4,159 active transmitters at December 31, 2016 from 4,243 active transmitters at December 31, 2015.\nTelecommunication expenses are incurred to interconnect our paging networks and to provide telephone numbers for customer use, points of contact for customer service, and connectivity among our offices. These expenses are dependent on the number of units in service, the number of customers we support and the number of office and network locations that we maintain. However, the number or duration of telephone calls to call centers may vary from period to period based on factors other than the number of units in service or customers, which could cause telecommunication expenses to vary.\nStatements of Income\nComparison of Statement of Income Elements for the Years Ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td>

respectively, reflects the decrease in demand for our wireless services. Paging revenue consists primarily of recurring fees associated with the provision of messaging services and fees for paging devices and is net of a provision for service credits. Product and other revenue reflects system sales, the sale of devices and charges for paging devices that are not returned and are net of anticipated credits.\nThe demand for one-way and two-way messaging declined at each specified date and we believe demand will continue to decline for the foreseeable future. Demand for our services has also been impacted by the shift from narrow band wireless service offerings to broad band technology services by our competition.\nAs demand for one-way and two-way messaging has declined, we have developed or added service offerings such as encrypted paging and Spok Mobile with a pager number in order to increase our revenue potential and mitigate the decline in our wireless revenue. We will continue to explore ways to innovate and provide customers the highest value possible. Software revenue is anticipated to increase, while the wireless revenue is expected to continue to decrease reflecting the changing technology expectations of our customer base.\nWireless revenue is generally based upon the number of units in service and the monthly charge per unit. The number of units in service changes based on subscribers added, referred to as gross placements, less subscriber cancellations, or disconnects. The net of gross placements and disconnects is commonly referred to as net gains or losses of units in service or the net disconnect rate. The absolute number of gross placements as well as the number of gross placements relative to average units in service in a period, referred to as the gross placement rate, is monitored on a monthly basis. Disconnects are also monitored on a monthly basis. The ratio of units disconnected in a period to average units in service for the same period, called the disconnect rate, is an indicator of our success at retaining subscribers, which is important in order to maintain recurring revenue and to control operating expenses.\nThe following table sets forth information on our units in service by account size at specified dates:\nTable 101:

measurement on a consolidated basis is affected by several factors, including the mix of units in service and the pricing of the various components of our services. We expect future annual revenue to decline in line with recent trends. The decrease in consolidated ARPU for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to the change in composition of our customer base as the percentage of units in service attributable to larger customers continues to increase. These larger customers benefit from lower pricing associated with their larger number of units-in-service. We believe that without further price adjustments, ARPU will trend lower in 2017. ARPU may further be affected by lower prices for broad band wireless services offered by our competitors. Any price increases could mitigate, but not completely offset, the expected declines in both ARPU and revenue.\nThe following reflects the impact of subscribers and ARPU on the change in wireless revenue:\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Units in Service As of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Revenue For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change Due To:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>ARPU\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Units\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Units in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>1,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(62\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,059\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,886\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,173\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Units in Service as of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Revenue For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change Due To:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>ARPU\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Units\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Units in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>1,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(83\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>125,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11,094\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,236\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,858\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs previously discussed, demand for messaging services has declined over the past several years and we anticipate that it will continue to decline for the foreseeable future, which would result in reductions in wireless revenue due to the decreased number of subscribers and related units in service.\nRevenue -

Starting in late 2015, we began a reorganization of the sales staff and related sales territories, which realigned territories and replaced lower performing sales employees with new staff. The decrease in operational bookings during 2015 and 2016 also factored into the decrease in operational revenue for the same period. The decrease in operations revenue during 2015 when compared to 2014 primarily reflects lower sales of software to new customers which was reflected in the decrease in license revenue.\nThe continued increase in maintenance revenue for each of the periods stated reflects our continuing success in renewals of our maintenance support for existing software solutions and in maintenance support for sales of new solutions. The maintenance renewal rates for the year ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were in excess of 99%. We achieve very high maintenance renewal rates compared to many companies that have software offerings, and we may experience a downward trend in maintenance renewal as communications technology and services continue to advance, and customers have more choices and opportunities to shift to newer solutions for their communication and work flow needs.\nOur software revenue is dependent on the conversion of our software bookings into revenues. On a regular basis, we enter into contractual arrangements with our customers to provide software licenses, professional services, and equipment sales. In addition, we enter into contractual arrangements for maintenance with our customers on new solutions or renewals of existing solutions. These contractual arrangements are reported as bookings and represent future revenue.\nThe following table summarizes total bookings for the periods stated:\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bookings\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operations and new maintenance orders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,979\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,548\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance and subscription renewals\n</td> <td>40,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total bookings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(169\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,491\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in bookings during 2016 when compared to 2015 primarily reflects a decrease in the number of new operations orders and new maintenance orders from fewer new installations, partially offset by the continued success of maintenance and subscription renewals. Starting in late 2015, the Company undertook a reorganization of the sales staff and related sales territories. As part of that reorganization, the Company has replaced lower performing sales employees with new staff. The Company is unable to predict the impact of this reorganization on the level and timing of future software operations bookings. The Company is also migrating its sales focus from individual software solutions to its integrated solution portfolio. The change in sales focus has impacted bookings as the focus on the integrated solution portfolio requires a longer sales cycle to achieve completion. The maintenance bookings continue to reflect a strong renewal rate in excess of 99%.\nOperations and new orders in 2014 reflect $6.7 million of one-time bookings for a U.S. government entity which is the primary reason for the decrease in bookings during 2015 when compared to 2014.

For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 other income, net decreased by $0.6 million due primarily to $0.8 million related to the sale of two land parcels in 2015 that did not occur in 2016 partially offset by $0.2 million related to a reduction in the total estimated royalty liability for the purchase of IMCO in 2012. The increase of $1.6 million in other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, was due primarily to $0.8 million related to the sale of two land parcels and $0.3 million related to dividend income.\nIncome tax expense (benefit). Spok's income tax expense (benefit) has fluctuated for the periods presented below, largely due to non-cash adjustments related to our deferred income tax assets and related valuation allowance. The effects of foreign taxes are immaterial for all periods presented. The following is the effective tax rate reconciliation for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively (See Note 8, \"Income Taxes\", for further discussion on our income taxes):\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate reconciliation\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income tax expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Federal income tax expense at the Federal statutory rate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>State income taxes, net of Federal benefit\n</td> <td>867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in valuation allowance\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(64,159\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(244.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,087\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, including permanent differences\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(53,948\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(205.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome tax expense increased by $62.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due primarily to a $64.2 million one-time favorable adjustment to the deferred income tax asset (\"DTA\") valuation allowance in 2015. This was partially offset by $1.2 million in lower income tax expense related to a decrease of $3.3 million in income before income tax expense and $0.1 million in other changes. The decrease of $60.5 million in income tax expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 was due primarily to a $59.1 million greater reduction in the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance in 2015 than in 2014 and $1.4 million in other changes. The favorable adjustments to the DTA valuation allowance in both 2015 and 2014 relate to our assessment on the probability of future recoverability of our DTAs.\nThe pro-forma effective tax rate excludes the effects of the change in the valuation allowance and the change in the deferred income tax assets to provide a more comparable effective tax rate. The following are the pro-forma effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively:\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Pro forma effective tax rate\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>39.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(205.1\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in valuation allowance\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>244.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pro-forma effective tax rate\n</td> <td>39.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAt December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $125.8 million. The available cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third-party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in our operating accounts. The invested cash is invested in interest bearing funds managed by third-party financial institutions. These funds invest in direct obligations of the government of the United States. To date, we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our invested cash or cash equivalents; however, we can provide no assurance that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse market conditions.\nAt any point in time, we have approximately $7.0 to $12.0 million in our operating accounts that are with third-party financial institutions. While we monitor daily the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate, these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or are subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets. To date, we have experienced no loss or lack of access to cash in our operating accounts.\nWe intend to use our cash on hand to provide working capital, to support operations, to invest in our business and to return value to stockholders through cash dividends and possible repurchases of our common stock. We may also consider using cash to fund or complete opportunistic investments and acquisitions that we believe will provide a measure of growth or revenue stability while supporting our existing operations. Because we intend to increase substantially our investment in developing our integrated communications platform over the next two or three years commensurate with declining revenues from our wireless business, we anticipate that our cash on hand will decrease significantly during that period and possibly longer until revenues from our Spok Care Connect platform begin to be realized.\nOverview\nIn the event that net cash provided by operating activities and cash on hand are not sufficient to meet future cash requirements, we may be required to reduce planned capital expenses, reduce or eliminate our cash dividends to stockholders, not resume our common stock repurchase program, and/or sell assets or seek additional financing. We can provide no assurance that reductions in planned capital expenses or proceeds from asset sales would be sufficient to cover shortfalls in available cash or that additional financing would be available on acceptable terms. As of December 31, 2016, our available cash on hand was $125.8 million.\nBased on current and anticipated levels of operations, we anticipate net cash provided by operating activities, together with the available cash on hand at December 31, 2016, should be adequate to meet anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future.\nThe following table sets forth information on our net cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the periods stated:\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change Between 2016 and 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,376\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(6,254\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,565\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,614\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(689\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>(16,723\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32,809\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15,151\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities. As discussed above, we are dependent on cash flows from operating activities to meet our cash requirements. Cash from operations varies depending on changes in various working capital items, including deferred revenues, accounts payable, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and various accrued expenses. Net cash provided by operating activities reflects the reclassification of $3.8 million to net cash used in financing activities associated with employee stock based compensation tax withholding. Excluding this reclassification, net cash provided by operating activities decreased $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due primarily to a decrease in net income, net of adjustments related to deferred income tax benefit (expense) of $4.3 million (decrease in cash flow), a decrease of $1.0 million in depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses (decrease in cash flow), a decrease of $1.0 million in stock based compensation expenses (decrease in cash flow) partially offset by $0.7 million in other non-cash items (increase in cash flow). With respect to changes in assets and liabilities the net cash provided by operating activities reflects an $8.4 million greater increase in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other (increase in cash flow), $0.7 million lower increase in deferred revenue (decrease in cash flow) and a net $2.7 million greater increase to assets (decrease in cash flow).\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities increased $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due primarily to lower proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment.\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities decreased $16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from the same period in 2015 due primarily to $2.6 million less in special dividends paid, an $8.6 million decrease in common stock repurchases, net of proceeds from the issuance of common stock, $0.6 million related to the payment of accumulated cash dividends earned on vested RSUs from the 2011 LTIP in 2015 and $0.5 million related to a reduction in the quarterly dividend payment as a result of less common stock outstanding in 2016 as compared to 2015 . The remaining offset was related to the early adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 and the reclassification of $3.8 million in employee stock based compensation for tax withholding purposes for the year ended December 31, 2015 (See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding ASU No. 2016-09).\nCash Dividends to Stockholders. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we paid a total of $10.3 million in cash dividends compared to $14.0 million in cash dividends for the same period in 2015. Cash dividends paid to stockholders in 2016 decreased by $3.7 million primarily due to $0.6 million related to the payment of accumulated cash dividends earned on vested RSU from the 2011 LTIP in 2015 and $0.5 million related to a reduction in the quarterly dividend payment as a result of less common stock outstanding in 2016 as compared to 2015 and $2.6 million related to a special dividend of $0.125 which was declared and paid in 2015.\nFuture Cash Dividends to Stockholders. On December 20, 2016 our Board of Directors declared a special dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock, with a record date of January 4, 2017, and a payment date of January 17, 2017. This cash dividend of approximately $5.2 million will be paid from available cash on hand. On March 1, 2017, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share of common stock, with a record date of March 17, 2017, and a payment date of March 30, 2017. This cash dividend of approximately $2.6 million will be paid from available cash on hand.\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we purchased 388,255 shares of our common stock under the repurchase program for $6.4 million, net of proceeds from the issuance of common stock. The repurchase authority allows us, at management's discretion, to selectively repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market depending upon market price and other factors. The Company's Board of Directors did not reset the repurchase authority under the share repurchase program for 2017 and the previous authority expired on December 31, 2016. (See Note 7, \"Stockholders' Equity\", for further discussion on our common stock repurchase program.)\nBorrowings. On November 8, 2011 we executed the First Amendment to our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement ( Amended Credit Agreement\u201d) with Wells Fargo Capital Finance, LLC ( Wells Fargo\u201d). The Amended Credit Agreement increased the amount of the revolving credit facility to $40.0 million. The maturity date for the revolving credit facility was September 3, 2015. The Amended Credit Agreement also revised the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) definition to eliminate the LIBOR floor and reduced the interest rate margin to 3.25%. Borrowings under this facility were secured by a lien on substantially all of the existing assets, interests in assets\nand proceeds owned or acquired by us. We were subject to certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis under the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement. These financial covenants consisted of a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio.\nOn December 15, 2014, we terminated the Amended Credit Agreement and underlying revolving credit facility. At the time the revolving credit facility was terminated, we were in compliance with all the required financial covenants and did not incur any early termination penalties. As of December 31, 2016, we had no outstanding debt.\nOther. For 2017, the Board of Directors currently expects to pay dividends of $0.125 per common share each quarter, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors, in 2017.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nContractual Obligations. The following table provides the Company's significant commitments and contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016.\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due By Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 to 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 to 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>3,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2016, our contractual payment obligations under our operating leases for office and transmitter locations are indicated in the table above. For purposes of the table above, purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, legally binding, noncancelable, has a remaining term in excess of one year and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable pricing provisions; and the approximate timing of transactions. These purchase obligations primarily relate to commitments to purchase a minimum number of pagers. The amounts are based on our contractual commitments; however, it is possible that we may be able to negotiate lower payments if we choose to exit these contracts before their expiration date. See Note 10, \"Commitments and Contingencies\", for further discussion on commitments and contingencies.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements. We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.\nRelated Parties\nSee Note 12, \"Related Parties\", for further discussion on our related party transactions.\nInflation\nInflation has not had a material effect on our operations to date. System equipment and operating costs have not significantly increased in price, and the price of wireless messaging devices has tended to decline in recent years. This reduction in costs has generally been reflected in lower prices charged to subscribers who purchase their wireless messaging devices. Our general operating expenses, such as salaries, site rent for transmitter locations, employee benefits and occupancy costs, are subject to normal inflationary pressures.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preceding discussion and analysis of financial condition and statement of income is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1, \"Organization and Significant Accounting Policies\", of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or condition.\nManagement believes the Company's critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, asset retirement obligations, income taxes and the impairment of long-lived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization and goodwill. Management considers these policies critical because of the significant judgment and estimates inherent within each process and their importance to the overall presentation of the Company's financial statements and operating results. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when four basic criteria have been met:\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>delivery has occurred or services rendered;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the fee is fixed or determinable; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>collectability is reasonably assured.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Amounts billed to customers, but not meeting the above revenue recognition criteria are deferred until all four criteria have been met.\nSigned agreements are used as evidence of an arrangement. If a contract signed by the customer does not exist, we use a purchase order as evidence of an arrangement. If both a signed contract and a purchase order exist, we consider the signed contract to be the final persuasive evidence of an arrangement. At the time a contract is executed, we evaluate the contract to assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable. If the fee is assessed as not being fixed or determinable, revenue recognition is delayed until this assessment can be made. Additionally, we review customer creditworthiness and our historical ability to collect payments when due.\nOur wireless revenue consists primarily of service, rental and maintenance fees charged to customers on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. Revenue also includes the sale of messaging devices directly to customers and other companies that resell our services. With respect to revenue recognition for multiple deliverables, we evaluated these revenue arrangements and determined that two separate units of accounting exist, paging service revenue and product sales. We recognize paging service revenue over the period the service is performed; revenue from product sales is recognized at the time of shipment or installation. We have a variety of billing arrangements with our customers resulting in deferred revenue from advance billings and accounts receivables for billing in-arrears arrangements.\nOur software revenue consists primarily of the sale of software (license fees), professional services (primarily installation and training), equipment (to be used in conjunction with the software) and maintenance support (post-contract support). The software is licensed to end users under an industry standard software license agreement. Our software products are considered to be off-the-shelf software\u201d as the software is marketed as a stock item that customers can use without customization.\nSoftware revenue consists of two primary components: (1) operations revenue consisting of software license revenue, professional services revenue and equipment revenue, and (2) maintenance revenue.\nWe generally sell software licenses, professional services, equipment and maintenance in multiple-element arrangements. At inception of the arrangement, we allocate the arrangement consideration to the software deliverables (software licenses, professional services and maintenance) as a group and to the non-software deliverables (equipment and maintenance on equipment, when applicable) using the relative selling price method. When performing this allocation, the estimated selling price for each deliverable is based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value ( VSOE\u201d), third party evidence of fair value ( TPE\u201d), or if VSOE and TPE are not available, the best estimated selling price ( BESP\u201d) for selling the element on a stand-alone basis. We have determined that TPE is not a practical alternative due to differences in our service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. The amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue, if any.\nOur standard post contract support (maintenance) is allocated using VSOE as an input in the relative selling price allocation. For software licenses, professional services, equipment and premium maintenance we have determined that neither VSOE nor TPE is available and as such, we have used BESP as an input in order to allocate our arrangement fees. We determine BESP by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices take into consideration our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where our services are sold, our price lists, our go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and contract prices. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by management, taking into consideration the go-to-market strategy. As our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in relative selling prices, including both VSOE and BESP.\nIn multiple-element arrangements, the arrangement consideration allocated to our non-software deliverables (equipment) is generally recognized upon shipment or delivery to the customer depending on delivery method of Free on Board (\"FOB\") shipping or FOB destination, respectively.\nFor our software deliverables, which include software licenses, professional services, and post contract support (maintenance), we further allocate arrangement consideration using the residual method. As noted above, we have not established VSOE for our software licenses, professional services and premium maintenance. However, we have established, and continue to maintain, VSOE for our standard post contract support (maintenance). We recognize contract revenue ratably over the longer of the estimated services delivery period or the maintenance term. If delivery of the software and services is completed before the end of the maintenance period, then the remaining deferred revenue associated with these elements is recognized in full at this time. Any unrecognized revenue related to maintenance continues to be recognized ratably over the remaining term of the maintenance period. If the period of delivery to the customer is not known, license and professional services revenue will be recognized when software and professional services are fully delivered to the customer and the maintenance revenue will be recognized ratably over the remaining contractual term of the agreement. Prior to January 1, 2014, we did not have a method for reasonably estimating the services period and therefore, license and professional services revenue was primarily recognized at the time of full delivery. In 2014, we developed a methodology for reasonably estimating the services period and have been able to recognize license and professional services revenue ratably on most contracts. Generally, the defined services period for most of our projects is shorter than the maintenance term.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe recognize liabilities and corresponding assets for future obligations associated with the retirement of assets. We have paging equipment assets, principally transmitters, which are located on leased locations. The underlying leases generally require the removal of equipment at the end of the lease term; therefore, a future obligation exists. Asset retirement costs are reflected in paging equipment assets with depreciation expense recognized over the estimated lives, which range between one and five years. The asset retirement costs and the corresponding liabilities that have been recorded to date generally relate to either current plans to consolidate networks or to the removal of assets at a future terminal date.\nThe primary variables associated with these estimates are the number of transmitters and related equipment to be removed, the timing of removal, and a fair value estimate of the outside contractor fees to remove each asset. The fair value estimate of contractor fees to remove each asset is assumed to escalate by 4% each year through the terminal date. The total estimated liability is based on transmitter locations remaining after we have consolidated the number of networks we operate and assume the underlying leases continue to be renewed to that future date.\nWe believe these estimates are reasonable at the present time, but we can give no assurance that changes in technology, our financial condition, the economy or other factors would not result in higher or lower asset retirement obligations. Any variations from our estimates would generally result in a change in the assets and liabilities in equal amounts, and operating results would differ in the future by any difference in depreciation expense and accretion expense.\nIncome Taxes - Uncertainties and Deferred Income Tax Assets (\"DTAs\")\nWe file our income tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We are required to evaluate the recoverability of our DTAs. The assessment is to determine whether based on all available evidence, it is more likely than not (i.e., greater than a 50% probability) that all or some portion of the DTAs will be realized in the future.\nThe DTA valuation allowance reflects management's judgment concerning the ultimate recoverability of the DTAs. At December 31, 2016, Spok did not have a valuation allowance.\nWe consider both positive and negative evidence when evaluating the recoverability of our DTAs. During the fourth quarter of each year, we prepare a multi-year forecast of taxable income for our operations. In preparing our analysis of the recoverability of our DTAs, we consider the following possible sources of taxable income:\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1.\n</td> <td>Future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We consider 100% of our existing taxable temporary differences when estimating the amount of recoverable DTAs.\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2.\n</td> <td>Future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> As described above, we use a multi-year forecast of taxable income for the Company. DTAs are realizable if future deductible amounts would reduce taxes that would be paid on future taxable income excluding the reversal of existing temporary differences.\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3.\n</td> <td>Taxable income in carryback years to the extent permitted by tax law.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We have exhausted our carryback potential and now only have carryforwards available.\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4.\n</td> <td>Tax planning strategies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSince 2012, we have elected to capitalize and amortize over 10 years, software research and development costs. In the near term, this has the effect of increasing taxable income and the amount of net operating losses utilized.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets Subject to Amortization and Goodwill\nWe are required to evaluate the carrying value of our long-lived assets, amortizable intangible assets and goodwill. Amortizable intangible assets include customer related intangibles, technology based intangibles, contract based intangibles and marketing intangibles that primarily resulted from our previous acquisitions. Such intangibles are being amortized over periods up to ten years. Quarterly, we assess whether circumstances exist which suggest that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When applicable, we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of our long-lived assets and certain amortizable intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from such assets. In assessing the recoverability of these assets, we forecasted estimated enterprise-level cash flows based on operating assumptions such as revenue forecasted by product line. If the forecast of undiscounted cash flows did not exceed the carrying value of the long-lived assets, we would record an impairment charge to the extent the carrying value exceeded the fair value of such assets.\nGoodwill resulting from our acquisitions is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or when events or circumstances suggest a potential impairment has occurred. We evaluate goodwill for impairment between annual tests if indicators of impairment exist. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. If the reporting unit's fair value is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, we compare the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. The amount by which the implied fair value is less than the carrying value of the goodwill, if any, is recognized as an impairment loss. For purposes of the goodwill impairment evaluation, the Company as a whole is considered the reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated under a market based approach using the fair value of the Company's common stock. A confirmatory discounted cash flow analysis is also used to assess whether impairment exists. This calculation requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.\nRecent and Pending Accounting Standards\nRevenue\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Since this ASU was issued, the FASB has issued several updates including ASU No. 2015-14 in July 2015 which delayed the effective date, ASU No. 2016-08 in March 2016 which updated guidance related to principal versus agent considerations, ASU No. 2016-10 in April 2016 which updated guidance related to the identification of performance obligations, ASU No. 2016-12 in May 2016 which updated guidance related to scope improvements and practical expedients and ASU No. 2016-20 which provided technical corrections and improvements but did not update guidance issued in prior updates. The effective date is January 1, 2018, and while early adoption to the original effective date of January 1, 2017 is permitted, we have elected not to early adopt.\nASU No. 2014-09 creates a five-step model that requires companies to exercise judgment when considering all relevant facts and circumstances in the determination of when and how revenue is recognized. The two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method, in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented, or the modified retrospective method, in which case the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application. We have completed our review of the acceptable transition methods and have selected the modified retrospective approach. We currently believe the modified retrospective approach will have a material impact on both deferred revenue and retained earnings in our 2018 consolidated financial statements.\nWe currently believe the standard will materially impact our revenue recognition on a going-forward basis once adopted. While we continue to assess the potential impacts of this standard, we currently believe that the most significant impact relates to our accounting for software license revenue. We expect software license revenue to be recognized at the time of shipment rather than over a combined service period or subscription period. Due to the nuances of certain contracts the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the standard will be dependent on contract-specific terms and may vary in some instances from recognition at the time of shipment.\nLeases\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases. The new standard establishes a right of use ( ROU\u201d) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than twelve months. Leases will be classified as either financing or operating with the classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement.\nASU No. 2016-02 will be effective for fiscal years beginning on January 1, 2019, including the related interim periods and early adoption of the standard is permitted. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. While we are still evaluating the impact of the potential new standard on our consolidated financial statements, we expect that upon adoption we will recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities and that the amounts could be material.\nStock Compensation\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Stock Compensation Expense. The new standard is primarily focused on income taxes and the presentation of taxes related to stock compensation, but also provides a simpler method of accounting for forfeitures. An entity will now be able to make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited, as permissible under existing GAAP, or account for forfeitures as incurred. The purpose of this ASU was to reduce cost and complexity of the accounting related to share-based payment awards issued to employees for public and private companies.\nASU No. 2016-09 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and early adoption upon issuance of the ASU is permitted. We have adopted this new ASU effective January 1, 2016. As part of the adoption, we have made an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as incurred rather than estimate the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited. The following summary provides further clarification of the transition approaches and the impact on the Company for each issue in ASU No. 2016-09 that requires a retrospective or modified retrospective approach:\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>For entities electing to account for forfeitures as they are incurred, a modified retrospective transition approach, with a cumulative-effect adjustment recognized in equity, is required for stock based compensation accounted for prior to the date on which the standard is adopted. We made the policy election to account for forfeitures as incurred and therefore, recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment in equity to account for this change in the first quarter of 2016. The overall impact to our consolidated financial statements is immaterial. Future forfeitures will be accounted for as they are incurred rather than estimating the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited at the time of grant.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A retrospective transition approach is required for classification of employee taxes paid in the Statement of Cash Flows when an employer withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes. In the three months ended March 31, 2015, shares were withheld for tax-withholding purposes related to the payment of vested 2011 LTIP awards. Previously, the withholdings were classified as an operating activity within our Statement of Cash Flows. We have retrospectively reclassified those withholdings as a financing activity and the total reclassification was $3.8 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>There was no additional impact on our financial statements, resulting from the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, that required a retrospective or modified retrospective approach. Any additional requirements under this ASU will be accounted for on a prospective basis.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Goodwill\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. The new standard simplifies how an entity tests for goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Step 2 measured a goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. By eliminating Step 2 an entity must now record an impairment to goodwill based on an analysis of the fair value of a reporting unit as compared to its carrying amount. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's fair value.\nASU No. 2017-04 will be effective for fiscal years beginning on January 1, 2020. including interim periods within those fiscal years, and early adoption as of January 1, 2017 is permitted. All changes are to be accounted for on a prospective basis upon adoption. We continue to evaluate the impact ASU No. 2017-04 will have on our consolidated financial statements. We have not yet determined whether we will early adopt ASU No. 2017-04.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use a non-GAAP financial measure as a key element in determining performance for purposes of incentive compensation under our annual Short-Term Incentive Plan (\"STIP\") and LTIP. That non-GAAP financial measure is operating cash flow ( OCF\u201d), defined as EBITDA less purchases of property and equipment. (The Company defines EBITDA as operating income plus depreciation, amortization and accretion, each determined in accordance with GAAP). Purchases of property and equipment are also determined in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of STIP and LTIP performance, OCF was as follows for the periods stated:\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus (Less): Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>8,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(53,948\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus (Less): Other expense (income)\n</td> <td>(543\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,182\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>368\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus (Less): Interest expense (income)\n</td> <td>(275\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>456\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>22,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Depreciation, amortization and accretion\n</td> <td>12,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA (as defined by the Company)\n</td> <td>35,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Purchases of property and equipment\n</td> <td>(6,256\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,374\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,679\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OCF (as defined by the Company)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,696\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I am unable to complete your request because I am unable to identify the table you are referring to.\n- Could you please provide me with the table name or a description of the table so I can better assist you? \n\nUnfortunately, without a table name or description, I cannot complete your request to delete specific rows from a table.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND STATEMENT OF INCOME\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and the discussion under Application of Critical Accounting Policies\u201d (also under Item 7), which describes key estimates and assumptions we make in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements; the cautionary language that appears under the title \"Forward Looking Statements\" immediately following the Table of Contents; Item 1. Business,\u201d which describes our operations; and Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d which describes key risks associated with our operations and markets in which we operate. A reference to a Note\u201d in this section refers to the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOverview and Highlights\nWe are a comprehensive provider of critical communication solutions for enterprises. We offer a suite of unified critical communication solutions that include call center operations, clinical alerting and notifications, one-way and advanced two-way wireless messaging services, mobile communications and public safety response. Our customers rely on Spok for workflow improvement, secure texting, paging services, contact center optimization and public safety response. Our product offerings are capable of addressing a customer's mission critical communications needs. We develop, sell and support enterprise-wide systems for healthcare and other organizations needing to automate, centralize and standardize their approach to critical communications. Our solutions can be found in prominent hospitals; large government agencies; leading public safety institutions, colleges and universities; large hotels, resorts and casinos; and well-known manufacturers. Our primary market has been the healthcare industry, particularly hospitals. We have identified hospitals with 200 or more beds as the primary targets for our software and wireless solutions.\nRevenue generated by wireless messaging services (including voice mail, personalized greeting, message storage and retrieval) and equipment loss and/or maintenance protection to both one-way and two-way messaging subscribers is presented as wireless revenue in our statements of income. Revenue generated by the sale of our software solutions, which includes software license, professional services (installation, consulting and training), equipment procured by us from third parties (to be used in conjunction with our software) and post-contract support (on-going maintenance), is presented as software revenue in our statements of income. Our software is licensed to end users under an industry standard software license agreement.\nThe following tables present wireless and software revenue by key market segments for the periods stated and illustrate the relative significance of these market segments to our operations.\n\n (1) Other includes hospitality, resort, indirect and billable travel revenue.  2016 Highlights\nNet sales declined by 5.3% or $10.1 million during 2016 compared to 2015, driven primarily by a continued and expected decline in wireless revenue while software revenue decreased slightly for the same period. Our operating expenses declined by 4.3% or $7.1 million during 2016 compared to 2015, driven primarily by reduction in all functional categories partially offset by an increase in research and development expenses attributable to our continued investment in the development of Spok Care Connect. We are committed to increasing our research and development spend throughout 2017 as we look to continue developing new products and services as well as enhancements for our current suite of solutions. We returned approximately $22.0 million of capital to our stockholders in the form of cash dividends and share repurchases which includes the special dividend declared in December 2016 but was paid in January 2017.\n2015 Highlights\nNet sales declined by 5.3% or $10.6 million during 2015 compared to 2014, driven primarily by a continued and expected decline in wireless revenue partially offset by solid growth in software maintenance revenue. Year-over-year paging unit erosion improved to a low of 6.6% during 2015 which was a decrease of 2.1% compared to 2014. Operating expenses declined by 4.4% or $7.6 million during 2015 compared to 2014, driven primarily by a reduction in general and administrative as well as lower depreciation, amortization and accretion costs. We reduced our deferred income tax asset valuation allowance by $64.2 million based on our analysis and expectation that these assets would now be realized in the future prior to expiration. We returned approximately $29.0 million of capital to our stockholders in the form of cash dividends and share repurchases.\nWireless Revenue\nOur core offering includes subscriptions to one-way or two-way messaging services for a periodic (monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or annual) service fee. This is generally based upon the type of service provided, the geographic area covered, the number of devices provided to the customer and the period of commitment. A subscriber to one-way messaging services may select coverage on a local, regional or nationwide basis to best meet their messaging needs. Two-way messaging is generally offered on a nationwide basis. In addition, subscribers either contract for a messaging device from us for an additional fixed monthly fee or they own a device, having purchased it either from us or from another vendor. We also sell devices to resellers who lease or resell devices to their subscribers and then sell messaging services utilizing our networks. We offer ancillary services, such as voicemail and equipment loss or maintenance protection, which help increase the monthly recurring revenue we receive along with these traditional messaging services. In 2015 and 2016 we launched new and exclusive one-way (T5) and two-way (T52) alphanumeric pagers, respectively. Both pagers are configurable to support un-encrypted or encrypted operation. When configured for encryption, they utilize AES-128 bit encryption, screen locking and remote wipe capabilities. With encryption enabled these new secure paging devices enhance our service offerings to the healthcare community by adding Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\"HIPAA\") security capabilities to the low cost, highly reliable and availability benefits of paging. (See Item 1. Business\u201d for more details.)\nSoftware Revenue\nSoftware revenue consists of two primary components: operations revenue and maintenance revenue. Operations revenue consists of license revenue, professional services revenue, and equipment revenue. Maintenance revenue is for ongoing support of a software application or equipment (typically for one year). We recognize equipment revenue when it is shipped or delivered to the customer depending on the delivery method of Free on Board (\"FOB\") shipping or FOB destination, respectively. License, professional services and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the longer of the period of professional services delivery to the customer or the contractual term of the maintenance agreement. If the period of delivery to the customer is not known, license and professional services revenue will be recognized when software and professional services are fully delivered to the customer and the maintenance revenue will be recognized ratably over the remaining contractual term of the agreement.\nOperations - Consolidated\nOur operating expenses are presented in functional categories. Certain of our functional categories are especially important to overall expense control and management. These operating expenses are categorized as follows:\n \u2022 Cost of revenue. These are expenses primarily for hardware, third-party software, outside service expenses and payroll and related expenses for our professional services, logistics, customer support and maintenance staff. \n \u2022 Research and Development. These expenses relate primarily to the development of new software products and the ongoing maintenance and enhancement of existing products. This classification consists primarily of employee payroll and related expenses, outside services related to the design, development, testing and enhancement of our solutions and to a lesser extent hardware equipment. \n \u2022 Service, rental and maintenance. These are expenses associated with the operation of our paging networks. Expenses consist largely of site rent expenses for transmitter locations, telecommunication expenses to deliver messages over our paging networks, and payroll and related expenses for our engineering and pager repair functions. \n \u2022 Selling and marketing. The sales and marketing staff are involved in selling our communication solutions primarily in the United States. These expenses support our efforts to maintain gross placements of units in service, which mitigated the impact of disconnects on our wireless revenue base, and to identify business opportunities for additional or future software sales. We have a centralized marketing function, which is focused on supporting our products and vertical sales efforts by strengthening our brand, generating sales leads and facilitating the sales process. These marketing functions are accomplished through targeted email campaigns, webinars, regional and national user conferences, monthly newsletters and participation at industry trade shows. Expenses consist largely of payroll and related expenses, commissions and other costs such as travel and advertising costs. \n \u2022 General and administrative. These are expenses associated with information technology and administrative functions. This classification consists primarily of payroll and related expenses, outside service expenses, taxes, licenses and permit expenses, and facility rent expenses.  We review the percentages of these operating expenses to revenue on a regular basis. Even though the operating expenses are classified as described above, expense control and management are also performed by expense category. Approximately 65.6%, 62.5% and 60.6% of the operating expenses referred to above were incurred in payroll and related expenses, site and facility rent expenses and telecommunication expenses for each the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nOur largest expense, payroll and related expenses, includes wages, commissions, incentives, employee benefits and related taxes. On a monthly basis, we review the number of employees in major functional categories and the design and physical locations of functional groups to continuously improve efficiency, to simplify organizational structures, and to minimize the number of physical locations for the Company. We had 587 full-time equivalent employees ( FTEs\u201d) at December 31, 2016, a decrease of 2.2% from 600 FTEs at December 31, 2015. We very recently announced plans to hire up to 60 new employees over the next 18 to 24 months, with the majority of new hires to occur during 2017. Nearly all of the new hires will be working in software development and supporting areas for our planned integrated communications platform, Spok Care Connect.\nWe operate local, regional, and nationwide one-way and two-way paging networks. These networks each require locations on which to place transmitters, receivers, and antennae. Site rent expenses for transmitter locations are highly dependent on the number of transmitters, which in turn is dependent on the number of networks. In addition, these expenses generally do not vary directly with the number of subscribers or units in service, which is detrimental to our operating margins as revenue declines. In order to reduce these expenses, we have an active program to consolidate the number of paging networks, and thus transmitter locations, which we refer to as network rationalization. We have reduced the number of active transmitters by 2.0% to 4,159 active transmitters at December 31, 2016 from 4,243 active transmitters at December 31, 2015.\nTelecommunication expenses are incurred to interconnect our paging networks and to provide telephone numbers for customer use, points of contact for customer service, and connectivity among our offices. These expenses are dependent on the number of units in service, the number of customers we support and the number of office and network locations that we maintain. However, the number or duration of telephone calls to call centers may vary from period to period based on factors other than the number of units in service or customers, which could cause telecommunication expenses to vary.\nStatements of Income\nComparison of Statement of Income Elements for the Years Ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014\n\nRevenue - Wireless\nThe table below details total wireless revenue for the periods stated:\n\nThe decrease in wireless revenue during 2016 compared to both 2015 and 2014, respectively, reflects the decrease in demand for our wireless services. Paging revenue consists primarily of recurring fees associated with the provision of messaging services and fees for paging devices and is net of a provision for service credits. Product and other revenue reflects system sales, the sale of devices and charges for paging devices that are not returned and are net of anticipated credits.\nThe demand for one-way and two-way messaging declined at each specified date and we believe demand will continue to decline for the foreseeable future. Demand for our services has also been impacted by the shift from narrow band wireless service offerings to broad band technology services by our competition.\nAs demand for one-way and two-way messaging has declined, we have developed or added service offerings such as encrypted paging and Spok Mobile with a pager number in order to increase our revenue potential and mitigate the decline in our wireless revenue. We will continue to explore ways to innovate and provide customers the highest value possible. Software revenue is anticipated to increase, while the wireless revenue is expected to continue to decrease reflecting the changing technology expectations of our customer base.\nWireless revenue is generally based upon the number of units in service and the monthly charge per unit. The number of units in service changes based on subscribers added, referred to as gross placements, less subscriber cancellations, or disconnects. The net of gross placements and disconnects is commonly referred to as net gains or losses of units in service or the net disconnect rate. The absolute number of gross placements as well as the number of gross placements relative to average units in service in a period, referred to as the gross placement rate, is monitored on a monthly basis. Disconnects are also monitored on a monthly basis. The ratio of units disconnected in a period to average units in service for the same period, called the disconnect rate, is an indicator of our success at retaining subscribers, which is important in order to maintain recurring revenue and to control operating expenses.\nThe following table sets forth information on our units in service by account size at specified dates:\n\n (1) All figures presented include both direct and indirect units in service.  The following table sets forth information on the net disconnect rate by account size for our customers for the periods stated:\n\n (1) All figures presented include both direct and indirect units in service.  The following table sets forth information on Average Revenue Per Unit (\"ARPU\") by account size for the periods stated:\n\n (1) All figures presented include both direct and indirect units in service.  While ARPU for similar services and distribution channels is indicative of changes in monthly charges and the revenue rate applicable to new subscribers, this measurement on a consolidated basis is affected by several factors, including the mix of units in service and the pricing of the various components of our services. We expect future annual revenue to decline in line with recent trends. The decrease in consolidated ARPU for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to the change in composition of our customer base as the percentage of units in service attributable to larger customers continues to increase. These larger customers benefit from lower pricing associated with their larger number of units-in-service. We believe that without further price adjustments, ARPU will trend lower in 2017. ARPU may further be affected by lower prices for broad band wireless services offered by our competitors. Any price increases could mitigate, but not completely offset, the expected declines in both ARPU and revenue.\nThe following reflects the impact of subscribers and ARPU on the change in wireless revenue:\n\n\nAs previously discussed, demand for messaging services has declined over the past several years and we anticipate that it will continue to decline for the foreseeable future, which would result in reductions in wireless revenue due to the decreased number of subscribers and related units in service.\nRevenue - Software\nThe table below details total revenue for software operations for the periods stated:\n\nThe decrease in software operations revenue during 2016 when compared to 2015 primarily reflects a decrease in the number and size of projects completed during 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. Starting in late 2015, we began a reorganization of the sales staff and related sales territories, which realigned territories and replaced lower performing sales employees with new staff. The decrease in operational bookings during 2015 and 2016 also factored into the decrease in operational revenue for the same period. The decrease in operations revenue during 2015 when compared to 2014 primarily reflects lower sales of software to new customers which was reflected in the decrease in license revenue.\nThe continued increase in maintenance revenue for each of the periods stated reflects our continuing success in renewals of our maintenance support for existing software solutions and in maintenance support for sales of new solutions. The maintenance renewal rates for the year ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were in excess of 99%. We achieve very high maintenance renewal rates compared to many companies that have software offerings, and we may experience a downward trend in maintenance renewal as communications technology and services continue to advance, and customers have more choices and opportunities to shift to newer solutions for their communication and work flow needs.\nOur software revenue is dependent on the conversion of our software bookings into revenues. On a regular basis, we enter into contractual arrangements with our customers to provide software licenses, professional services, and equipment sales. In addition, we enter into contractual arrangements for maintenance with our customers on new solutions or renewals of existing solutions. These contractual arrangements are reported as bookings and represent future revenue.\nThe following table summarizes total bookings for the periods stated:\n\nThe decrease in bookings during 2016 when compared to 2015 primarily reflects a decrease in the number of new operations orders and new maintenance orders from fewer new installations, partially offset by the continued success of maintenance and subscription renewals. Starting in late 2015, the Company undertook a reorganization of the sales staff and related sales territories. As part of that reorganization, the Company has replaced lower performing sales employees with new staff. The Company is unable to predict the impact of this reorganization on the level and timing of future software operations bookings. The Company is also migrating its sales focus from individual software solutions to its integrated solution portfolio. The change in sales focus has impacted bookings as the focus on the integrated solution portfolio requires a longer sales cycle to achieve completion. The maintenance bookings continue to reflect a strong renewal rate in excess of 99%.\nOperations and new orders in 2014 reflect $6.7 million of one-time bookings for a U.S. government entity which is the primary reason for the decrease in bookings during 2015 when compared to 2014. Excluding the one-time booking, operations and new maintenance orders remained relatively flat while maintenance and subscription renewals continued to reflect a strong renewal rate in excess of 99%.\nThe following table summarizes backlog for the periods stated:\n\n (1) Other reflects cancellations and adjustments to backlog. \nWe reported a software backlog of $38.3 million at December 31, 2016 which represented all orders received from customers not yet recognized as revenue. We continually review our backlog and adjust the balance to reflect the expected amount and timing of customer implementations. Refer to the discussion on revenue and bookings for explanations of the changes in backlog for the periods ending December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nOperating Expenses\n\nCost of revenue. Cost of revenue consisted primarily of the following items:\n\nAs illustrated in the table above, cost of revenue expense decreased $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and increased $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the following significant components and variances:\n \u2022 Payroll and related - Payroll and related expenses were incurred largely for maintenance, support and service personnel. While there was a decrease of 10 FTEs for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, payroll and related expenses increased by $1.0 million due primarily to the timing of hiring and departures and an increase in the average cost per employee. The increase of $1.4 million in payroll and related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compare to the same period in 2014 was due primarily to an increase of 12 FTEs and by an increase in the average cost per employee. \n \u2022 Cost of sales - Cost of sales consisted primarily of third party software, use of third party resources for software implementation related work, inventory and maintenance of third party products. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 cost of sales decreased by $3.2 million due primarily to a decrease in the sale of third party software, less use of third party resources for software implementation related work, a reduction in billable travel costs and a one-time charge of $0.8 million related to adjustments made to our inventory balances in 2015. The increase of $0.4 million in cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 was due primarily to charges related to missing or obsolete inventory in the second quarter of 2015, which was partially off-set by lower third-party professional services related to the implementation of software sales orders. \n \u2022 Stock based compensation - Stock based compensation expenses consisted primarily of amortization of compensation expense associated with restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) granted to certain eligible employees. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 stock based compensation expense decreased by $0.1 million due primarily to the reversal of stock compensation expense partially offset by the issuance and amortization of the 2016 grants under the 2015 LTIP. The decrease of $0.2 million in stock based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 compare to the same period in 2014 was due primarily to lower amortization of compensation expense for awards under the 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (\"LTIP\"). (See Note 7, \"Stockholders' Equity\"). \n \u2022 Other - Other expenses consisted primarily of repairs and maintenance, shipping, outside services and travel costs. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 other expenses decreased by $0.9 million due primarily to a reduction in outside services, shipping expenses, repairs and maintenance and travel costs. The decrease of $0.3 million in other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 was due primarily to a decrease in outside services, repairs and maintenance and travel costs. \nResearch and development. We intend to substantially increase our research and development efforts associated with our software solutions due to its importance to our continued success. The Company is investing in the development of products in the areas of: 1) mobility, 2) a unified software platform, 3) nursing solutions, and 4) alerting. The Company plans to continue to increase its staffing to develop its integrated communications solution portfolio. This increase in staffing will substantially impact margins and our cash flow from operations as the benefits from this development effort will not immediately be realized for at least three years. Based on this emphasis we expect the number of FTEs to increase in this area, substantially impacting future payroll and related expenses. Research and development consisted primarily of the following items:\n\nAs illustrated in the table above, research and development expense increased $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and increased $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the following significant components and variances:\n \u2022 Payroll and related - Payroll and related expenses were incurred largely for product development personnel. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 payroll and related expenses increased by $3.2 million due primarily to an increase of 28 FTEs and an increase in the average cost per employee. The increase of $0.7 million in payroll and related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compare to the same period in 2014 was due primarily to an increase of 7 FTEs and an increase in the average cost per employee. \n \u2022 Outside services - Outside services consisted primarily of third party developers. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 compared to the same period in 2015 and 2014 outside services remained relatively flat. \n \u2022 Stock based compensation - Stock based compensation expenses consisted primarily of amortization of compensation expense associated with RSUs granted to certain eligible employees. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 compared to the same period in 2015 and 2014 stock based compensation expense remained relatively flat. (See Note 7, \"Stockholders' Equity\"). \n \u2022 Other - Other expenses consisted primarily of travel and office expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 compared to the same period in 2015 and 2014 other expenses remained relatively flat. \nService, rental and maintenance. Service, rental and maintenance consisted primarily of the following items:\n\nAs illustrated in the table above, service, rental and maintenance expense decreased $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and decreased $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the following significant components and variances:\n \u2022 Payroll and related - Payroll and related expenses were incurred largely for field technicians, their managers, in-house repair personnel and quality assurance personnel. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 payroll and related expenses decreased by $0.2 million due primarily to a decrease of 1 FTE partially offset by an increase in the average cost per employee. The increase of $0.2 million in payroll and related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 was due primarily to a decrease of 1 FTE offset by an increase in the average cost per employee. \n \u2022 Site rent - Site rent expenses consisted primarily of rent for transmitter locations used in our paging network. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, site rent expenses decreased by $0.4 million and $0.8 million, respectively, due primarily to the rationalization of our networks, which has decreased the number of transmitters required to provide service to our customers. The reduction in transmitters has, in turn, reduced the number of lease locations. The number of active transmitters declined 2.0% from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 and 2.2% from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. \n \u2022 Telecommunications - Telecommunications expenses consisted primarily of expenses incurred to interconnect our paging networks and to provide telephone numbers for customer use, points of contact for customer service, and connectivity among our offices. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, telecommunications expenses decreased by $0.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively, due to the consolidation of our networks. We believe continued reductions in these expenses will occur as our networks continue to be consolidated for the foreseeable future. \n \u2022 Stock based compensation - Stock based compensation expenses consisted primarily of amortization of compensation expense associated with RSUs granted to certain eligible employees. For the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 compared to the same period in 2015 and 2014 stock based compensation expense remained relatively flat. (See Note 7, \"Stockholders' Equity\"). \n \u2022 Other - Other expenses consisted primarily of repairs and maintenance and outside services and includes management of these expenses to reflect the continued transition to support the growth in software revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 other expenses decreased by $0.1 million due primarily to repairs and maintenance. The decrease of $0.2 million in other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 was due primarily to a reclassification of expenses to other functional categories. \nSelling and marketing. Selling and marketing consisted primarily of the following items:\n\nAs illustrated in the table above, selling and marketing expense decreased $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and decreased $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the following significant components and variances:\n \u2022 Payroll and related - Payroll and related expenses were incurred largely for sales and marketing personnel. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 payroll and related expenses decreased by $0.8 million due primarily to a decrease of 23 FTEs, predominately related to the reorganization of our sales staff and related sales territories, partially offset by an increase in the average cost per employee. This decrease in FTEs reflects the reorganization of the sales staff, which includes the replacement of underperforming sales employees. While there was an increase of 6 FTEs for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, the average headcount outstanding for 2015 was lower by approximately 16 FTEs compared to the same period in 2014. The decrease of $0.9 million in payroll and related expenses in 2015 was due primarily to the lower average headcount, partially offset by an increase in the average cost per employee. \n \u2022 Commissions - Commissions expense relates to the payments made to the sales representatives responsible for executing contracts. Commissions are expensed as projects are implemented and are impacted by the level of software operations revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 commissions expense decreased by $1.6 million due primarily to lower software operations revenue compared to the same period in the prior year and to a lesser extent due to the continued impact from the change in the commission plan incentives made in 2015. The decrease of $1.2 million in commissions expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 was due primarily to the impact of a change in the commission plan incentives, which lowered the commission paid on the sale of certain products and to a lesser extent on lower software operations revenue in 2015. \n \u2022 Stock based compensation - Stock based compensation expenses consisted primarily of amortization of compensation expense associated with RSUs granted to certain eligible employees. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 stock based compensation expense remained relatively flat due primarily to the reversal of stock compensation expense partially offset by the issuance and amortization of the 2016 grants under the 2015 LTIP. The decrease of $0.4 million in stock based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 compare to the same period in 2014 was due primarily to lower amortization of compensation expense for awards under the 2015 LTIP. (See Note 7, \"Stockholders' Equity\"). \n \u2022 Other - Other expenses consisted primarily of advertising, trade show, convention and related travel expenses and reflect our focus on identifying sales opportunities. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 other expenses decreased by $0.2 million due primarily to customer referral fees and an aggregate of smaller insignificant costs partially offset by higher advertising expenses in 2015. Other expenses remained relatively consistent for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. \nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative consisted primarily of the following items:\n\nAs illustrated in the table above, general and administrative expense decreased $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and decreased $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the following significant components and variances:\n \u2022 Payroll and related - Payroll and related expenses were incurred for employees in information technology, administrative operations, finance, human resources and executive management. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 payroll and related expenses decreased by $0.5 million due primarily to a decrease of 7 FTEs partially offset by an increase in the average cost per employee. The decrease of $0.4 million in payroll and related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compare to the same period in 2014 was due primarily to a decrease of 11 FTEs partially offset by an increase in the average cost per employee. \n \u2022 Stock based compensation - Stock based compensation expenses consisted primarily of amortization of compensation expense associated with RSUs granted to certain eligible employees. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 stock based compensation expense decreased by $0.8 million due primarily to the reversal of stock compensation expense partially offset by the issuance and amortization of the 2016 grants under the 2015 LTIP. The decrease of $1.3 million in stock based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 compare to the same period in 2014 was due primarily to lower amortization of compensation expense for awards under the 2015 LTIP. (See Note 7, \"Stockholders' Equity\"). \n \u2022 Facility Rent- Facility rent expenses consisted primarily of rent, utilities and other fees related to the lease of office space for administrative purposes. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 facility rent expenses decreased by $0.2 million due primarily to reductions in rent and utilities. Facility rent expenses stayed relatively consistent for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. \n \u2022 Outside services - Outside service expenses consisted primarily of costs associated with professional services related to financial reporting, taxes and internal control compliance. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 outside service expenses increased by $0.8 million due primarily to costs related to the enhancement and replacement of certain internal processes and systems. These costs include enhancement of our current customer relationship management solution, implementation of an enterprise resource planning platform, replacement of our sales quoting tool and the addition of commission software. The increase of $0.2 million in outside service expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 was due primarily to higher professional service fees for external accounting and tax support services. \n \u2022 Taxes, licenses and permits - Taxes, license and permit expenses consisted primarily of property, franchise, gross receipts and transactional taxes and are primarily impacted by our level of revenue and property and equipment base. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, taxes, license and permit expenses decreased by $0.2 million due primarily to a decrease in gross receipts, license and permits and personal property tax partially offset by an increase in sales and use tax. The decrease of $0.5 million in taxes, license and permit expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 was due primarily to a decrease in gross receipts and sales and use tax partially offset by increases in license and permits expense. \n \u2022 Other - Other expenses consisted primarily of bad debt, insurance, shipping costs, financial services and office rent and utilities. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 other expenses increased by $0.1 million due primarily to an aggregate of smaller insignificant costs. The decrease of $1.8 million in other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 was due primarily to a non-recurring charge of $0.8 million related to future billing credits, relocation expenses and refunds and repairs and maintenance for the year ended December 31, 2014, which were not incurred in 2015. \nSeverance. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 severance expenses decreased by $1.3 million and increased by $1.2 million, respectively, due primarily to the departure of two executives during the year ended December 31, 2015 which were not incurred in 2016 or 2014 (See Note 1, \"Organization and Significant Accounting Policies\", for further discussion on our severance policies).\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses decreased by $1.0 million due primarily to $0.6 million related to the amortization of our acquired technology and non-compete arrangements which were included for the year ended December 31, 2015 but were completely amortized during the year ended December 31, 2016 and $0.5 million related to lower depreciation expense because of a lower balance of pagers for the year ended December 31, 2016 partially offset by $0.1 million in other changes. The decrease of $2.7 million in depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 was due primarily to $1.6 million in lower depreciation expense for the period for non-paging device assets and $1.0 million in lower amortization expense for intangible assets associated with the change in the useful life of software related intangibles due to our rebranding in 2014 and $0.1 million in other changes.\nInterest expense, net, Other income, net and Income tax expense\nInterest income (expense), net. For the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, interest income increased by $0.3 million primarily due to an increase in funds held in interest bearing accounts.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

Revenue generated by the sale of our software solutions, which includes software license, professional services (installation, consulting and training), equipment procured by us from third parties (to be used in conjunction with our software) and post-contract support (on-going maintenance), is presented as software revenue in our statements of income. Our software is licensed to end users under an industry standard software license agreement.\nThe following tables present wireless and software revenue by key market segments for the periods stated and illustrate the relative significance of these market segments to our operations.\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Wireless\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Software\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Wireless\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Software\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Wireless\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Software\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nTotal\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Healthcare\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>126,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>129,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Government\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Large Enterprise\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>179,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>200,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Other includes hospitality, resort, indirect and billable travel revenue.  2016 Highlights\nNet sales declined by 5.3% or $10.1 million during 2016 compared to 2015, driven primarily by a continued and expected decline in wireless revenue while software revenue decreased slightly for the same period. Our operating expenses declined by 4.3% or $7.1 million during 2016 compared to 2015, driven primarily by reduction in all functional categories partially offset by an increase in research and development expenses attributable to our continued investment in the development of Spok Care Connect. We are committed to increasing our research and development spend throughout 2017 as we look to continue developing new products and services as well as enhancements for our current suite of solutions. We returned approximately $22.0 million of capital to our stockholders in the form of cash dividends and share repurchases which includes the special dividend declared in December 2016 but was paid in January 2017.\n2015 Highlights\nNet sales declined by 5.3% or $10.6 million during 2015 compared to 2014, driven primarily by a continued and expected decline in wireless revenue partially offset by solid growth in software maintenance revenue. Year-over-year paging unit erosion improved to a low of 6.6% during 2015 which was a decrease of 2.1% compared to 2014. Operating expenses declined by 4.4% or $7.6 million during 2015 compared to 2014, driven primarily by a reduction in general and administrative as well as lower depreciation, amortization and accretion costs. We reduced our deferred income tax asset valuation allowance by $64.2 million based on our analysis and expectation that these assets would now be realized in the future prior to expiration. We returned approximately $29.0 million of capital to our stockholders in the form of cash dividends and share repurchases.\nWireless Revenue\nOur core offering includes subscriptions to one-way or two-way messaging services for a periodic (monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or annual) service fee. This is generally based upon the type of service provided, the geographic area covered, the number of devices provided to the customer and the period of commitment. A subscriber to one-way messaging services may select coverage on a local, regional or nationwide basis to best meet their messaging needs. Two-way messaging is generally offered on a nationwide basis. In addition, subscribers either contract for a messaging device from us for an additional fixed monthly fee or they own a device, having purchased it either from us or from another vendor. We also sell devices to resellers who lease or resell devices to their subscribers and then sell messaging services utilizing our networks. We offer ancillary services, such as voicemail and equipment loss or maintenance protection, which help increase the monthly recurring revenue we receive along with these traditional messaging services. In 2015 and 2016 we launched new and exclusive one-way (T5) and two-way (T52) alphanumeric pagers, respectively. Both pagers are configurable to support un-encrypted or encrypted operation. When configured for encryption, they utilize AES-128 bit encryption, screen locking and remote wipe capabilities. With encryption enabled these new secure paging devices enhance our service offerings to the healthcare community by adding Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\"HIPAA\") security capabilities to the low cost, highly reliable and availability benefits of paging. (See Item 1. Business\u201d for more details.)\nSoftware Revenue\nSoftware revenue consists of two primary components: operations revenue and maintenance revenue. Operations revenue consists of license revenue, professional services revenue, and equipment revenue. Maintenance revenue is for ongoing support of a software application or equipment (typically for one year). We recognize equipment revenue when it is shipped or delivered to the customer depending on the delivery method of Free on Board (\"FOB\") shipping or FOB destination, respectively. License, professional services and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the longer of the period of professional services delivery to the customer or the contractual term of the maintenance agreement. If the period of delivery to the customer is not known, license and professional services revenue will be recognized when software and professional services are fully delivered to the customer and the maintenance revenue will be recognized ratably over the remaining contractual term of the agreement.\nOperations - Consolidated\nOur operating expenses are presented in functional categories. Certain of our functional categories are especially important to overall expense control and management. These operating expenses are categorized as follows:\n \u2022 Cost of revenue. These are expenses primarily for hardware, third-party software, outside service expenses and payroll and related expenses for our professional services, logistics, customer support and maintenance staff. \n \u2022 Research and Development. These expenses relate primarily to the development of new software products and the ongoing maintenance and enhancement of existing products. This classification consists primarily of employee payroll and related expenses, outside services related to the design, development, testing and enhancement of our solutions and to a lesser extent hardware equipment. \n \u2022 Service, rental and maintenance. These are expenses associated with the operation of our paging networks. Expenses consist largely of site rent expenses for transmitter locations, telecommunication expenses to deliver messages over our paging networks, and payroll and related expenses for our engineering and pager repair functions. \n \u2022 Selling and marketing. The sales and marketing staff are involved in selling our communication solutions primarily in the United States. These expenses support our efforts to maintain gross placements of units in service, which mitigated the impact of disconnects on our wireless revenue base, and to identify business opportunities for additional or future software sales. We have a centralized marketing function, which is focused on supporting our products and vertical sales efforts by strengthening our brand, generating sales leads and facilitating the sales process. These marketing functions are accomplished through targeted email campaigns, webinars, regional and national user conferences, monthly newsletters and participation at industry trade shows. Expenses consist largely of payroll and related expenses, commissions and other costs such as travel and advertising costs. \n \u2022 General and administrative. These are expenses associated with information technology and administrative functions. This classification consists primarily of payroll and related expenses, outside service expenses, taxes, licenses and permit expenses, and facility rent expenses.  We review the percentages of these operating expenses to revenue on a regular basis. Even though the operating expenses are classified as described above, expense control and management are also performed by expense category. Approximately 65.6%, 62.5% and 60.6% of the operating expenses referred to above were incurred in payroll and related expenses, site and facility rent expenses and telecommunication expenses for each the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nOur largest expense, payroll and related expenses, includes wages, commissions, incentives, employee benefits and related taxes. On a monthly basis, we review the number of employees in major functional categories and the design and physical locations of functional groups to continuously improve efficiency, to simplify organizational structures, and to minimize the number of physical locations for the Company. We had 587 full-time equivalent employees ( FTEs\u201d) at December 31, 2016, a decrease of 2.2% from 600 FTEs at December 31, 2015. We very recently announced plans to hire up to 60 new employees over the next 18 to 24 months, with the majority of new hires to occur during 2017. Nearly all of the new hires will be working in software development and supporting areas for our planned integrated communications platform, Spok Care Connect.\nWe operate local, regional, and nationwide one-way and two-way paging networks. These networks each require locations on which to place transmitters, receivers, and antennae. Site rent expenses for transmitter locations are highly dependent on the number of transmitters, which in turn is dependent on the number of networks. In addition, these expenses generally do not vary directly with the number of subscribers or units in service, which is detrimental to our operating margins as revenue declines. In order to reduce these expenses, we have an active program to consolidate the number of paging networks, and thus transmitter locations, which we refer to as network rationalization. We have reduced the number of active transmitters by 2.0% to 4,159 active transmitters at December 31, 2016 from 4,243 active transmitters at December 31, 2015.\nTelecommunication expenses are incurred to interconnect our paging networks and to provide telephone numbers for customer use, points of contact for customer service, and connectivity among our offices. These expenses are dependent on the number of units in service, the number of customers we support and the number of office and network locations that we maintain. However, the number or duration of telephone calls to call centers may vary from period to period based on factors other than the number of units in service or customers, which could cause telecommunication expenses to vary.\nStatements of Income\nComparison of Statement of Income Elements for the Years Ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td>

respectively, reflects the decrease in demand for our wireless services. Paging revenue consists primarily of recurring fees associated with the provision of messaging services and fees for paging devices and is net of a provision for service credits. Product and other revenue reflects system sales, the sale of devices and charges for paging devices that are not returned and are net of anticipated credits.\nThe demand for one-way and two-way messaging declined at each specified date and we believe demand will continue to decline for the foreseeable future. Demand for our services has also been impacted by the shift from narrow band wireless service offerings to broad band technology services by our competition.\nAs demand for one-way and two-way messaging has declined, we have developed or added service offerings such as encrypted paging and Spok Mobile with a pager number in order to increase our revenue potential and mitigate the decline in our wireless revenue. We will continue to explore ways to innovate and provide customers the highest value possible. Software revenue is anticipated to increase, while the wireless revenue is expected to continue to decrease reflecting the changing technology expectations of our customer base.\nWireless revenue is generally based upon the number of units in service and the monthly charge per unit. The number of units in service changes based on subscribers added, referred to as gross placements, less subscriber cancellations, or disconnects. The net of gross placements and disconnects is commonly referred to as net gains or losses of units in service or the net disconnect rate. The absolute number of gross placements as well as the number of gross placements relative to average units in service in a period, referred to as the gross placement rate, is monitored on a monthly basis. Disconnects are also monitored on a monthly basis. The ratio of units disconnected in a period to average units in service for the same period, called the disconnect rate, is an indicator of our success at retaining subscribers, which is important in order to maintain recurring revenue and to control operating expenses.\nThe following table sets forth information on our units in service by account size at specified dates:\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Account Size\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Units in thousands)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1 to 100 Units(1)\n</td> <td>105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>101 to 1000 Units(1)\n</td> <td>217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>> 1000 Units(1)\n</td> <td>789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total units in service(1)\n</td> <td>1,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) All figures presented include both direct and indirect units in service.

While ARPU for similar services and distribution channels is indicative of changes in monthly charges and the revenue rate applicable to new subscribers, this measurement on a consolidated basis is affected by several factors, including the mix of units in service and the pricing of the various components of our services. We expect future annual revenue to decline in line with recent trends. The decrease in consolidated ARPU for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to the change in composition of our customer base as the percentage of units in service attributable to larger customers continues to increase. These larger customers benefit from lower pricing associated with their larger number of units-in-service. We believe that without further price adjustments, ARPU will trend lower in 2017. ARPU may further be affected by lower prices for broad band wireless services offered by our competitors. Any price increases could mitigate, but not completely offset, the expected declines in both ARPU and revenue.\nThe following reflects the impact of subscribers and ARPU on the change in wireless revenue:\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Units in Service As of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Revenue For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change Due To:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>ARPU\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Units\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Units in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>1,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(62\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,059\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,886\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,173\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Units in Service as of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Revenue For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change Due To:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>ARPU\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Units\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Units in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>1,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(83\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>125,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11,094\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,236\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,858\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs previously discussed, demand for messaging services has declined over the past several years and we anticipate that it will continue to decline for the foreseeable future, which would result in reductions in wireless revenue due to the decreased number of subscribers and related units in service.\nRevenue -

Starting in late 2015, we began a reorganization of the sales staff and related sales territories, which realigned territories and replaced lower performing sales employees with new staff. The decrease in operational bookings during 2015 and 2016 also factored into the decrease in operational revenue for the same period. The decrease in operations revenue during 2015 when compared to 2014 primarily reflects lower sales of software to new customers which was reflected in the decrease in license revenue.\nThe continued increase in maintenance revenue for each of the periods stated reflects our continuing success in renewals of our maintenance support for existing software solutions and in maintenance support for sales of new solutions. The maintenance renewal rates for the year ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were in excess of 99%. We achieve very high maintenance renewal rates compared to many companies that have software offerings, and we may experience a downward trend in maintenance renewal as communications technology and services continue to advance, and customers have more choices and opportunities to shift to newer solutions for their communication and work flow needs.\nOur software revenue is dependent on the conversion of our software bookings into revenues. On a regular basis, we enter into contractual arrangements with our customers to provide software licenses, professional services, and equipment sales. In addition, we enter into contractual arrangements for maintenance with our customers on new solutions or renewals of existing solutions. These contractual arrangements are reported as bookings and represent future revenue.\nThe following table summarizes total bookings for the periods stated:\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bookings\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operations and new maintenance orders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,979\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,548\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance and subscription renewals\n</td> <td>40,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total bookings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(169\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,491\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in bookings during 2016 when compared to 2015 primarily reflects a decrease in the number of new operations orders and new maintenance orders from fewer new installations, partially offset by the continued success of maintenance and subscription renewals. Starting in late 2015, the Company undertook a reorganization of the sales staff and related sales territories. As part of that reorganization, the Company has replaced lower performing sales employees with new staff. The Company is unable to predict the impact of this reorganization on the level and timing of future software operations bookings. The Company is also migrating its sales focus from individual software solutions to its integrated solution portfolio. The change in sales focus has impacted bookings as the focus on the integrated solution portfolio requires a longer sales cycle to achieve completion. The maintenance bookings continue to reflect a strong renewal rate in excess of 99%.\nOperations and new orders in 2014 reflect $6.7 million of one-time bookings for a U.S. government entity which is the primary reason for the decrease in bookings during 2015 when compared to 2014.

While there was a decrease of 10 FTEs for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, payroll and related expenses increased by $1.0 million due primarily to the timing of hiring and departures and an increase in the average cost per employee. The increase of $1.4 million in payroll and related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compare to the same period in 2014 was due primarily to an increase of 12 FTEs and by an increase in the average cost per employee. \n \u2022 Cost of sales - Cost of sales consisted primarily of third party software, use of third party resources for software implementation related work, inventory and maintenance of third party products. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 cost of sales decreased by $3.2 million due primarily to a decrease in the sale of third party software, less use of third party resources for software implementation related work, a reduction in billable travel costs and a one-time charge of $0.8 million related to adjustments made to our inventory balances in 2015. The increase of $0.4 million in cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 was due primarily to charges related to missing or obsolete inventory in the second quarter of 2015, which was partially off-set by lower third-party professional services related to the implementation of software sales orders. \n \u2022 Stock based compensation - Stock based compensation expenses consisted primarily of amortization of compensation expense associated with restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) granted to certain eligible employees. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 stock based compensation expense decreased by $0.1 million due primarily to the reversal of stock compensation expense partially offset by the issuance and amortization of the 2016 grants under the 2015 LTIP. The decrease of $0.2 million in stock based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 compare to the same period in 2014 was due primarily to lower amortization of compensation expense for awards under the 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (\"LTIP\"). (See Note 7, \"Stockholders' Equity\"). \n \u2022 Other - Other expenses consisted primarily of repairs and maintenance, shipping, outside services and travel costs. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 other expenses decreased by $0.9 million due primarily to a reduction in outside services, shipping expenses, repairs and maintenance and travel costs. The decrease of $0.3 million in other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 was due primarily to a decrease in outside services, repairs and maintenance and travel costs. \nResearch and development. We intend to substantially increase our research and development efforts associated with our software solutions due to its importance to our continued success. The Company is investing in the development of products in the areas of: 1) mobility, 2) a unified software platform, 3) nursing solutions, and 4) alerting. The Company plans to continue to increase its staffing to develop its integrated communications solution portfolio. This increase in staffing will substantially impact margins and our cash flow from operations as the benefits from this development effort will not immediately be realized for at least three years. Based on this emphasis we expect the number of FTEs to increase in this area, substantially impacting future payroll and related expenses.

For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, site rent expenses decreased by $0.4 million and $0.8 million, respectively, due primarily to the rationalization of our networks, which has decreased the number of transmitters required to provide service to our customers. The reduction in transmitters has, in turn, reduced the number of lease locations. The number of active transmitters declined 2.0% from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 and 2.2% from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. \n \u2022 Telecommunications - Telecommunications expenses consisted primarily of expenses incurred to interconnect our paging networks and to provide telephone numbers for customer use, points of contact for customer service, and connectivity among our offices. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, telecommunications expenses decreased by $0.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively, due to the consolidation of our networks. We believe continued reductions in these expenses will occur as our networks continue to be consolidated for the foreseeable future. \n \u2022 Stock based compensation - Stock based compensation expenses consisted primarily of amortization of compensation expense associated with RSUs granted to certain eligible employees. For the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 compared to the same period in 2015 and 2014 stock based compensation expense remained relatively flat. (See Note 7, \"Stockholders' Equity\"). \n \u2022 Other - Other expenses consisted primarily of repairs and maintenance and outside services and includes management of these expenses to reflect the continued transition to support the growth in software revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 other expenses decreased by $0.1 million due primarily to repairs and maintenance. The decrease of $0.2 million in other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 was due primarily to a reclassification of expenses to other functional categories. \nSelling and marketing. Selling and marketing consisted primarily of the following items:\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and marketing\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payroll and related\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(841\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(908\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commissions\n</td> <td>5,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,590\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,230\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock based compensation\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(44\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(39.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(433\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(79.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>544\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>4,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(203\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total selling and marketing\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,678\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,567\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FTEs\n</td> <td>107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs illustrated in the table above, selling and marketing expense decreased $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and decreased $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the following significant components and variances:\n \u2022 Payroll and related - Payroll and related expenses were incurred largely for sales and marketing personnel. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 payroll and related expenses decreased by $0.8 million due primarily to a decrease of 23 FTEs, predominately related to the reorganization of our sales staff and related sales territories, partially offset by an increase in the average cost per employee. This decrease in FTEs reflects the reorganization of the sales staff, which includes the replacement of underperforming sales employees. While there was an increase of 6 FTEs for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, the average headcount outstanding for 2015 was lower by approximately 16 FTEs compared to the same period in 2014. The decrease of $0.9 million in payroll and related expenses in 2015 was due primarily to the lower average headcount, partially offset by an increase in the average cost per employee. \n \u2022 Commissions - Commissions expense relates to the payments made to the sales representatives responsible for executing contracts. Commissions are expensed as projects are implemented and are impacted by the level of software operations revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 commissions expense decreased by $1.6 million due primarily to lower software operations revenue compared to the same period in the prior year and to a lesser extent due to the continued impact from the change in the commission plan incentives made in 2015. The decrease of $1.2 million in commissions expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 was due primarily to the impact of a change in the commission plan incentives, which lowered the commission paid on the sale of certain products and to a lesser extent on lower software operations revenue in 2015. \n \u2022 Stock based compensation - Stock based compensation expenses consisted primarily of amortization of compensation expense associated with RSUs granted to certain eligible employees. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 stock based compensation expense remained relatively flat due primarily to the reversal of stock compensation expense partially offset by the issuance and amortization of the 2016 grants under the 2015 LTIP. The decrease of $0.4 million in stock based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 compare to the same period in 2014 was due primarily to lower amortization of compensation expense for awards under the 2015 LTIP. (See Note 7, \"Stockholders' Equity\"). \n \u2022 Other - Other expenses consisted primarily of advertising, trade show, convention and related travel expenses and reflect our focus on identifying sales opportunities. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 other expenses decreased by $0.2 million due primarily to customer referral fees and an aggregate of smaller insignificant costs partially offset by higher advertising expenses in 2015. Other expenses remained relatively consistent for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. \nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative consisted primarily of the following items:\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payroll and related\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(458\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(350\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock based compensation\n</td> <td>666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(842\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(55.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,327\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(46.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Facility rent\n</td> <td>3,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(190\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outside services\n</td> <td>8,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Taxes, licenses and permits\n</td> <td>4,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(222\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(479\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>7,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,768\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total general and administrative\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(778\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,737\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FTEs\n</td> <td>114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs illustrated in the table above, general and administrative expense decreased $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and decreased $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the following significant components and variances:\n \u2022 Payroll and related - Payroll and related expenses were incurred for employees in information technology, administrative operations, finance, human resources and executive management. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 payroll and related expenses decreased by $0.5 million due primarily to a decrease of 7 FTEs partially offset by an increase in the average cost per employee. The decrease of $0.4 million in payroll and related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compare to the same period in 2014 was due primarily to a decrease of 11 FTEs partially offset by an increase in the average cost per employee. \n \u2022 Stock based compensation - Stock based compensation expenses consisted primarily of amortization of compensation expense associated with RSUs granted to certain eligible employees. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 stock based compensation expense decreased by $0.8 million due primarily to the reversal of stock compensation expense partially offset by the issuance and amortization of the 2016 grants under the 2015 LTIP. The decrease of $1.3 million in stock based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 compare to the same period in 2014 was due primarily to lower amortization of compensation expense for awards under the 2015 LTIP. (See Note 7, \"Stockholders' Equity\"). \n \u2022 Facility Rent- Facility rent expenses consisted primarily of rent, utilities and other fees related to the lease of office space for administrative purposes. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 facility rent expenses decreased by $0.2 million due primarily to reductions in rent and utilities. Facility rent expenses stayed relatively consistent for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. \n \u2022 Outside services - Outside service expenses consisted primarily of costs associated with professional services related to financial reporting, taxes and internal control compliance. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 outside service expenses increased by $0.8 million due primarily to costs related to the enhancement and replacement of certain internal processes and systems. These costs include enhancement of our current customer relationship management solution, implementation of an enterprise resource planning platform, replacement of our sales quoting tool and the addition of commission software. The increase of $0.2 million in outside service expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 was due primarily to higher professional service fees for external accounting and tax support services. \n \u2022 Taxes, licenses and permits - Taxes, license and permit expenses consisted primarily of property, franchise, gross receipts and transactional taxes and are primarily impacted by our level of revenue and property and equipment base. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, taxes, license and permit expenses decreased by $0.2 million due primarily to a decrease in gross receipts, license and permits and personal property tax partially offset by an increase in sales and use tax.

For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 severance expenses decreased by $1.3 million and increased by $1.2 million, respectively, due primarily to the departure of two executives during the year ended December 31, 2015 which were not incurred in 2016 or 2014 (See Note 1, \"Organization and Significant Accounting Policies\", for further discussion on our severance policies).\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses decreased by $1.0 million due primarily to $0.6 million related to the amortization of our acquired technology and non-compete arrangements which were included for the year ended December 31, 2015 but were completely amortized during the year ended December 31, 2016 and $0.5 million related to lower depreciation expense because of a lower balance of pagers for the year ended December 31, 2016 partially offset by $0.1 million in other changes.
