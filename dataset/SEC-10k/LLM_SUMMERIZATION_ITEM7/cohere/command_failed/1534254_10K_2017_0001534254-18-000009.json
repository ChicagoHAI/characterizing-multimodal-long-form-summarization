Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, the following discussion and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties.\nOverview\nWe were incorporated under the general corporation laws of the State of Maryland on August 9, 2011 and commenced operations on December 17, 2012 upon raising proceeds of $2,500 from persons not affiliated with us, CIM or Apollo. We are an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a RIC, as defined under Subchapter M of the Code.\nOur investment objective is to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation for investors. Our portfolio is comprised primarily of investments in senior secured debt, including first lien loans, second lien loans and unitranche loans, and, to a lesser extent, collateralized securities, structured products and other similar securities, unsecured debt, including corporate bonds and long-term subordinated loans, referred to as mezzanine loans, and equity, of private and thinly-traded U.S. middle-market companies. In connection with our debt investments, we may receive equity interests such as warrants or options as additional consideration. We may also purchase minority interests in the form of common or preferred equity in our target companies, either in conjunction with one of our debt investments or through a co-investment with a financial sponsor.\nWe are managed by CIM, our affiliate and a registered investment adviser. CIM oversees the management of our activities and is responsible for making investment decisions for our portfolio. On November 1, 2017, our board of directors, including a majority of directors who are not interested persons, approved the renewal of the investment advisory agreement with CIM for a period of twelve months commencing December 17, 2017. We and CIM previously engaged AIM to act as our investment sub-adviser.\nOn July 11, 2017, the members of CIM entered into the Third CIM LLC Agreement for the purpose of creating a joint venture between AIM and CIG. Under the Third CIM LLC Agreement, AIM was issued a newly-created class of membership interests in CIM pursuant to which AIM will, among other things, share in the profits, losses, distributions and expenses of CIM with the other members in accordance with the terms of the Third CIM LLC Agreement, which will ultimately result in CIG and AIM each owning a 50% economic interest in CIM.\nOn July 10, 2017, our independent directors unanimously approved the termination of the investment sub-advisory agreement with AIM, effective as of July 11, 2017, as part of the new and ongoing relationship among us, CIM and AIM. Although the investment sub-advisory agreement and AIM's engagement as our investment sub-adviser were terminated, AIM continues to perform identical services for CIM and us, including, without limitation, identifying investment opportunities for approval by CIM's investment committee. AIM will not be paid a separate fee in exchange for such services, but will be entitled to receive distributions as a member of CIM as described above.\nOn December 4, 2017, the members of CIM entered into the Fourth CIM LLC Agreement. Under the Fourth CIM LLC Agreement, AIM's responsibilities include, among other things, identifying and providing information about potential investment opportunities for approval by CIM's investment committee and providing reasonable expertise and knowledge with respect to CIM-sourced transactions.\nWe seek to meet our investment objective by utilizing the experienced management team of CIM, which includes its access to the relationships and human capital of its affiliates in sourcing, evaluating and structuring transactions, as well as monitoring and servicing our investments. We focus primarily on the senior secured debt of private and thinly-traded U.S. middle-market companies, which we define as companies that generally possess annual EBITDA of $50 million or less, with experienced management teams, significant free cash flow, strong competitive positions and potential for growth.\nRevenue\nWe primarily generate revenue in the form of interest income on the debt securities that we hold and capital gains on debt or other equity interests that we acquire in portfolio companies. The majority of our senior debt investments bear interest at a floating rate. Interest on debt securities is generally payable quarterly or monthly. In some cases, some of our investments may provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued, but unpaid, interest generally will become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, structuring or diligence fees, monitoring fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and possibly consulting fees and performance-based fees. Any such fees generated in connection with our investments will be recognized when earned.\nOperating Expenses\nOur primary operating expenses are the payment of advisory fees under the investment advisory agreement and interest expense on our financing arrangements. Our investment advisory fees compensates CIM for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, executing, monitoring and servicing our investments. We bear all other expenses of our operations and transactions.\nPortfolio Investment Activity for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nThe following table summarizes our investment activity, excluding short term investments and PIK securities, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Investment Activity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Investment Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Return Swap\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Investment Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Return Swap\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchases and drawdowns\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior secured first lien debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,171,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,220,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>423,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>452,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior secured second lien debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>224,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>224,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collateralized securities and structured products -

investments that are in the form of lines of credit, delayed draw term loans, revolving credit facilities, or unfunded commitments, which may require us to provide funding when requested in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreements. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, our unfunded commitments amounted to $48,259 and $25,096, respectively. As of March 8, 2018, our unfunded commitments amounted to $68,150. Since these commitments may expire without being drawn upon, unfunded commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements or future earning assets for us. Refer to the section Commitments and Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\u201d for further details on our unfunded commitments.\nInvestment Portfolio Asset Quality\nCIM uses an investment rating system to characterize and monitor our expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. These ratings are just one of several factors that CIM uses to monitor our portfolio, are not in and of themselves determinative of fair value or revenue recognition and are presented for indicative purposes. CIM rates the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 to 5 no less frequently than quarterly. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of acquisition), although it may also take into account under certain circumstances the performance of the portfolio company's business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors.\nThe following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating used in this ratings system:\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Rating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Description\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Indicates the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis.

In addition, changes in the rating of investments may be made to reflect our expectation of performance and changes in investment values.\nCurrent Investment Portfolio\nAs of March 8, 2018, our investment portfolio, excluding our short term investments, consisted of interests in 150 portfolio companies (75% in senior secured first lien debt, 21% in senior secured second lien debt, 3% in collateralized securities and structured products (comprised of 1% invested in rated debt, 1% invested in non-rated debt and 1% invested in non-rated equity of such securities and products), less than 1% in unsecured debt and 1% in equity) with a total fair value of $1,571,703 with an average and median portfolio company annual EBITDA of $70.9 million and $50.2 million, respectively, at initial investment. As of March 8, 2018, investments in our portfolio, excluding our short term investments, were purchased at a weighted average price of 95.88% of par value. Our estimated gross annual portfolio yield was 8.94% based upon the purchase price of such investments. The estimated gross portfolio yield does not represent and may be higher than an actual investment return to shareholders because it excludes our expenses and all sales commissions and dealer manager fees. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our total investment return-net asset value was 8.76%. Total investment return-net asset value does not represent and may be higher than an actual investment return to shareholders because it excludes all sales commissions and dealer manager fees. Total investment return-net asset value is a measure of the change in total value for shareholders who held our common stock at the beginning and end of the period, including distributions paid or payable during the period, and is described further in Note 13 of our consolidated financial statements.\nAs of March 8, 2018, our only short term investment was an investment in a U.S. Treasury Obligations Fund of $181,889.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nOur results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>144,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net operating expenses\n</td> <td>65,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>79,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized (loss) gain on investments and foreign currency\n</td> <td>(4,861\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in unrealized appreciation on investments\n</td> <td>9,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized (loss) gain on total return swap\n</td> <td>(13,956\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in unrealized appreciation on total return swap\n</td> <td>15,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in net assets resulting from operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment Income\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we generated investment income of $144,988 and $80,590, respectively, consisting primarily of interest income on investments in senior secured debt, collateralized securities, structured products, and unsecured debt of 214 and 131 portfolio companies held during each respective period. Our average investment portfolio size, excluding our short term investments and TRS, increased $428,371, from $834,944 during the year ended December 31, 2016 to $1,263,315 during the year ended December 31, 2017, as we deployed the net proceeds from our financing arrangements and the net proceeds from our follow-on continuous public offering, which commenced on January 25, 2016. We expect our investment portfolio to continue to grow due to the anticipated equity available to us for investment from our follow-on continuous public offering and amounts available under our financing arrangements. As a result, we believe that reported investment income for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is not representative of our stabilized or future performance. Interest income earned by loans underlying the TRS was not included in investment income in the consolidated statements of operations, but rather it was recorded as part of net realized (loss) gain on total return swap. In lieu of extending the expiration date of the TRS beyond April 18, 2017, we entered into a traditional credit facility with Citibank on March 29, 2017.\nOperating Expenses\nThe composition of our operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was as follows:\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management fees\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Administrative services expense\n</td> <td>2,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated incentive fee on income\n</td> <td>3,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>7,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>23,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>65,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recoupment of expense support from CIG\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>667\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the increase in management fees was a direct result of the increase in our net assets, while the increase in interest expense was primarily the result of entering into new financing arrangements. The decrease in recoupment of expense support from CIG was a result of our reimbursement of all previously provided expense support from CIG as of December 31, 2017. The increase in the subordinated incentive fee on income was a result of us reaching the hurdle rate of 1.875% for pre-incentive fee net investment income for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nThe composition of our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was as follows:\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transfer agent expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Valuation expense\n</td> <td>1,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>625\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional fees\n</td> <td>1,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dues and subscriptions\n</td> <td>837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>775\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Director fees and expenses\n</td> <td>438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>274\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance expense\n</td> <td>411\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>376\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Printing and marketing expense\n</td> <td>374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>553\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounting costs\n</td> <td>237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>241\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Due diligence fees\n</td> <td>165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>470\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Filing fees\n</td> <td>73\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>455\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total general and administrative expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nExpense Support and Recoupment of Expense Support\nOur affiliate, CIG, agreed to provide expense support to us commencing with the quarter ended December 31, 2012 for certain expenses pursuant to the expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement. We further amended and restated the expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement on December 16, 2015 and December 14, 2016 for purposes of including AIM as a party to the expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement and extending the termination date from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, respectively. On January 2, 2018, we entered into an expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement with CIM for purposes of (i) replacing CIG and AIM with CIM as the expense support provider pursuant to the terms of the expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement; and (ii) extending the termination date to December 31, 2018. Refer to the discussion under Related Party Transactions\u201d below for further details about the expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement. Also, see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure regarding expense support from CIM, CIG and/or AIM.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, CIG recouped all remaining unreimbursed expense support of $667, which was made during the three months ended December 31, 2014, in connection with the expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement. We did not record any expense support recoupment during the year ended December 31, 2017 as all expense support had been previously recouped. We did not receive any expense support from CIG or AIM for the years ended December 31, 2017 or 2016.\nRecoupment of such support will be determined as appropriate to meet the objectives of the expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement. As a result, we may or may not be requested to reimburse CIM for any expense support that may be received from CIM in the future.\nNet Investment Income\nOur net investment income totaled $79,866 and $47,711 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in net investment income was primarily due to the refinancing of the TRS into a traditional credit facility and an increase in the size of our investment portfolio relative to our expenses as we continued to achieve economies of scale due to proceeds received from our follow-on continuous public offering and our financing arrangements.\nNet Realized (Loss) Gain on Investments and Foreign Currency\nOur net realized (loss) gain on investments and foreign currency totaled $(4,861) and $2,721 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This change was primarily due to realized losses on certain underperforming investments.\nNet Change in Unrealized Appreciation on Investments\nThe net change in unrealized appreciation on our investments totaled $9,448 and $21,584 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This change was driven by the continued tightening of credit spreads during the year ended December 31, 2017 that positively impacted the fair value of certain investments, partially offset by the deteriorating credit quality of certain investments.\nNet Realized (Loss) Gain on TRS\nOur net realized (loss) gain on the TRS totaled $(13,956) and $28,159 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Unrealized appreciation during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to previously unrealized depreciation becoming realized upon the expiration of the TRS. Conversely, unrealized appreciation during the year ended December 31, 2016 was driven primarily by a tightening of credit spreads during 2016 that positively impacted the fair value of certain investments.\nNet Increase in Net Assets Resulting from Operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $85,899 compared to a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $119,673 for the year ended December 31, 2016, as a result of our operating activity for the respective periods.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nOur results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net operating expenses\n</td> <td>32,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>47,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,762\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized gain on investments and foreign currency\n</td> <td>2,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments\n</td> <td>21,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27,587\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized gain on total return swap\n</td> <td>28,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on total return swap\n</td> <td>19,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30,491\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,442\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment Income\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we generated investment income of $80,590 and $52,809, respectively, consisting primarily of interest income on investments in senior secured debt, collateralized securities, structured products, and unsecured debt of 131 and 91 portfolio companies held during each respective period. Our average investment portfolio size, excluding our short term investments and TRS, increased $333,708, from $501,236 during the year ended December 31, 2015 to $834,944 during the year ended December 31, 2016, as we deployed the net proceeds from the JPM Credit Facility and the net proceeds from our follow-on continuous public offering, which commenced on January 25, 2016.

The decrease in recoupment of expense support from CIG was a result of our reimbursement of all previously provided expense support from CIG as of December 31, 2016.\nThe composition of our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was as follows:\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional fees\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transfer agent expense\n</td> <td>1,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dues and subscriptions\n</td> <td>775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>505\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Valuation expense\n</td> <td>625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>310\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Printing and marketing expense\n</td> <td>553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>755\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Due diligence fees\n</td> <td>470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance expense\n</td> <td>376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>297\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Director fees and expenses\n</td> <td>274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>296\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounting costs\n</td> <td>241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Filing fees\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>478\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>298\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total general and administrative expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nExpense Support and Recoupment of Expense Support\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, CIG recouped $667 of expense support made during the three months ended December 31, 2014 in connection with the expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2015, CIG recouped $4,667 of expense support made during each of the three months ended March 31, 2013, June 30, 2013, September 30, 2013, December 31, 2013, March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2014 in connection with the expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement. We did not receive any expense support from CIG or AIM for the years ended December 31, 2016 or 2015.\nNet Investment Income\nOur net investment income totaled $47,711 and $24,762 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in net investment income was primarily due to an increase in the size of our investment portfolio relative to our expenses as we continued to achieve economies of scale due to proceeds received from our continuous public offerings and our credit facilities.\nNet Realized Gain on Investments and Foreign Currency\nOur net realized gain on investments and foreign currency totaled $2,721 and $1,121 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in net realized gain on investments and foreign currency was primarily due to an increase in sales and principal repayment activity during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we received sale proceeds of $34,951 and principal repayments of $194,124, resulting in net realized gains of $2,721. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we received sale proceeds of $71,605 and principal repayments of $41,828, resulting in net realized gains of $1,121.\nNet Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments\nThe net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our investments totaled $21,584 and ($27,587) for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This change was driven primarily by a tightening of credit spreads during the year ended December 31, 2016 that positively impacted the fair value of certain investments.\nNet Realized Gain on TRS\nOur net realized gain on the TRS totaled $28,159 and $30,753 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The components of net realized gain on the TRS are summarized below:\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other income from TRS portfolio\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other expense from TRS portfolio\n</td> <td>(13,473\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,218\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gain on TRS loan sales\n</td> <td>1,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>472\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on TRS\nThe net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on the TRS totaled $19,498 and ($30,491) for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This change was driven primarily by a tightening of credit spreads during the year ended December 31, 2016 that positively impacted the fair value of certain investments.\nNet Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $119,673 compared to a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of ($1,442) for the year ended December 31, 2015, as a result of our operating activity for the respective periods.\nNet Asset Value per Share, Annual Investment Return and Total Return Since Inception\nOur net asset value per share was $9.14 and $9.11 on December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. After considering (i) the overall changes in net asset value per share, (ii) paid distributions of approximately $0.7316 per share during the year ended December 31, 2017, and (iii) the assumed reinvestment of those distributions in accordance with our distribution reinvestment plan then in effect, the total investment return-net asset value was 8.76% for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017. Total investment return-net asset value does not represent and may be higher than an actual return to shareholders because it excludes all sales commissions and dealer manager fees. Total investment return-net asset value is a measure of the change in total value for shareholders who held our common stock at the beginning and end of the period, including distributions paid or payable during the period, and is described further in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nInitial shareholders who subscribed to the offering in December 2012 with an initial investment of $10,000 and an initial purchase price equal to $9.00 per share (public offering price net of sales load) have seen an annualized return of 8.43% and a cumulative total return of 50.45% through December 31, 2017 (see chart below). Initial shareholders who subscribed to the offering in December 2012 with an initial investment of $10,000 and an initial purchase price equal to $10.00 per share (the initial public offering price including sales load) have seen an annualized return of 6.19% and a cumulative total return of 35.40% through December 31, 2017. Over the same time period, the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index, a primary measure of senior debt covering the U.S. leveraged loan market, which currently consists of approximately 1,000 credit facilities throughout numerous industries, recorded an annualized return of 4.16% and a cumulative total return of 22.80%. In addition, the BofA Merrill Lynch US High Yield Index, a primary measure of short-term US dollar denominated below investment grade corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market, recorded an annualized return of 5.79% and a cumulative total return of 32.81% over the same period.\n(1) Cumulative performance: December 17, 2012 to December 31, 2017\nThe calculations for the Growth of $10,000 Initial Investment are based upon (i) an initial investment of $10,000 in our common stock at the beginning of the period, at a share price of $10.00 per share (including sales load) and $9.00 per share (excluding sales load), (ii) assumes reinvestment of monthly distributions in accordance with our distribution reinvestment plan then in effect, (iii) the sale of the entire investment position at the net asset value per share on the last day of the period, and (iv) the distributions declared and payable to shareholders, if any, on the last day of the period.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe generate cash primarily from the net proceeds from our follow-on continuous public offering and from cash flows from interest, fees and dividends earned from our investments as well as principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. We also employ leverage to seek to enhance our returns as market conditions permit and at the discretion of CIM, but in no event will leverage employed exceed 50% of the value of our total assets, as required by the 1940 Act. We are engaged in a follow-on continuous public offering of shares of our common stock. Our initial continuous public offering commenced on July 2, 2012 and ended on December 31, 2015. Our follow-on continuous public offering commenced on January 25, 2016 and will continue until no later than January 25, 2019. We accept subscriptions on a continuous basis and issue shares at weekly closings at prices that, after deducting selling commissions and dealer manager fees, are at or above our net asset value per share.\nWe will sell our shares on a continuous basis at our latest public offering price of $9.70 per share; however, to the extent that our net asset value fluctuates, we will sell at a price necessary to ensure that shares are sold at a price, after deduction of selling commissions and dealer manager fees, that is above and within 2.5% of net asset value per share.\nSince commencing our initial continuous public offering on July 2, 2012 and through December 31, 2017, we sold 115,781,751 shares of common stock for net proceeds of $1,174,850 at an average price per share of $10.15. The net proceeds include gross proceeds received from reinvested shareholder distributions of $124,132, for which we issued 13,623,777 shares of common stock, and gross proceeds paid for shares of common stock tendered for repurchase of $65,821, for which we repurchased 7,261,847 shares of common stock. Since commencing our initial continuous public offering on July 2, 2012 and through December 31, 2017, sales commissions and dealer manager fees related to the sale of our common stock were $64,460 and $31,982, respectively.\nAs of March 8, 2018, we sold 115,468,781 shares of common stock for net proceeds of $1,172,457 at an average price per share of $10.15. The net proceeds include gross proceeds received from reinvested shareholder distributions of $130,958, for which we issued 14,369,911 shares of common stock, and gross proceeds paid for shares of common stock tendered for repurchase of $84,199, for which we repurchased 9,276,383 shares of common stock. Since commencing our initial continuous public offering on July 2, 2012 and through March 8, 2018, sales commissions and dealer manager fees related to the sale of our common stock were $64,649 and $32,147, respectively.\nThe net proceeds from our follow-on continuous public offering will be invested primarily in cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements and high-quality debt instruments maturing in one year or less prior to being invested in debt securities of private U.S. middle-market companies.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had $206,547 and $70,498 in short term investments, respectively, invested in a fund that primarily invests in U.S. government securities.\nCitibank Credit Facility\nAs of December 31, 2017 and March 8, 2018, our outstanding borrowings under the Amended Citibank Credit Facility were $324,542 and the aggregate unfunded principal amount in connection with the Amended Citibank Credit Facility was $458. For a detailed discussion of our Amended Citibank Credit Facility, refer to Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nJPM Credit Facility\nAs of December 31, 2017 and March 8, 2018, our outstanding borrowings under the Amended JPM Credit Facility were $224,423 and the aggregate unfunded principal amount in connection with the Amended JPM Credit Facility was $577. For a detailed discussion of our Amended JPM Credit Facility, refer to Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nUBS Facility\nAs of December 31, 2017 and March 8, 2018, our outstanding borrowings under the UBS Facility were $162,500 and the aggregate unfunded principal amount in connection with the UBS Facility was $37,500. For a detailed discussion of our UBS Facility, refer to Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nMS Credit Facility\nAs of December 31, 2017 and March 8, 2018, we had no outstanding borrowings under the MS Credit Facility and the aggregate unfunded principal amount in connection with the MS Credit Facility was $200,000. For a detailed discussion of our MS Credit Facility, refer to Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nUnfunded Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2017 and March 8, 2018, our unfunded commitments amounted to $48,259 and $68,150, respectively. For a detailed discussion of our unfunded commitments, refer to Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nRIC Status and Distributions\nPrior to the refinancing of the TRS, our total investment portfolio included loans and other securities on our consolidated balance sheets and loans underlying the TRS. Accordingly, we treated net interest and other income earned on all investments, including the loans underlying the TRS, as a component of investment company taxable income when determining our sources of distributions. The sources of our distributions for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Investment Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Return Swap Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Investment Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Investment Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Return Swap Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Investment Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gains from the sale of assets(1)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31, 2017, we distributed long-term capital gains of $927.

Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, we also utilize available information, including our past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming our estimates and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. Actual results may differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses.\nValuation of Portfolio Investments\nThe value of our assets is determined quarterly and at such other times that an event occurs that materially affects the valuation. The valuation is made pursuant to Section 2(a)(41) of the 1940 Act, which requires that we value our assets as follows: (i) the market price for those securities for which a market quotation is readily available, and (ii) for all other securities and assets, at fair value, as determined in good faith by our board of directors. As a BDC, Section 2(a)(41) of the 1940 Act requires the board of directors to determine in good faith the fair value of portfolio securities for which a market price is not readily available, and it does so in conjunction with the application of our valuation procedures by CIM.\nThere is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each asset while employing a valuation process that is consistently followed. Determinations of fair value involve subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations in our consolidated financial statements.\nValuation Methods\nWith respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, we undertake a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by certain of CIM's investment professionals and certain members of its management team, with such valuation taking into account information received from various sources, including independent valuation firms, if applicable;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with CIM's valuation committee;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>CIM's valuation committee reviews the preliminary valuation, and, if applicable, delivers such preliminary valuation to an independent valuation firm for its review;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>CIM's valuation committee, or its designee, and, if appropriate, the relevant investment professionals meet with the independent valuation firm to discuss the preliminary valuation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>designated members of CIM's management team respond and supplement the preliminary valuation to reflect any comments provided by the independent valuation firm;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our audit committee meets with members of CIM's management team and the independent valuation firm to discuss the assistance provided and the results of the independent valuation firm's review; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our board of directors discusses the valuation and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith based on various statistical and other factors, including the input and recommendation of CIM, the audit committee and any third-party valuation firm, if applicable.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to the foregoing, certain investments for which a market price is not readily available are evaluated on a quarterly basis by an independent valuation firm and certain other investments are on a rotational basis reviewed once over a twelve-month period by an independent valuation firm. Finally, certain investments are not evaluated by an independent valuation firm unless the net asset value and other aspects of such investments in the aggregate exceed certain thresholds.\nGiven the expected types of investments, excluding short term investments that are classified as Level 1, management expects our portfolio holdings to be classified as Level 3. Due to the uncertainty inherent in the valuation process, particularly for Level 3 investments, such fair value estimates may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had an active market for the investments existed. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses that we ultimately realize on these investments to materially differ from the valuations currently assigned. Inputs used in the valuation process are subject to variability in the future and can result in materially different fair values.\nFor an additional discussion of our investment valuation process, refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nRelated Party Transactions\nFor a discussion of our relationship with related parties including CION Securities, CIM, ICON Capital, and CIG and amounts incurred under agreements with such related parties, refer to Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nContractual Obligations\nOn August 26, 2016, 34th Street entered into the JPM Credit Facility with JPM, as amended and restated on September 30, 2016, July 11, 2017 and November 28, 2017.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, the following discussion and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties.\nOverview\nWe were incorporated under the general corporation laws of the State of Maryland on August 9, 2011 and commenced operations on December 17, 2012 upon raising proceeds of $2,500 from persons not affiliated with us, CIM or Apollo. We are an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a RIC, as defined under Subchapter M of the Code.\nOur investment objective is to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation for investors. Our portfolio is comprised primarily of investments in senior secured debt, including first lien loans, second lien loans and unitranche loans, and, to a lesser extent, collateralized securities, structured products and other similar securities, unsecured debt, including corporate bonds and long-term subordinated loans, referred to as mezzanine loans, and equity, of private and thinly-traded U.S. middle-market companies. In connection with our debt investments, we may receive equity interests such as warrants or options as additional consideration. We may also purchase minority interests in the form of common or preferred equity in our target companies, either in conjunction with one of our debt investments or through a co-investment with a financial sponsor.\nWe are managed by CIM, our affiliate and a registered investment adviser. CIM oversees the management of our activities and is responsible for making investment decisions for our portfolio. On November 1, 2017, our board of directors, including a majority of directors who are not interested persons, approved the renewal of the investment advisory agreement with CIM for a period of twelve months commencing December 17, 2017. We and CIM previously engaged AIM to act as our investment sub-adviser.\nOn July 11, 2017, the members of CIM entered into the Third CIM LLC Agreement for the purpose of creating a joint venture between AIM and CIG. Under the Third CIM LLC Agreement, AIM was issued a newly-created class of membership interests in CIM pursuant to which AIM will, among other things, share in the profits, losses, distributions and expenses of CIM with the other members in accordance with the terms of the Third CIM LLC Agreement, which will ultimately result in CIG and AIM each owning a 50% economic interest in CIM.\nOn July 10, 2017, our independent directors unanimously approved the termination of the investment sub-advisory agreement with AIM, effective as of July 11, 2017, as part of the new and ongoing relationship among us, CIM and AIM. Although the investment sub-advisory agreement and AIM's engagement as our investment sub-adviser were terminated, AIM continues to perform identical services for CIM and us, including, without limitation, identifying investment opportunities for approval by CIM's investment committee. AIM will not be paid a separate fee in exchange for such services, but will be entitled to receive distributions as a member of CIM as described above.\nOn December 4, 2017, the members of CIM entered into the Fourth CIM LLC Agreement. Under the Fourth CIM LLC Agreement, AIM's responsibilities include, among other things, identifying and providing information about potential investment opportunities for approval by CIM's investment committee and providing reasonable expertise and knowledge with respect to CIM-sourced transactions.\nWe seek to meet our investment objective by utilizing the experienced management team of CIM, which includes its access to the relationships and human capital of its affiliates in sourcing, evaluating and structuring transactions, as well as monitoring and servicing our investments. We focus primarily on the senior secured debt of private and thinly-traded U.S. middle-market companies, which we define as companies that generally possess annual EBITDA of $50 million or less, with experienced management teams, significant free cash flow, strong competitive positions and potential for growth.\nRevenue\nWe primarily generate revenue in the form of interest income on the debt securities that we hold and capital gains on debt or other equity interests that we acquire in portfolio companies. The majority of our senior debt investments bear interest at a floating rate. Interest on debt securities is generally payable quarterly or monthly. In some cases, some of our investments may provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued, but unpaid, interest generally will become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, structuring or diligence fees, monitoring fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and possibly consulting fees and performance-based fees. Any such fees generated in connection with our investments will be recognized when earned.\nOperating Expenses\nOur primary operating expenses are the payment of advisory fees under the investment advisory agreement and interest expense on our financing arrangements. Our investment advisory fees compensates CIM for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, executing, monitoring and servicing our investments. We bear all other expenses of our operations and transactions.\nPortfolio Investment Activity for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nThe following table summarizes our investment activity, excluding short term investments and PIK securities, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n\nThe following table summarizes the composition of our investment portfolio at amortized cost and fair value as of December 31, 2017:\n\n (1) Represents amortized cost for debt investments and cost for equity investments. Amortized cost represents the original cost adjusted for the amortization of premiums and/or accretion of discounts, as applicable, on our investments. \n (2) Short term investments represent an investment in a fund that invests in highly liquid investments with average original maturity dates of three months or less. \n (3) The gross annual portfolio yield does not represent and may be higher than an actual investment return to shareholders because it excludes our expenses and all sales commissions and dealer manager fees and does not consider the cost of leverage. \nThe following table summarizes the composition of our investment portfolio at amortized cost and fair value and our underlying TRS loans portfolio at notional amount and fair value as of December 31, 2016:\n\n (1) Represents amortized cost for debt investments and cost for equity investments. Amortized cost represents the original cost adjusted for the amortization of premiums and/or accretion of discounts, as applicable, on our investments. \n (2) Short term investments represent an investment in a fund that invests in highly liquid investments with average original maturity dates of three months or less. \n (3) The sum of investment portfolio and TRS portfolio companies does not equal the total number of portfolio companies. This is due to 11 portfolio companies being in both the investment and TRS portfolios. \n (4) The gross annual portfolio yield does not represent and may be higher than an actual investment return to shareholders because it excludes our expenses and all sales commissions and dealer manager fees and does not consider the cost of leverage. \nThe following table summarizes the composition of our investment portfolio by the type of interest rate as of December 31, 2017, excluding short term investments of $206,547:\n\nThe following table summarizes the composition of our investment portfolio and our underlying TRS loans portfolio by the type of interest rate as of December 31, 2016, excluding short term investments of $70,498:\n\nThe following table shows the composition of our investment portfolio by industry classification and the percentage, by fair value, of the total assets in such industries as of December 31, 2017:\n\nThe following table shows the composition of our investment portfolio and our underlying TRS loans portfolio by industry classification and the percentage, by fair value, of the total assets in such industries as of December 31, 2016:\n\nOur investment portfolio may contain senior secured investments that are in the form of lines of credit, delayed draw term loans, revolving credit facilities, or unfunded commitments, which may require us to provide funding when requested in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreements. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, our unfunded commitments amounted to $48,259 and $25,096, respectively. As of March 8, 2018, our unfunded commitments amounted to $68,150. Since these commitments may expire without being drawn upon, unfunded commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements or future earning assets for us. Refer to the section Commitments and Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\u201d for further details on our unfunded commitments.\nInvestment Portfolio Asset Quality\nCIM uses an investment rating system to characterize and monitor our expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. These ratings are just one of several factors that CIM uses to monitor our portfolio, are not in and of themselves determinative of fair value or revenue recognition and are presented for indicative purposes. CIM rates the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 to 5 no less frequently than quarterly. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of acquisition), although it may also take into account under certain circumstances the performance of the portfolio company's business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors.\nThe following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating used in this ratings system:\n Investment Rating Description 1 Indicates the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis. The trends and risk factors for this investment since origination or acquisition are generally favorable, which may include the performance of the portfolio company or a potential exit. 2 Indicates a level of risk to our initial cost basis that is similar to the risk to our initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition. This portfolio company is generally performing in accordance with our analysis of its business and the full return of principal and interest or dividend is expected. 3 Indicates that the risk to our ability to recoup the cost of such investment has increased since origination or acquisition, but full return of principal and interest or dividend is expected. A portfolio company with an investment rating of 3 requires closer monitoring. 4 Indicates that the risk to our ability to recoup the cost of such investment has increased significantly since origination or acquisition, including as a result of factors such as declining performance and noncompliance with debt covenants, and we expect some loss of interest, dividend or capital appreciation, but still expect an overall positive internal rate of return on the investment. 5 Indicates that the risk to our ability to recoup the cost of such investment has increased materially since origination or acquisition and the portfolio company likely has materially declining performance. Loss of interest or dividend and some loss of principal investment is expected, which would result in an overall negative internal rate of return on the investment. \nFor investments rated 3, 4, or 5, CIM enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company.\nThe following table summarizes the composition of our investment portfolio based on the 1 to 5 investment rating scale at fair value as of December 31, 2017, excluding short term investments of $206,547:\n\nThe following table summarizes the composition of our investment portfolio and our underlying TRS loans portfolio based on the 1 to 5 investment rating scale at fair value as of December 31, 2016, excluding short term investments of $70,498:\n\nThe amount of the investment portfolio in each rating category may vary substantially from period to period resulting primarily from changes in the composition of such portfolio as a result of new investment, repayment and exit activities. In addition, changes in the rating of investments may be made to reflect our expectation of performance and changes in investment values.\nCurrent Investment Portfolio\nAs of March 8, 2018, our investment portfolio, excluding our short term investments, consisted of interests in 150 portfolio companies (75% in senior secured first lien debt, 21% in senior secured second lien debt, 3% in collateralized securities and structured products (comprised of 1% invested in rated debt, 1% invested in non-rated debt and 1% invested in non-rated equity of such securities and products), less than 1% in unsecured debt and 1% in equity) with a total fair value of $1,571,703 with an average and median portfolio company annual EBITDA of $70.9 million and $50.2 million, respectively, at initial investment. As of March 8, 2018, investments in our portfolio, excluding our short term investments, were purchased at a weighted average price of 95.88% of par value. Our estimated gross annual portfolio yield was 8.94% based upon the purchase price of such investments. The estimated gross portfolio yield does not represent and may be higher than an actual investment return to shareholders because it excludes our expenses and all sales commissions and dealer manager fees. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our total investment return-net asset value was 8.76%. Total investment return-net asset value does not represent and may be higher than an actual investment return to shareholders because it excludes all sales commissions and dealer manager fees. Total investment return-net asset value is a measure of the change in total value for shareholders who held our common stock at the beginning and end of the period, including distributions paid or payable during the period, and is described further in Note 13 of our consolidated financial statements.\nAs of March 8, 2018, our only short term investment was an investment in a U.S. Treasury Obligations Fund of $181,889.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nOur results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\n\nInvestment Income\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we generated investment income of $144,988 and $80,590, respectively, consisting primarily of interest income on investments in senior secured debt, collateralized securities, structured products, and unsecured debt of 214 and 131 portfolio companies held during each respective period. Our average investment portfolio size, excluding our short term investments and TRS, increased $428,371, from $834,944 during the year ended December 31, 2016 to $1,263,315 during the year ended December 31, 2017, as we deployed the net proceeds from our financing arrangements and the net proceeds from our follow-on continuous public offering, which commenced on January 25, 2016. We expect our investment portfolio to continue to grow due to the anticipated equity available to us for investment from our follow-on continuous public offering and amounts available under our financing arrangements. As a result, we believe that reported investment income for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is not representative of our stabilized or future performance. Interest income earned by loans underlying the TRS was not included in investment income in the consolidated statements of operations, but rather it was recorded as part of net realized (loss) gain on total return swap. In lieu of extending the expiration date of the TRS beyond April 18, 2017, we entered into a traditional credit facility with Citibank on March 29, 2017.\nOperating Expenses\nThe composition of our operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was as follows:\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the increase in management fees was a direct result of the increase in our net assets, while the increase in interest expense was primarily the result of entering into new financing arrangements. The decrease in recoupment of expense support from CIG was a result of our reimbursement of all previously provided expense support from CIG as of December 31, 2017. The increase in the subordinated incentive fee on income was a result of us reaching the hurdle rate of 1.875% for pre-incentive fee net investment income for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nThe composition of our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was as follows:\n\nExpense Support and Recoupment of Expense Support\nOur affiliate, CIG, agreed to provide expense support to us commencing with the quarter ended December 31, 2012 for certain expenses pursuant to the expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement. We further amended and restated the expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement on December 16, 2015 and December 14, 2016 for purposes of including AIM as a party to the expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement and extending the termination date from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, respectively. On January 2, 2018, we entered into an expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement with CIM for purposes of (i) replacing CIG and AIM with CIM as the expense support provider pursuant to the terms of the expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement; and (ii) extending the termination date to December 31, 2018. Refer to the discussion under Related Party Transactions\u201d below for further details about the expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement. Also, see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure regarding expense support from CIM, CIG and/or AIM.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, CIG recouped all remaining unreimbursed expense support of $667, which was made during the three months ended December 31, 2014, in connection with the expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement. We did not record any expense support recoupment during the year ended December 31, 2017 as all expense support had been previously recouped. We did not receive any expense support from CIG or AIM for the years ended December 31, 2017 or 2016.\nRecoupment of such support will be determined as appropriate to meet the objectives of the expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement. As a result, we may or may not be requested to reimburse CIM for any expense support that may be received from CIM in the future.\nNet Investment Income\nOur net investment income totaled $79,866 and $47,711 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in net investment income was primarily due to the refinancing of the TRS into a traditional credit facility and an increase in the size of our investment portfolio relative to our expenses as we continued to achieve economies of scale due to proceeds received from our follow-on continuous public offering and our financing arrangements.\nNet Realized (Loss) Gain on Investments and Foreign Currency\nOur net realized (loss) gain on investments and foreign currency totaled $(4,861) and $2,721 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This change was primarily due to realized losses on certain underperforming investments.\nNet Change in Unrealized Appreciation on Investments\nThe net change in unrealized appreciation on our investments totaled $9,448 and $21,584 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This change was driven by the continued tightening of credit spreads during the year ended December 31, 2017 that positively impacted the fair value of certain investments, partially offset by the deteriorating credit quality of certain investments.\nNet Realized (Loss) Gain on TRS\nOur net realized (loss) gain on the TRS totaled $(13,956) and $28,159 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The components of net realized (loss) gain on the TRS are summarized below:\n\nNet Change in Unrealized Appreciation on TRS\nThe net change in unrealized appreciation on the TRS totaled $15,402 and $19,498 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Unrealized appreciation during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to previously unrealized depreciation becoming realized upon the expiration of the TRS. Conversely, unrealized appreciation during the year ended December 31, 2016 was driven primarily by a tightening of credit spreads during 2016 that positively impacted the fair value of certain investments.\nNet Increase in Net Assets Resulting from Operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $85,899 compared to a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $119,673 for the year ended December 31, 2016, as a result of our operating activity for the respective periods.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nOur results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\n\nInvestment Income\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we generated investment income of $80,590 and $52,809, respectively, consisting primarily of interest income on investments in senior secured debt, collateralized securities, structured products, and unsecured debt of 131 and 91 portfolio companies held during each respective period. Our average investment portfolio size, excluding our short term investments and TRS, increased $333,708, from $501,236 during the year ended December 31, 2015 to $834,944 during the year ended December 31, 2016, as we deployed the net proceeds from the JPM Credit Facility and the net proceeds from our follow-on continuous public offering, which commenced on January 25, 2016. We expect our investment portfolio to continue to grow due to the anticipated equity available to us for investment from our follow-on continuous public offering. As a result, we believe that reported investment income for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is not representative of our stabilized or future performance. Interest income earned by loans underlying the TRS was not included in investment income in the consolidated statements of operations, but rather it was recorded as part of net realized gain on total return swap.\nOperating Expenses\nThe composition of our operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was as follows:\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the increase in management fees was a direct result of the increase in our net assets, while the increase in interest expense was a result of entering into the JPM Credit Facility on August 26, 2016. The decrease in recoupment of expense support from CIG was a result of our reimbursement of all previously provided expense support from CIG as of December 31, 2016.\nThe composition of our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was as follows:\n\nExpense Support and Recoupment of Expense Support\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, CIG recouped $667 of expense support made during the three months ended December 31, 2014 in connection with the expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2015, CIG recouped $4,667 of expense support made during each of the three months ended March 31, 2013, June 30, 2013, September 30, 2013, December 31, 2013, March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2014 in connection with the expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement. We did not receive any expense support from CIG or AIM for the years ended December 31, 2016 or 2015.\nNet Investment Income\nOur net investment income totaled $47,711 and $24,762 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in net investment income was primarily due to an increase in the size of our investment portfolio relative to our expenses as we continued to achieve economies of scale due to proceeds received from our continuous public offerings and our credit facilities.\nNet Realized Gain on Investments and Foreign Currency\nOur net realized gain on investments and foreign currency totaled $2,721 and $1,121 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in net realized gain on investments and foreign currency was primarily due to an increase in sales and principal repayment activity during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we received sale proceeds of $34,951 and principal repayments of $194,124, resulting in net realized gains of $2,721. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we received sale proceeds of $71,605 and principal repayments of $41,828, resulting in net realized gains of $1,121.\nNet Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments\nThe net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our investments totaled $21,584 and ($27,587) for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This change was driven primarily by a tightening of credit spreads during the year ended December 31, 2016 that positively impacted the fair value of certain investments.\nNet Realized Gain on TRS\nOur net realized gain on the TRS totaled $28,159 and $30,753 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The components of net realized gain on the TRS are summarized below:\n\nNet Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on TRS\nThe net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on the TRS totaled $19,498 and ($30,491) for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This change was driven primarily by a tightening of credit spreads during the year ended December 31, 2016 that positively impacted the fair value of certain investments.\nNet Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $119,673 compared to a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of ($1,442) for the year ended December 31, 2015, as a result of our operating activity for the respective periods.\nNet Asset Value per Share, Annual Investment Return and Total Return Since Inception\nOur net asset value per share was $9.14 and $9.11 on December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. After considering (i) the overall changes in net asset value per share, (ii) paid distributions of approximately $0.7316 per share during the year ended December 31, 2017, and (iii) the assumed reinvestment of those distributions in accordance with our distribution reinvestment plan then in effect, the total investment return-net asset value was 8.76% for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017. Total investment return-net asset value does not represent and may be higher than an actual return to shareholders because it excludes all sales commissions and dealer manager fees. Total investment return-net asset value is a measure of the change in total value for shareholders who held our common stock at the beginning and end of the period, including distributions paid or payable during the period, and is described further in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nInitial shareholders who subscribed to the offering in December 2012 with an initial investment of $10,000 and an initial purchase price equal to $9.00 per share (public offering price net of sales load) have seen an annualized return of 8.43% and a cumulative total return of 50.45% through December 31, 2017 (see chart below). Initial shareholders who subscribed to the offering in December 2012 with an initial investment of $10,000 and an initial purchase price equal to $10.00 per share (the initial public offering price including sales load) have seen an annualized return of 6.19% and a cumulative total return of 35.40% through December 31, 2017. Over the same time period, the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index, a primary measure of senior debt covering the U.S. leveraged loan market, which currently consists of approximately 1,000 credit facilities throughout numerous industries, recorded an annualized return of 4.16% and a cumulative total return of 22.80%. In addition, the BofA Merrill Lynch US High Yield Index, a primary measure of short-term US dollar denominated below investment grade corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market, recorded an annualized return of 5.79% and a cumulative total return of 32.81% over the same period.\n(1) Cumulative performance: December 17, 2012 to December 31, 2017\nThe calculations for the Growth of $10,000 Initial Investment are based upon (i) an initial investment of $10,000 in our common stock at the beginning of the period, at a share price of $10.00 per share (including sales load) and $9.00 per share (excluding sales load), (ii) assumes reinvestment of monthly distributions in accordance with our distribution reinvestment plan then in effect, (iii) the sale of the entire investment position at the net asset value per share on the last day of the period, and (iv) the distributions declared and payable to shareholders, if any, on the last day of the period.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe generate cash primarily from the net proceeds from our follow-on continuous public offering and from cash flows from interest, fees and dividends earned from our investments as well as principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. We also employ leverage to seek to enhance our returns as market conditions permit and at the discretion of CIM, but in no event will leverage employed exceed 50% of the value of our total assets, as required by the 1940 Act. We are engaged in a follow-on continuous public offering of shares of our common stock. Our initial continuous public offering commenced on July 2, 2012 and ended on December 31, 2015. Our follow-on continuous public offering commenced on January 25, 2016 and will continue until no later than January 25, 2019. We accept subscriptions on a continuous basis and issue shares at weekly closings at prices that, after deducting selling commissions and dealer manager fees, are at or above our net asset value per share.\nWe will sell our shares on a continuous basis at our latest public offering price of $9.70 per share; however, to the extent that our net asset value fluctuates, we will sell at a price necessary to ensure that shares are sold at a price, after deduction of selling commissions and dealer manager fees, that is above and within 2.5% of net asset value per share.\nSince commencing our initial continuous public offering on July 2, 2012 and through December 31, 2017, we sold 115,781,751 shares of common stock for net proceeds of $1,174,850 at an average price per share of $10.15. The net proceeds include gross proceeds received from reinvested shareholder distributions of $124,132, for which we issued 13,623,777 shares of common stock, and gross proceeds paid for shares of common stock tendered for repurchase of $65,821, for which we repurchased 7,261,847 shares of common stock. Since commencing our initial continuous public offering on July 2, 2012 and through December 31, 2017, sales commissions and dealer manager fees related to the sale of our common stock were $64,460 and $31,982, respectively.\nAs of March 8, 2018, we sold 115,468,781 shares of common stock for net proceeds of $1,172,457 at an average price per share of $10.15. The net proceeds include gross proceeds received from reinvested shareholder distributions of $130,958, for which we issued 14,369,911 shares of common stock, and gross proceeds paid for shares of common stock tendered for repurchase of $84,199, for which we repurchased 9,276,383 shares of common stock. Since commencing our initial continuous public offering on July 2, 2012 and through March 8, 2018, sales commissions and dealer manager fees related to the sale of our common stock were $64,649 and $32,147, respectively.\nThe net proceeds from our follow-on continuous public offering will be invested primarily in cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements and high-quality debt instruments maturing in one year or less prior to being invested in debt securities of private U.S. middle-market companies.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had $206,547 and $70,498 in short term investments, respectively, invested in a fund that primarily invests in U.S. government securities.\nCitibank Credit Facility\nAs of December 31, 2017 and March 8, 2018, our outstanding borrowings under the Amended Citibank Credit Facility were $324,542 and the aggregate unfunded principal amount in connection with the Amended Citibank Credit Facility was $458. For a detailed discussion of our Amended Citibank Credit Facility, refer to Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nJPM Credit Facility\nAs of December 31, 2017 and March 8, 2018, our outstanding borrowings under the Amended JPM Credit Facility were $224,423 and the aggregate unfunded principal amount in connection with the Amended JPM Credit Facility was $577. For a detailed discussion of our Amended JPM Credit Facility, refer to Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nUBS Facility\nAs of December 31, 2017 and March 8, 2018, our outstanding borrowings under the UBS Facility were $162,500 and the aggregate unfunded principal amount in connection with the UBS Facility was $37,500. For a detailed discussion of our UBS Facility, refer to Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nMS Credit Facility\nAs of December 31, 2017 and March 8, 2018, we had no outstanding borrowings under the MS Credit Facility and the aggregate unfunded principal amount in connection with the MS Credit Facility was $200,000. For a detailed discussion of our MS Credit Facility, refer to Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nUnfunded Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2017 and March 8, 2018, our unfunded commitments amounted to $48,259 and $68,150, respectively. For a detailed discussion of our unfunded commitments, refer to Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nRIC Status and Distributions\nPrior to the refinancing of the TRS, our total investment portfolio included loans and other securities on our consolidated balance sheets and loans underlying the TRS. Accordingly, we treated net interest and other income earned on all investments, including the loans underlying the TRS, as a component of investment company taxable income when determining our sources of distributions. The sources of our distributions for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\n\n (1) For the year ended December 31, 2017, we distributed long-term capital gains of $927. We distributed long-term capital gains of $906 for the year ended December 31, 2016. \n (2) During the year ended December 31, 2016, we realized losses of $1,030 in our total return swap portfolio, which were not deductible on a tax-basis until 2017. \nFor an additional discussion of our RIC status and distributions, refer to Note 2 and Note 5, respectively, of our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion of certain recent accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, we also utilize available information, including our past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming our estimates and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. Actual results may differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses.\nValuation of Portfolio Investments\nThe value of our assets is determined quarterly and at such other times that an event occurs that materially affects the valuation. The valuation is made pursuant to Section 2(a)(41) of the 1940 Act, which requires that we value our assets as follows: (i) the market price for those securities for which a market quotation is readily available, and (ii) for all other securities and assets, at fair value, as determined in good faith by our board of directors. As a BDC, Section 2(a)(41) of the 1940 Act requires the board of directors to determine in good faith the fair value of portfolio securities for which a market price is not readily available, and it does so in conjunction with the application of our valuation procedures by CIM.\nThere is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each asset while employing a valuation process that is consistently followed. Determinations of fair value involve subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations in our consolidated financial statements.\nValuation Methods\nWith respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, we undertake a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\n \u2022 our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by certain of CIM's investment professionals and certain members of its management team, with such valuation taking into account information received from various sources, including independent valuation firms, if applicable; \n \u2022 preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with CIM's valuation committee; \n \u2022 CIM's valuation committee reviews the preliminary valuation, and, if applicable, delivers such preliminary valuation to an independent valuation firm for its review; \n \u2022 CIM's valuation committee, or its designee, and, if appropriate, the relevant investment professionals meet with the independent valuation firm to discuss the preliminary valuation; \n \u2022 designated members of CIM's management team respond and supplement the preliminary valuation to reflect any comments provided by the independent valuation firm; \n \u2022 our audit committee meets with members of CIM's management team and the independent valuation firm to discuss the assistance provided and the", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, the following discussion and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties.\nOverview\nWe were incorporated under the general corporation laws of the State of Maryland on August 9, 2011 and commenced operations on December 17, 2012 upon raising proceeds of $2,500 from persons not affiliated with us, CIM or Apollo. We are an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a RIC, as defined under Subchapter M of the Code.\nOur investment objective is to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation for investors. Our portfolio is comprised primarily of investments in senior secured debt, including first lien loans, second lien loans and unitranche loans, and, to a lesser extent, collateralized securities, structured products and other similar securities, unsecured debt, including corporate bonds and long-term subordinated loans, referred to as mezzanine loans, and equity, of private and thinly-traded U.S. middle-market companies. In connection with our debt investments, we may receive equity interests such as warrants or options as additional consideration. We may also purchase minority interests in the form of common or preferred equity in our target companies, either in conjunction with one of our debt investments or through a co-investment with a financial sponsor.\nWe are managed by CIM, our affiliate and a registered investment adviser. CIM oversees the management of our activities and is responsible for making investment decisions for our portfolio. On November 1, 2017, our board of directors, including a majority of directors who are not interested persons, approved the renewal of the investment advisory agreement with CIM for a period of twelve months commencing December 17, 2017. We and CIM previously engaged AIM to act as our investment sub-adviser.\nOn July 11, 2017, the members of CIM entered into the Third CIM LLC Agreement for the purpose of creating a joint venture between AIM and CIG. Under the Third CIM LLC Agreement, AIM was issued a newly-created class of membership interests in CIM pursuant to which AIM will, among other things, share in the profits, losses, distributions and expenses of CIM with the other members in accordance with the terms of the Third CIM LLC Agreement, which will ultimately result in CIG and AIM each owning a 50% economic interest in CIM.\nOn July 10, 2017, our independent directors unanimously approved the termination of the investment sub-advisory agreement with AIM, effective as of July 11, 2017, as part of the new and ongoing relationship among us, CIM and AIM. Although the investment sub-advisory agreement and AIM's engagement as our investment sub-adviser were terminated, AIM continues to perform identical services for CIM and us, including, without limitation, identifying investment opportunities for approval by CIM's investment committee. AIM will not be paid a separate fee in exchange for such services, but will be entitled to receive distributions as a member of CIM as described above.\nOn December 4, 2017, the members of CIM entered into the Fourth CIM LLC Agreement. Under the Fourth CIM LLC Agreement, AIM's responsibilities include, among other things, identifying and providing information about potential investment opportunities for approval by CIM's investment committee and providing reasonable expertise and knowledge with respect to CIM-sourced transactions.\nWe seek to meet our investment objective by utilizing the experienced management team of CIM, which includes its access to the relationships and human capital of its affiliates in sourcing, evaluating and structuring transactions, as well as monitoring and servicing our investments. We focus primarily on the senior secured debt of private and thinly-traded U.S. middle-market companies, which we define as companies that generally possess annual EBITDA of $50 million or less, with experienced management teams, significant free cash flow, strong competitive positions and potential for growth.\nRevenue\nWe primarily generate revenue in the form of interest income on the debt securities that we hold and capital gains on debt or other equity interests that we acquire in portfolio companies. The majority of our senior debt investments bear interest at a floating rate. Interest on debt securities is generally payable quarterly or monthly. In some cases, some of our investments may provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued, but unpaid, interest generally will become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, structuring or diligence fees, monitoring fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and possibly consulting fees and performance-based fees. Any such fees generated in connection with our investments will be recognized when earned.\nOperating Expenses\nOur primary operating expenses are the payment of advisory fees under the investment advisory agreement and interest expense on our financing arrangements.

commitments, which may require us to provide funding when requested in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreements. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, our unfunded commitments amounted to $48,259 and $25,096, respectively. As of March 8, 2018, our unfunded commitments amounted to $68,150. Since these commitments may expire without being drawn upon, unfunded commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements or future earning assets for us. Refer to the section Commitments and Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\u201d for further details on our unfunded commitments.\nInvestment Portfolio Asset Quality\nCIM uses an investment rating system to characterize and monitor our expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. These ratings are just one of several factors that CIM uses to monitor our portfolio, are not in and of themselves determinative of fair value or revenue recognition and are presented for indicative purposes. CIM rates the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 to 5 no less frequently than quarterly. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of acquisition), although it may also take into account under certain circumstances the performance of the portfolio company's business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors.\nThe following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating used in this ratings system:\n Investment Rating Description 1 Indicates the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis. The trends and risk factors for this investment since origination or acquisition are generally favorable, which may include the performance of the portfolio company or a potential exit. 2 Indicates a level of risk to our initial cost basis that is similar to the risk to our initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition. This portfolio company is generally performing in accordance with our analysis of its business and the full return of principal and interest or dividend is expected. 3 Indicates that the risk to our ability to recoup the cost of such investment has increased since origination or acquisition, but full return of principal and interest or dividend is expected. A portfolio company with an investment rating of 3 requires closer monitoring. 4 Indicates that the risk to our ability to recoup the cost of such investment has increased significantly since origination or acquisition, including as a result of factors such as declining performance and noncompliance with debt covenants, and we expect some loss of interest, dividend or capital appreciation, but still expect an overall positive internal rate of return on the investment. 5 Indicates that the risk to our ability to recoup the cost of such investment has increased materially since origination or acquisition and the portfolio company likely has materially declining performance. Loss of interest or dividend and some loss of principal investment is expected, which would result in an overall negative internal rate of return on the investment. \nFor investments rated 3, 4, or 5, CIM enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company.\nThe following table summarizes the composition of our investment portfolio based on the 1 to 5 investment rating scale at fair value as of December 31, 2017, excluding short term investments of $206,547:\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Rating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Investments\nFair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of\nInvestment Portfolio\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,274,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>202,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,507,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes the composition of our investment portfolio and our underlying TRS loans portfolio based on the 1 to 5 investment rating scale at fair value as of December 31, 2016, excluding short term investments of $70,498:\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Investment Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Return Swap\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Rating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Investments\nFair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of\nInvestment Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value of Underlying TRS Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of Underlying TRS Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>963,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>342,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,306,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,018,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>392,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,411,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe amount of the investment portfolio in each rating category may vary substantially from period to period resulting primarily from changes in the composition of such portfolio as a result of new investment, repayment and exit activities. In addition, changes in the rating of investments may be made to reflect our expectation of performance and changes in investment values.\nCurrent Investment Portfolio\nAs of March 8, 2018, our investment portfolio, excluding our short term investments, consisted of interests in 150 portfolio companies (75% in senior secured first lien debt, 21% in senior secured second lien debt, 3% in collateralized securities and structured products (comprised of 1% invested in rated debt, 1% invested in non-rated debt and 1% invested in non-rated equity of such securities and products), less than 1% in unsecured debt and 1% in equity) with a total fair value of $1,571,703 with an average and median portfolio company annual EBITDA of $70.9 million and $50.2 million, respectively, at initial investment. As of March 8, 2018, investments in our portfolio, excluding our short term investments, were purchased at a weighted average price of 95.88% of par value. Our estimated gross annual portfolio yield was 8.94% based upon the purchase price of such investments. The estimated gross portfolio yield does not represent and may be higher than an actual investment return to shareholders because it excludes our expenses and all sales commissions and dealer manager fees. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our total investment return-net asset value was 8.76%. Total investment return-net asset value does not represent and may be higher than an actual investment return to shareholders because it excludes all sales commissions and dealer manager fees. Total investment return-net asset value is a measure of the change in total value for shareholders who held our common stock at the beginning and end of the period, including distributions paid or payable during the period, and is described further in Note 13 of our consolidated financial statements.\nAs of March 8, 2018, our only short term investment was an investment in a U.S. Treasury Obligations Fund of $181,889.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nOur results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>144,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net operating expenses\n</td> <td>65,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>79,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized (loss) gain on investments and foreign currency\n</td> <td>(4,861\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in unrealized appreciation on investments\n</td> <td>9,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized (loss) gain on total return swap\n</td> <td>(13,956\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in unrealized appreciation on total return swap\n</td> <td>15,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in net assets resulting from operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment Income\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we generated investment income of $144,988 and $80,590, respectively, consisting primarily of interest income on investments in senior secured debt, collateralized securities, structured products, and unsecured debt of 214 and 131 portfolio companies held during each respective period. Our average investment portfolio size, excluding our short term investments and TRS, increased $428,371, from $834,944 during the year ended December 31, 2016 to $1,263,315 during the year ended December 31, 2017, as we deployed the net proceeds from our financing arrangements and the net proceeds from our follow-on continuous public offering, which commenced on January 25, 2016. We expect our investment portfolio to continue to grow due to the anticipated equity available to us for investment from our follow-on continuous public offering and amounts available under our financing arrangements. As a result, we believe that reported investment income for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is not representative of our stabilized or future performance. Interest income earned by loans underlying the TRS was not included in investment income in the consolidated statements of operations, but rather it was recorded as part of net realized (loss) gain on total return swap. In lieu of extending the expiration date of the TRS beyond April 18, 2017, we entered into a traditional credit facility with Citibank on March 29, 2017.\nOperating Expenses\nThe composition of our operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was as follows:\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management fees\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Administrative services expense\n</td> <td>2,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated incentive fee on income\n</td> <td>3,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>7,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>23,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>65,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recoupment of expense support from CIG\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>667\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the increase in management fees was a direct result of the increase in our net assets, while the increase in interest expense was primarily the result of entering into new financing arrangements. The decrease in recoupment of expense support from CIG was a result of our reimbursement of all previously provided expense support from CIG as of December 31, 2017. The increase in the subordinated incentive fee on income was a result of us reaching the hurdle rate of 1.875% for pre-incentive fee net investment income for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nThe composition of our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was as follows:\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transfer agent expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Valuation expense\n</td> <td>1,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>625\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional fees\n</td> <td>1,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dues and subscriptions\n</td> <td>837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>775\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Director fees and expenses\n</td> <td>438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>274\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance expense\n</td> <td>411\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>376\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Printing and marketing expense\n</td> <td>374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>553\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounting costs\n</td> <td>237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>241\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Due diligence fees\n</td> <td>165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>470\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Filing fees\n</td> <td>73\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>455\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total general and administrative expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nExpense Support and Recoupment of Expense Support\nOur affiliate, CIG, agreed to provide expense support to us commencing with the quarter ended December 31, 2012 for certain expenses pursuant to the expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement. We further amended and restated the expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement on December 16, 2015 and December 14, 2016 for purposes of including AIM as a party to the expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement and extending the termination date from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, respectively. On January 2, 2018, we entered into an expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement with CIM for purposes of (i) replacing CIG and AIM with CIM as the expense support provider pursuant to the terms of the expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement; and (ii) extending the termination date to December 31, 2018. Refer to the discussion under Related Party Transactions\u201d below for further details about the expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement. Also, see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure regarding expense support from CIM, CIG and/or AIM.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, CIG recouped all remaining unreimbursed expense support of $667, which was made during the three months ended December 31, 2014, in connection with the expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement. We did not record any expense support recoupment during the year ended December 31, 2017 as all expense support had been previously recouped. We did not receive any expense support from CIG or AIM for the years ended December 31, 2017 or 2016.\nRecoupment of such support will be determined as appropriate to meet the objectives of the expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement. As a result, we may or may not be requested to reimburse CIM for any expense support that may be received from CIM in the future.\nNet Investment Income\nOur net investment income totaled $79,866 and $47,711 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in net investment income was primarily due to the refinancing of the TRS into a traditional credit facility and an increase in the size of our investment portfolio relative to our expenses as we continued to achieve economies of scale due to proceeds received from our follow-on continuous public offering and our financing arrangements.\nNet Realized (Loss) Gain on Investments and Foreign Currency\nOur net realized (loss) gain on investments and foreign currency totaled $(4,861) and $2,721 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This change was primarily due to realized losses on certain underperforming investments.\nNet Change in Unrealized Appreciation on Investments\nThe net change in unrealized appreciation on our investments totaled $9,448 and $21,584 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This change was driven by the continued tightening of credit spreads during the year ended December 31, 2017 that positively impacted the fair value of certain investments, partially offset by the deteriorating credit quality of certain investments.\nNet Realized (Loss) Gain on TRS\nOur net realized (loss) gain on the TRS totaled $(13,956) and $28,159 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The components of net realized (loss) gain on the TRS are summarized below:\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other income from TRS portfolio\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other expense from TRS portfolio\n</td> <td>(3,017\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13,473\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) gain on TRS loan sales\n</td> <td>(17,450\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(13,956\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Change in Unrealized Appreciation on TRS\nThe net change in unrealized appreciation on the TRS totaled $15,402 and $19,498 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Unrealized appreciation during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to previously unrealized depreciation becoming realized upon the expiration of the TRS. Conversely, unrealized appreciation during the year ended December 31, 2016 was driven primarily by a tightening of credit spreads during 2016 that positively impacted the fair value of certain investments.\nNet Increase in Net Assets Resulting from Operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $85,899 compared to a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $119,673 for the year ended December 31, 2016, as a result of our operating activity for the respective periods.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nOur results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net operating expenses\n</td> <td>32,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>47,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,762\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized gain on investments and foreign currency\n</td> <td>2,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments\n</td> <td>21,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27,587\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized gain on total return swap\n</td> <td>28,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on total return swap\n</td> <td>19,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30,491\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,442\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment Income\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we generated investment income of $80,590 and $52,809, respectively, consisting primarily of interest income on investments in senior secured debt, collateralized securities, structured products, and unsecured debt of 131 and 91 portfolio companies held during each respective period. Our average investment portfolio size, excluding our short term investments and TRS, increased $333,708, from $501,236 during the year ended December 31, 2015 to $834,944 during the year ended December 31, 2016, as we deployed the net proceeds from the JPM Credit Facility and the net proceeds from our follow-on continuous public offering, which commenced on January 25, 2016. We expect our investment portfolio to continue to grow due to the anticipated equity available to us for investment from our follow-on continuous public offering. As a result, we believe that reported investment income for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is not representative of our stabilized or future performance.

The decrease in recoupment of expense support from CIG was a result of our reimbursement of all previously provided expense support from CIG as of December 31, 2016.\nThe composition of our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was as follows:\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional fees\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transfer agent expense\n</td> <td>1,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dues and subscriptions\n</td> <td>775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>505\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Valuation expense\n</td> <td>625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>310\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Printing and marketing expense\n</td> <td>553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>755\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Due diligence fees\n</td> <td>470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance expense\n</td> <td>376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>297\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Director fees and expenses\n</td> <td>274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>296\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounting costs\n</td> <td>241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Filing fees\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>478\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>298\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total general and administrative expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nExpense Support and Recoupment of Expense Support\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, CIG recouped $667 of expense support made during the three months ended December 31, 2014 in connection with the expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2015, CIG recouped $4,667 of expense support made during each of the three months ended March 31, 2013, June 30, 2013, September 30, 2013, December 31, 2013, March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2014 in connection with the expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement. We did not receive any expense support from CIG or AIM for the years ended December 31, 2016 or 2015.\nNet Investment Income\nOur net investment income totaled $47,711 and $24,762 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in net investment income was primarily due to an increase in the size of our investment portfolio relative to our expenses as we continued to achieve economies of scale due to proceeds received from our continuous public offerings and our credit facilities.\nNet Realized Gain on Investments and Foreign Currency\nOur net realized gain on investments and foreign currency totaled $2,721 and $1,121 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in net realized gain on investments and foreign currency was primarily due to an increase in sales and principal repayment activity during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we received sale proceeds of $34,951 and principal repayments of $194,124, resulting in net realized gains of $2,721. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we received sale proceeds of $71,605 and principal repayments of $41,828, resulting in net realized gains of $1,121.\nNet Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments\nThe net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our investments totaled $21,584 and ($27,587) for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This change was driven primarily by a tightening of credit spreads during the year ended December 31, 2016 that positively impacted the fair value of certain investments.\nNet Realized Gain on TRS\nOur net realized gain on the TRS totaled $28,159 and $30,753 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The components of net realized gain on the TRS are summarized below:\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other income from TRS portfolio\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other expense from TRS portfolio\n</td> <td>(13,473\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,218\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gain on TRS loan sales\n</td> <td>1,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>472\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on TRS\nThe net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on the TRS totaled $19,498 and ($30,491) for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This change was driven primarily by a tightening of credit spreads during the year ended December 31, 2016 that positively impacted the fair value of certain investments.\nNet Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $119,673 compared to a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of ($1,442) for the year ended December 31, 2015, as a result of our operating activity for the respective periods.\nNet Asset Value per Share, Annual Investment Return and Total Return Since Inception\nOur net asset value per share was $9.14 and $9.11 on December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. After considering (i) the overall changes in net asset value per share, (ii) paid distributions of approximately $0.7316 per share during the year ended December 31, 2017, and (iii) the assumed reinvestment of those distributions in accordance with our distribution reinvestment plan then in effect, the total investment return-net asset value was 8.76% for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017. Total investment return-net asset value does not represent and may be higher than an actual return to shareholders because it excludes all sales commissions and dealer manager fees. Total investment return-net asset value is a measure of the change in total value for shareholders who held our common stock at the beginning and end of the period, including distributions paid or payable during the period, and is described further in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nInitial shareholders who subscribed to the offering in December 2012 with an initial investment of $10,000 and an initial purchase price equal to $9.00 per share (public offering price net of sales load) have seen an annualized return of 8.43% and a cumulative total return of 50.45% through December 31, 2017 (see chart below). Initial shareholders who subscribed to the offering in December 2012 with an initial investment of $10,000 and an initial purchase price equal to $10.00 per share (the initial public offering price including sales load) have seen an annualized return of 6.19% and a cumulative total return of 35.40% through December 31, 2017. Over the same time period, the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index, a primary measure of senior debt covering the U.S. leveraged loan market, which currently consists of approximately 1,000 credit facilities throughout numerous industries, recorded an annualized return of 4.16% and a cumulative total return of 22.80%. In addition, the BofA Merrill Lynch US High Yield Index, a primary measure of short-term US dollar denominated below investment grade corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market, recorded an annualized return of 5.79% and a cumulative total return of 32.81% over the same period.\n(1) Cumulative performance: December 17, 2012 to December 31, 2017\nThe calculations for the Growth of $10,000 Initial Investment are based upon (i) an initial investment of $10,000 in our common stock at the beginning of the period, at a share price of $10.00 per share (including sales load) and $9.00 per share (excluding sales load), (ii) assumes reinvestment of monthly distributions in accordance with our distribution reinvestment plan then in effect, (iii) the sale of the entire investment position at the net asset value per share on the last day of the period, and (iv) the distributions declared and payable to shareholders, if any, on the last day of the period.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe generate cash primarily from the net proceeds from our follow-on continuous public offering and from cash flows from interest, fees and dividends earned from our investments as well as principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. We also employ leverage to seek to enhance our returns as market conditions permit and at the discretion of CIM, but in no event will leverage employed exceed 50% of the value of our total assets, as required by the 1940 Act. We are engaged in a follow-on continuous public offering of shares of our common stock. Our initial continuous public offering commenced on July 2, 2012 and ended on December 31, 2015. Our follow-on continuous public offering commenced on January 25, 2016 and will continue until no later than January 25, 2019. We accept subscriptions on a continuous basis and issue shares at weekly closings at prices that, after deducting selling commissions and dealer manager fees, are at or above our net asset value per share.\nWe will sell our shares on a continuous basis at our latest public offering price of $9.70 per share; however, to the extent that our net asset value fluctuates, we will sell at a price necessary to ensure that shares are sold at a price, after deduction of selling commissions and dealer manager fees, that is above and within 2.5% of net asset value per share.\nSince commencing our initial continuous public offering on July 2, 2012 and through December 31, 2017, we sold 115,781,751 shares of common stock for net proceeds of $1,174,850 at an average price per share of $10.15. The net proceeds include gross proceeds received from reinvested shareholder distributions of $124,132, for which we issued 13,623,777 shares of common stock, and gross proceeds paid for shares of common stock tendered for repurchase of $65,821, for which we repurchased 7,261,847 shares of common stock. Since commencing our initial continuous public offering on July 2, 2012 and through December 31, 2017, sales commissions and dealer manager fees related to the sale of our common stock were $64,460 and $31,982, respectively.\nAs of March 8, 2018, we sold 115,468,781 shares of common stock for net proceeds of $1,172,457 at an average price per share of $10.15. The net proceeds include gross proceeds received from reinvested shareholder distributions of $130,958, for which we issued 14,369,911 shares of common stock, and gross proceeds paid for shares of common stock tendered for repurchase of $84,199, for which we repurchased 9,276,383 shares of common stock. Since commencing our initial continuous public offering on July 2, 2012 and through March 8, 2018, sales commissions and dealer manager fees related to the sale of our common stock were $64,649 and $32,147, respectively.\nThe net proceeds from our follow-on continuous public offering will be invested primarily in cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements and high-quality debt instruments maturing in one year or less prior to being invested in debt securities of private U.S. middle-market companies.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had $206,547 and $70,498 in short term investments, respectively, invested in a fund that primarily invests in U.S. government securities.\nCitibank Credit Facility\nAs of December 31, 2017 and March 8, 2018, our outstanding borrowings under the Amended Citibank Credit Facility were $324,542 and the aggregate unfunded principal amount in connection with the Amended Citibank Credit Facility was $458. For a detailed discussion of our Amended Citibank Credit Facility, refer to Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nJPM Credit Facility\nAs of December 31, 2017 and March 8, 2018, our outstanding borrowings under the Amended JPM Credit Facility were $224,423 and the aggregate unfunded principal amount in connection with the Amended JPM Credit Facility was $577.

For a detailed discussion of our UBS Facility, refer to Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nMS Credit Facility\nAs of December 31, 2017 and March 8, 2018, we had no outstanding borrowings under the MS Credit Facility and the aggregate unfunded principal amount in connection with the MS Credit Facility was $200,000. For a detailed discussion of our MS Credit Facility, refer to Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nUnfunded Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2017 and March 8, 2018, our unfunded commitments amounted to $48,259 and $68,150, respectively. For a detailed discussion of our unfunded commitments, refer to Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nRIC Status and Distributions\nPrior to the refinancing of the TRS, our total investment portfolio included loans and other securities on our consolidated balance sheets and loans underlying the TRS. Accordingly, we treated net interest and other income earned on all investments, including the loans underlying the TRS, as a component of investment company taxable income when determining our sources of distributions. The sources of our distributions for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Investment Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Return Swap Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Investment Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Investment Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Return Swap Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Investment Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gains from the sale of assets(1)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) For the year ended December 31, 2017, we distributed long-term capital gains of $927. We distributed long-term capital gains of $906 for the year ended December 31, 2016. \n (2) During the year ended December 31, 2016, we realized losses of $1,030 in our total return swap portfolio, which were not deductible on a tax-basis until 2017. \nFor an additional discussion of our RIC status and distributions, refer to Note 2 and Note 5, respectively, of our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion of certain recent accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, we also utilize available information, including our past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming our estimates and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. Actual results may differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses.\nValuation of Portfolio Investments\nThe value of our assets is determined quarterly and at such other times that an event occurs that materially affects the valuation. The valuation is made pursuant to Section 2(a)(41) of the 1940 Act, which requires that we value our assets as follows: (i) the market price for those securities for which a market quotation is readily available, and (ii) for all other securities and assets, at fair value, as determined in good faith by our board of directors. As a BDC, Section 2(a)(41) of the 1940 Act requires the board of directors to determine in good faith the fair value of portfolio securities for which a market price is not readily available, and it does so in conjunction with the application of our valuation procedures by CIM.\nThere is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each asset while employing a valuation process that is consistently followed. Determinations of fair value involve subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations in our consolidated financial statements.\nValuation Methods\nWith respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, we undertake a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\n \u2022 our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by certain of CIM's investment professionals and certain members of its management team, with such valuation taking into account information received from various sources, including independent valuation firms, if applicable; \n \u2022 preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with CIM's valuation committee; \n \u2022 CIM's valuation committee reviews the preliminary valuation, and, if applicable, delivers such preliminary valuation to an independent valuation firm for its review; \n \u2022 CIM's valuation committee, or its designee, and, if appropriate, the relevant investment professionals meet with the independent valuation firm to discuss the preliminary valuation; \n \u2022 designated members of CIM's management team respond and supplement the preliminary valuation to reflect any comments provided by the independent valuation firm; \n \u2022 our audit committee meets with members of CIM's management team and the independent valuation firm to discuss the assistance provided and the"}
