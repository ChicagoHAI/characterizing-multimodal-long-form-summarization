Our accredited institutions - Colorado Technical University ( CTU\u201d) and the American InterContinental University System ( AIU\u201d) - provide degree programs through the master's or doctoral level as well as associate and bachelor's levels. Our universities offer students industry-relevant and career-focused academic programs that are designed to meet the educational needs of today's busy adults. CTU and AIU continue to show innovation in higher education, advancing personalized learning technologies like their intellipath\u00ae learning platform and using data analytics and technology to support students and enhance learning. Perdoceo is committed to providing quality education that closes the gap between learners who seek to advance their careers and employers needing a qualified workforce.\nOur reporting segments are determined in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 280 - Segment Reporting and are based upon how the Company analyzes performance and makes decisions. Each segment represents a postsecondary education provider that offers a variety of academic programs. We organize our business across two reporting segments: CTU and AIU (collectively referred to as the University Group\u201d).\nOn March 2, 2020, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Trident University International ( Trident University\u201d), an accredited university offering online undergraduate, master's and doctoral programs with a strong focus on graduate programs. Trident University's operations were brought within the scope of the state licensure, accreditation and Department of Education approval of American InterContinental University, with Trident University relinquishing its accreditor and Department approvals. Trident University's programs are now offered by AIU under the Trident\u201d name. The combined institution continues to serve existing and future students with a broader range of program offerings and resources.\nSee Note 18 Segment Reporting\u201d for a description of each of our current reporting segments along with revenues, operating income and total assets by reporting segment for each of the past three fiscal years.\nRegulatory Environment and Political Uncertainty\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry, which has significant impacts on our business and creates risks and uncertainties. In recent years, Congress, the Department, states, accrediting agencies, the CFPB, the FTC, state attorneys general and the media have scrutinized the for-profit postsecondary education sector. Congressional hearings and roundtable discussions were held regarding various aspects of the education industry and reports were issued that are highly critical of for-profit colleges and universities. A group of influential U.S. senators, consumer advocacy groups and some media outlets have strongly and repeatedly encouraged the Departments of Education, Defense and Veterans Affairs to take action to limit or terminate the participation of for-profit educational institutions, including Perdoceo, in existing tuition assistance programs.\nThe results of the 2020 Presidential and Congressional elections are likely to significantly impact future legislative and regulatory actions affecting our business. A loss or material reduction in Title IV Programs or the amount of student financial aid for which our students are eligible would materially impact our student enrollments and profitability and could impact the continued viability of our business as currently conducted.\nWe encourage you to review Item 1, Business,\u201d and Item 1A, Risk Factors,\u201d to learn more about our highly regulated industry and related risks and uncertainties.\nNote Regarding Non-GAAP measures\nWe believe it is useful to present non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain significant and non-cash items as a means to understand the performance of our core business. As a general matter, we use non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP to help analyze the performance of our core business, assist with preparing the annual operating plan, and measure performance for some forms of compensation. In addition, we believe that non-GAAP financial information is used by analysts and others in the investment community to analyze our historical results and to provide estimates of future performance.\nWe believe certain non-GAAP measures allow us to compare our current operating results with respective historical periods and with the operational performance of other companies in our industry because it does not give effect to potential differences caused by items we do not consider reflective of underlying operating performance, such as restructuring charges and significant legal reserves. In evaluating the use of non-GAAP measures, investors should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments presented below. Our presentation of non-GAAP measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by expenses that are unusual, non-routine or non-recurring. A non-GAAP measure has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for net income, operating income, earnings per diluted share, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with and reported under GAAP or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or as a measure of our liquidity.\nNon-GAAP financial measures, when viewed in a reconciliation to respective GAAP financial measures, provide an additional way of viewing the Company's results of operations and the factors and trends affecting the Company's business. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the respective financial results presented in accordance with GAAP.\n2020 Review\nOur financial results for the year ended December 31, 2020 ( current year\u201d) reflected improvements in revenue, operating income and cash flow from operations as well as both new and total student enrollment growth as compared to the prior year. In addition to underlying organic growth, the financial results for the current year were benefitted by the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Trident University (the Trident acquisition\u201d) in the current year. During the current year we continued to make targeted investments within our student support processes as well as within technological initiatives while executing against our objective of sustainable and responsible growth. We believe these investments positively impacted student experiences, retention and academic outcomes.\nWe completed the Trident acquisition during the first quarter of 2020 and we have continued our efforts to integrate Trident's academic programs along with its students, faculty and staff into AIU's operations. Trident's academic model and its master's and doctoral programs continue within AIU providing a diversification of educational learning models and programs to better serve students' needs. Trident students and faculty will also benefit over time from American InterContinental University's technology investments and operations support.\nTotal student enrollments increased 16.7% as of December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019, supported by an increase in new student enrollments of 20.2% for the current year as compared to the prior year. Total student enrollments for CTU increased by 4.2% as of December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 and new student enrollments increased 7.4% for the current year as compared to the prior year. Total student enrollments for AIU increased by 39.2% as of December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 and new student enrollments increased 37.3% for the current year as compared to the prior year. AIU's enrollment results reflect the Trident acquisition as well as organic student enrollment growth. AIU's enrollment days were\nrelatively comparable for the current year as compared to the prior year for American InterContinental University. Enrollment days attributable to any given quarter are the available days in the quarter during which a prospective student may apply to start school during that quarter.\nThe enrollment growth within both CTU and AIU reflects consistent levels of prospective student interest that were well served by our student enrollment processes. During the year we have also made investments to support remote work arrangements and upgrade our data center to enhance the security, stability and capacity of our IT infrastructure as well as further leveraged and applied our AI technology across a student's academic life cycle which enables us to efficiently serve prospective students and customize our outreach and engagement with current students to help them stay and succeed in school. We have also improved the efficiency and effectiveness of our student recruiting process to identify and attract prospective students that we believe are more likely to succeed in one of our academic programs. We believe our continued focus on student experiences, retention and academic outcomes, including the technology investments we have made, have contributed to positive new and total student enrollment growth.\nFinancial Highlights\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $59.6 million or 9.5% as compared to the prior year, reflecting revenue growth at both CTU and AIU as a result of the positive enrollment results discussed above and, for AIU, the Trident acquisition. Operating income for the current year increased to $142.9 million as compared to operating income of $86.5 million for the prior year. This improvement was primarily driven by reduced legal settlements within the current year as compared to the prior year. The prior year results included $37.1 million of expense related to the FTC and Oregon arbitration matters as compared to no significant legal settlements during the current year. Excluding the impact of the legal settlements, the operating income improvement reflects the revenue growth at CTU and AIU and reduced operating losses within Corporate and Other as well as pandemic-related savings, partially offset with ongoing investments in marketing, academics and other student-serving functions, as well as increased bad debt expense. Lastly, we reported cash provided by operations for the current year of $180.0 million as compared to cash provided by operations of $73.1 million in the prior year. The current year cash provided by operations was driven by the positive operating results at both CTU and AIU and timing of Title IV Program funds received in January 2020, partially offset with a settlement payment related to the Oregon arbitration matter.\nRevenue within our CTU segment increased $13.2 million or 3.4% for 2020 as compared to the prior year reflecting the increase in new and total student enrollments. Operating income for CTU increased by $29.9 million to $138.5 million for the current year as compared to operating income of $108.6 million in the prior year driven by decreased legal settlement expense as well as the increase in revenue for the current year, partially offset with increased expenses relating to marketing and student-serving functions.\nRevenue within our AIU segment increased $46.0 million or 19.5% for 2020 as compared to the prior year driven by the Trident acquisition. Operating income for AIU increased by $14.4 million to $30.8 million for the current year as compared to the prior year driven by the decrease in legal settlement expense as well as the increase in revenue, partially offset with increased expenses related to marketing and student-serving functions, as well as an increase in bad debt expense.\nWithin our Corporate and Other category, operating loss of $26.4 million improved by $12.2 million compared to an operating loss of $38.6 million in the prior year driven by reduced legal settlement expense and a reduction in operating losses associated with our closed campuses. The prior year included $7.1 million of legal settlement expense related to the Oregon arbitration matter as compared to no legal settlement expense in the current year.\nThe Company believes it is useful to present non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude certain significant and non-cash items, as a means to understand the performance of its operations. (See tables below for a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation.) Adjusted operating income for the total company was $159.0 million for the current year as compared to $134.3 million in the prior year with the improvement primarily driven by revenue gowth at both universities, efficiencies within operating processes and pandemic related cost savings partially offset with increased expenses related to student-serving functions and marketing and increased bad debt expense.\nAdjusted operating income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is presented below (dollars in thousands, unless otherwise noted):\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

This contagious outbreak, which has continued to spread, and the related adverse public health developments, including travel restrictions and mandated non-essential business closures, have adversely affected workforces, organizations, customers, economies and financial markets globally, leading to an economic downturn and increased market volatility.\nSince the outbreak, we have made several changes to our business operations in response to the global pandemic. While our universities are primarily online, we have a small portion of our students at campus locations. We transitioned these campus-based students to our online environment with minimal disruptions. Students continue to take classes virtually utilizing our online platform and are proceeding with their academic studies with no major disruption to the level of service they are used to experiencing from our institutions and support staff. We have opened our ground-based campuses for limited campus activities and classes and arranged an appointment process for students to request additional help, if needed, at these campuses.\nAdditionally, we quickly and efficiently transitioned our workforce to a remote work environment. We continue to provide our employees with support and resources during this critical time so that they have the tools and information they need to continue supporting our students. Our benefit programs provide support for employees during the COVID-19 pandemic and leaves are also\navailable to eligible employees through the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), other applicable state leave laws and/or the Company's short-term disability, long-term disability or personal leave benefits.\nBoth our students and our workforce are well supported by our scalable and innovative technology infrastructure which enabled us to make these changes with minimal disruptions to our business operations.\nWe have not experienced any material disruptions to date and our strong balance sheet continues to provide us with the financial stability and flexibility to operate during these unprecedented times. Additionally, we are evaluating options to condense real estate facilities as a result of remote work arrangements along with geographically expanding our recruiting efforts. We continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our university operations for future impacts of a potential worsening of global economic conditions as well as other unanticipated consequences.\nTitle IV Programs\nA significant majority of our students rely on Title IV Programs to finance their education and therefore a significant proportion of our cash receipts come from Title IV Programs. As discussed throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our participation in Title IV Programs subjects us to extensive regulation. Significant resources and management time are devoted to monitoring compliance with this complex regulatory framework. The scrutiny of the for-profit postsecondary education sector and the results of the 2020 Presidential and Congressional elections, including the resulting changes in Department administration and policy objectives, could lead to significant regulatory changes. Regulatory change is also likely to continue to be considered by the states and other governmental and regulatory agencies.\nWe regularly evaluate opportunities to grow and benefit our business, including diversifying our educational offerings to increase the portion of our students who do not rely on Title IV Programs, which reduces the potential impact of future regulatory changes on our business. We will continue to evaluate these opportunities, including acquisition of quality educational institutions and programs and internally developing new programs where the students are less dependent upon Title IV Programs to finance their education, committing additional resources to grow our corporate partnership program and enhancing our efforts to recruit international students for our ground-based campuses following the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe will continue to closely monitor potential regulatory changes while we endeavor to manage our business in a way that enhances our ability to comply with any future regulatory changes. However, depending on the nature of any future regulatory changes, we may be required to alter the manner in which we conduct our business in order to preserve our students' ability to benefit from financial assistance for their education pursuant to Title IV Programs. Any necessary business changes could impact our future operating results and opportunities for growth. Please see Item 1A, Risk Factors - Risks Related to the Highly Regulated Field in Which we Operate,\u201d for more information about the risks and uncertainties relating to our highly regulated industry and potential regulatory changes.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe summary of selected financial data table below should be referenced in connection with a review of the following discussion of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands), including comparisons of our year-over-year performance between these years.

This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in administrative expense, which more than offset increases in advertising and marketing, admissions and bad debt expenses. The administrative expense decreased by 21.8% or $35.5 million primarily due to decreased legal settlement expense as 2019 contained approximately $37.1 million related to the FTC and Oregon arbitration matters whereas there were no significant legal settlements in the current year.\nThe advertising and marketing expense for the current year increased by 9.4% or $12.4 million as compared to the prior year, due to the Trident acquisition and investments made to serve prospective student interest. This increase is aligned with our prospective student interest and supports the positive total student enrollment growth within both CTU and AIU. Admissions expense increased by 6.6% or $6.2 million as compared to the prior year, due to the Trident acquisition as well as increased staffing to support the prospective student interest we are experiencing.\nBad debt expense incurred by each of our segments during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Segment Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Segment Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Segment Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2020 vs 2019 % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 vs 2018 % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bad debt expense by segment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CTU\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,783\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AIU\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,405\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total University Group\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate and Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (76\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total bad debt expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 47,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 43,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBad debt expense increased by 9.4% or $4.1 million for the current year as compared to the prior year, relatively in line with the increase in revenue. CTU's and AIU's bad debt increased by 0.9% or $0.2 million and 19.3% or $3.9 million, respectively, as compared to the prior year. As a percentage of revenue, bad debt for both CTU and AIU was relatively in line with the increase in revenue for the current year. Our student support teams have maintained their focus on financial aid documentation collection and are counseling students through the Title IV process so that they are better prepared to start school. We have also focused on emphasizing employer-paid and other direct-pay education programs such as corporate partnerships as students within these programs typically have lower bad debt expense associated with them.\nOperating Income\nOperating income for the current year increased by 65.3% or $56.5 million as compared to the prior year. The current year improvement was primarily driven by reduced legal settlements as compared to the prior year. The prior year operating results included $37.1 million of legal settlements related to the Oregon arbitration and FTC matters as compared to no significant legal settlements recorded during the current year. Additionally, the operating income for the current year benefitted from an increase in revenue of $59.6 million, reduced operating losses within Corporate and Other and pandemic-related cost savings. These benefits more than offset the increases in academics and student related, advertising and marketing, admissions and bad debt expenses.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a tax provision of $22.5 million which includes a $16.0 million favorable adjustment related to the release of a valuation allowance maintained against the portion of the foreign tax credit carryforward supported by an overall domestic loss account balance and a $0.4 million favorable adjustment associated with the tax effect of stock-based compensation.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a tax provision of $22.4 million, which includes a $1.2 million favorable adjustment associated with the tax effect of stock-based compensation and a $0.5 million net benefit associated with the results of a Florida income tax audit. The 2019 effective tax rate also reflected the deductibility of $29.7 million of the FTC settlement, which is the amount paid for the purpose of restitution. See Note 13 Income Taxes\u201d for further information. For the full year 2021, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 25.5% and 26.5%.\nSEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe summary of segment financial information below should be referenced in connection with a review of the following discussion of our segment results from operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands), including comparisons of our year-over-year performance between these years.

We believe this redesign will improve student experiences and engagement. CTU's academic calendar redesign, along with the previous academic calendar redesign at AIU, may impact the comparability of revenue-earning days and enrollment days as well as future new enrollment results to historical periods and may not be reflective of operating performance and enrollment growth. As a result, we will no longer report new student enrollment results and will focus our discussions on total student enrollment in future quarters.\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2020 vs 2019 % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 vs 2018 % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TOTAL STUDENT ENROLLMENTS:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CTU\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AIU (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total University Group\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2020 vs 2019 % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 vs 2018 % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NEW STUDENT ENROLLMENTS:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CTU\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AIU (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total University Group\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________\n(1) AIU includes new and total student enrollments relating to the Trident acquisition commencing on the March 2, 2020 date of acquisition and as of December 31, 2020.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nCTU. Current year revenue increased by 3.4% or $13.2 million as a result of the total student enrollment growth during 2020. For the year, CTU experienced positive new student enrollment growth of 7.4% supporting a total student enrollment increase of 4.2% as compared to the prior year. We believe this growth was supported by consistent levels of prospective student interest which were well served by CTU's student enrollment processes and technology enhancements.\nCurrent year operating income for CTU increased by 27.5% or $29.9 million as compared to the prior year, primarily due to the increase in revenue discussed above. The current year improvement also benefitted from lower legal settlement expense as compared to the prior year, which included $18.6 million of expense related to the FTC settlement. The increased advertising and marketing, academics and admissions expenses for the current year as compared to the prior year were partially offset with improved operating efficiencies.\nAIU. Current year revenue increased by 19.5% or $46.0 million driven by the Trident acquisition as well as new and total student enrollment growth during 2020. For the year, AIU experienced new student enrollment growth of 37.3% and increased total student enrollments by 39.2% as compared to the prior year. These enrollment results reflect the Trident acquisition as well as organic student enrollment growth driven by consistent levels of prospective student interest that were well served by AIU's student support functions. Enrollment days were relatively comparable for the current year as compared to the prior year for American InterContinental University. Enrollment days attributable to any given quarter are the available days in the quarter during which a prospective student may apply to start school during that quarter.\nCurrent year operating income for AIU increased by 87.8% or $14.4 million as compared to the prior year, driven by the increase in revenue as discussed above, and decreased administrative expense primarily related to lower legal settlement expense in the current year as compared to the prior year, which more than offset the increase in academics, advertising and marketing, admissions and bad debt expenses.\nCorporate and Other. This category includes unallocated costs that are incurred on behalf of the entire company and remaining expenses associated with closed campuses. Total Corporate and Other operating loss for the current year improved by 31.6% or $12.2 million as compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of decreased expenses associated with our closed campuses. Additionally, the prior year included $7.1 million of legal settlement expense related to the Oregon arbitration matter.\nSUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nWe have identified the accounting policies and estimates listed below as those that we believe require management's most subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties. This section should be read in conjunction with Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements which includes a discussion of these and other significant accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue, which is derived primarily from academic programs taught to students who attend our institutions, is generally segregated into two categories: (1) tuition and fees, and (2) other. Tuition and fees represent costs to our students for educational services provided by our institutions. Our institutions charge tuition and fees at varying amounts, depending on the institution, the type of program and specific curriculum. Our institutions bill students a single charge that covers tuition, fees and required program materials, such as textbooks and supplies, which we treat as a single performance obligation. Generally, we bill student tuition at the beginning of each academic term, and recognize the tuition as revenue on a straight-line basis over the academic term, which includes any applicable externship period. As part of a student's course of instruction, certain fees, such as technology fees and graduation fees, are billed to students. These fees are earned over the applicable term and are not considered separate performance obligations.\nRevenue recognition includes assumptions and significant judgments including determination of the appropriate portfolios to assess for meeting the criteria to recognize revenue under ASC Topic 606 as well as the assessment of collectability. These assumptions and significant judgments are based upon our interpretation of accounting guidance and historical experience. Although management believes these assumptions and significant judgments to be reasonable, actual amounts may differ if historical experience is not reflective of future results.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe extend unsecured credit to a portion of the students who are enrolled at our institutions for tuition and certain other educational costs. Based upon past experience and judgment, we establish an allowance for credit losses with respect to student receivables which we estimate will ultimately not be collectible. As such, our results from operations only reflect the amount of revenue that is estimated to be reasonably collectible. Our standard student receivable allowance is based on an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses for student receivables. Our estimation methodology considers a number of quantitative and qualitative factors that, based on our collection experience, we believe have an impact on our repayment risk and ability to collect student receivables. These factors include, but are not limited to: internal repayment history, changes in the current economic, legislative or regulatory environments, internal cash collection forecasts and the ability to complete the federal financial aid process with the student. These factors are monitored and assessed on a regular basis. Overall, our allowance estimation process for student receivables is validated by trending analysis and comparing estimated and actual performance.\nWe monitor our collections and write-off experience to assess whether or not adjustments to our allowance percentage estimates are necessary. Changes in trends in any of the factors that we believe impact the collection of our student receivables, as noted above, or modifications to our collection practices or other related policies may impact our estimate of our allowance for credit losses and our results from operations.\nA one percentage point change in our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of gross earned student receivables from continuing operations as of December 31, 2020 would have resulted in a change in pretax income from continuing operations of $0.9 million during the year then ended.\nBecause a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from Title IV Programs, any legislative or regulatory action that significantly reduces the funding available under Title IV Programs, or the ability of our students or institutions to participate in Title IV Programs, would likely have a material impact on the realizability of our receivables.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over fair market value of identifiable net assets acquired through business purchases. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350 - Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, we review goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis by applying a fair-value-based test. In evaluating the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill, we must make assumptions regarding the fair value of our reporting units, as defined under FASB ASC Topic 350. Our reporting units that have goodwill balances remaining as of December 31, 2020 are CTU and AIU. Goodwill is evaluated by comparing the book value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, with its fair value, as determined by a combination of income and market approach valuation methodologies ( quantitative assessment\u201d). If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered to be impaired. The amount of impairment loss is equal to the excess of the book value of the goodwill over the fair\nvalue of goodwill. In certain cases, a qualitative assessment may be used to determine if it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value and if the quantitative assessment is needed.\nWhen performing a quantitative assessment for the annual review of goodwill balances for impairment, we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units based on projected future operating results and cash flows, market assumptions and/or comparative market multiple methods. Determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions based on an evaluation of a number of factors, such as marketplace participants, relative market share, new student interest, student retention, future expansion or contraction expectations, amount and timing of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Projected future operating results and cash flows used for valuation purposes do reflect improvements relative to recent historical periods with respect to, among other things, modest revenue growth and operating margins. Although we believe our projected future operating results and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values are based on reasonable assumptions, historically projected operating results and cash flows have not always been achieved. The failure of one of our reporting units to achieve projected operating results and cash flows in the near term or long term may reduce the estimated fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value and result in the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge. Significant management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. In addition to cash flow estimates, our valuations are sensitive to the rate used to discount cash flows and future growth assumptions. These assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors,\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe did not record any goodwill impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2020. The reporting units with remaining goodwill as of December 31, 2020 are CTU and AIU which together had $118.3 million of goodwill remaining. Based on the quantitative fair value analysis performed as of October 1, 2020, the fair values of our CTU and AIU reporting units exceeded their carrying values by $458.4 million and $116.7 million (fair value as a percentage of carrying value for these reporting units of 904% and 229%), respectively.\nIntangible assets include indefinite-lived and definite-lived assets and are recorded at fair market value upon acquisition. In the year of acquisition, intangible assets, including student relationships, course curriculum and trade names reflect significant judgments made to estimate the fair value and useful life, including future cash flows, forecasts of future revenues and contributory asset charges. Intangible assets are reviewed quarterly for impairment if a triggering event is identified, and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed on an annual basis for impairment.\nSee Note 10 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to the income tax laws of the U.S. and various state and local jurisdictions. These tax laws are complex and subject to interpretation. As a result, significant judgments and interpretations are required in determining our income tax provisions (benefits) and evaluating our uncertain tax positions.\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740 - Income Taxes. Topic 740 requires the recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities based upon the income tax consequences of temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax reporting by applying enacted statutory income tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. Topic 740 also requires that deferred income tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized.\nIn assessing the need for a valuation allowance and/or release of a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. Topic 740 provides that important factors in determining whether a deferred tax asset will be realized are whether there has been sufficient taxable income in recent years and whether sufficient taxable income is expected in future years in order to use the deferred tax asset. In evaluating the realizability of deferred income tax assets, we consider, among other things, historical levels of taxable income along with possible sources of future taxable income, which include: the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary reporting differences, the existence of taxable income in prior carryback year(s), the expected impact of tax planning strategies that may be implemented to prevent the potential loss of future income tax benefits, expected future taxable income and earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the future deductible amount, coupled with evidence indicating the loss is not a continuing condition. Changes in, among other things, income tax legislation, statutory income tax rates, or future taxable income levels could materially impact our valuation of income tax assets and liabilities and could cause our income tax provision to vary significantly among financial reporting periods. If, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized, we record a valuation allowance, or release all or a portion of the valuation allowance if it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets are expected to be realized. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. A high degree of judgment is required to determine if, and the extent to which, valuation allowances should be recorded against deferred tax assets.\nTopic 740 further clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity's financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. Topic 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.\nLIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAs of December 31, 2020, cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale short-term investments ( cash balances\u201d) totaled $410.4 million. Restricted cash as of December 31, 2020 was $4.0 million and relates to amounts held in an escrow account to secure post-closing indemnification obligations of the seller pursuant to the Trident acquisition. Our cash flows from operating activities have historically been adequate to fulfill our liquidity requirements. We have historically financed our operating activities, organic growth and acquisitions primarily through cash generated from operations and existing cash balances. We generated cash in 2020 as a result of improved operating performance within our University Group and reduced operating losses associated with closed campuses and expect to continue to do so in 2021. We anticipate that we will be able to satisfy the cash requirements associated with, among other things, our working capital needs, capital expenditures and lease commitments through at least the next 12 months primarily with cash generated by operations and existing cash balances.\nOur credit agreement allows us to borrow up to a maximum amount of $50.0 million and is scheduled to mature on January 20, 2022. The credit agreement contains customary affirmative, negative and financial maintenance covenants, including a requirement to maintain a balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in our domestic accounts with the bank of at least $50.0 million at all times. Amounts borrowed under the credit agreement are required to be 100% secured with deposits of cash and marketable securities with the bank. Under the credit agreement, the Company's ability to make restricted payments, including payments in connection with an acquisition or a repurchase of shares of our common stock, is subject to limitations. Taking into consideration restricted payments already made by the Company during the term of the credit agreement, the Company may make up to an additional $184.4 million of restricted payments through January 20, 2022.\nWe maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy that focuses on maintaining a strong balance sheet and adequate liquidity, while (i) prudently investing in organic growth projects at our universities, such as student-serving initiatives and new academic program development, and (ii) evaluating diverse strategies to enhance stockholder value, including acquisitions of quality educational institutions or programs and share repurchases. Ultimately, our goal is to deploy resources in a way that drives long term stockholder value while supporting and enhancing the academic value of our institutions.\nOn November 4, 2019, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a stock repurchase program which authorizes the Company to repurchase up to $50.0 million of our common stock from time to time depending on market conditions and other considerations. The program expires on December 31, 2021. Since the November 4, 2019 inception date, the Company repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares for $21.7 million, of which approximately 1.3 million shares of our common stock were repurchased for approximately $17.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. See Note 15 Stock Repurchase Program\u201d for more information about this stock repurchase program.\nOn March 2, 2020, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Trident University. The final purchase price for the acquisition, including post-closing purchase price and working capital adjustments, was $43.8 million, based in part on Trident University's financial results measured in terms of its revenue and EBITDA (as determined pursuant to the purchase agreement for the transaction) during the 12-month period ended December 31, 2019. The initial cash payment of $38.1 million was made on the date of acquisition. As mentioned above, approximately $4.0 million of this amount is held in an escrow account to secure post-closing indemnification obligations of the seller pursuant to the purchase agreement, and is reflected as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. We paid an additional $5.7 million during July 2020 related to the final post-closing purchase price and working capital adjustments. The purchase price was funded with the Company's available cash balances.\nThe discussion above reflects management's expectations regarding liquidity; however, as a result of the significance of the Title IV Program funds received by our students, we are highly dependent on these funds to operate our business. Any reduction in the level of Title IV funds that our students are eligible to receive or any impact on timing or our ability to receive Title IV Program funds, or any requirement to post a significant letter of credit to the Department, may have a significant impact on our operations and our financial condition. In addition, our financial performance is dependent on the level of student enrollments which could be impacted by external factors. See Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nSources and Uses of Cash\nOperating Cash Flows\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, net cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $180.0 million and $73.1 million, respectively. The increase in cash flow from operations as compared to the prior year is primarily driven by revenue growth at both CTU and AIU and reduction of losses at our closed campuses. Additionally, the current year operating cash flows were\npositively impacted by the timing of receipt of approximately $39.3 million of Title IV funds. These funds were received in January 2020 instead of the fourth quarter of 2019.\nOur primary source of cash flows from operating activities is tuition collected from our students. Our students derive the ability to pay tuition costs through the use of a variety of funding sources, including, among others, federal loan and grant programs, state grant programs, private loans and grants, institutional payment plans, private and institutional scholarships and cash payments. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, approximately 80% and 79% of our institutions' aggregate cash receipts from tuition payments came from Title IV Program funding. This percentage differs from the Title IV Program percentage calculated under the 90-10 Rule due to the treatment of certain funding types and certain student level limitations on what and how much to count as prescribed under the rule.\nFor further discussion of Title IV Program funding and other funding sources for our students, see Item 1, Business - Student Financial Aid and Related Federal Regulation.\u201d\nOur primary uses of cash to support our operating activities include, among other things, cash paid and benefits provided to our employees for services, to vendors for products and services, to lessors for rents and operating costs related to leased facilities, to suppliers for textbooks and other institution supplies, and to federal, state and local governments for income and other taxes.\nInvesting Cash Flows\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash flows used in investing activities totaled $165.9 million compared to net cash flows provided by investing activities of $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nPurchases and Sales of Available-for-Sale Investments. Purchases and sales of available-for-sale investments resulted in a net cash outflow of $116.4 million and a net cash inflow of $13.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nCapital Expenditures. Capital expenditures increased to $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Capital expenditures represented approximately 1% of total revenue during each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. For the year ending December 31, 2021, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 1.5% to 2.0% of revenue.\nFinancing Cash Flows\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, net cash flows used in financing activities totaled $13.1 million and $4.8 million, respectively.\nPayments of employee tax associated with stock compensation. Payments of employee tax associated with stock compensation were $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nRepurchase of Stock. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased 1.3 million shares of our common stock for approximately $17.9 million at an average price of $13.53 per share as compared to 0.2 million shares of common stock repurchased for $3.9 million at an average price of $16.49 per share for the year ended December 31, 2019. Repurchases of stock during 2020 and 2019 were funded by cash generated from operating activities and existing cash balances. See Part II, Item 5 for more information.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2020 future minimum cash payments due under contractual obligations for our non-cancelable operating lease

intangible assets is attributable to the Trident acquisition.\nDeferred income tax assets, net: The decrease reflects the usage of deferred tax assets associated with the offset of income taxes payable, which was partially offset by the release of a valuation allowance previously maintained against the portion of the foreign tax credit carryforward supported by an overall domestic loss account balance.\nDeferred revenue: The increase is driven by an increase within AIU related to the timing of the term start dates as well as the Trident acquisition.\nOther non-current liabilities: The increase is driven by an escrow liability of $4.0 million and a reserve of $1.9 million for potential loan discharges associated with the Trident acquisition.\nTreasury stock: The increase is driven primarily by the repurchase of the Company's common stock during the current year for approximately $17.9 million.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 4 Recent Accounting

The terms institution\u201d and university\u201d refer to an individual, branded, for-profit educational institution, owned by us and including its campus locations. The term campus\u201d refers to an individual main or branch campus operated by one of our institutions.\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The MD&A is intended to help investors understand the results of operations, financial condition and present business environment. The MD&A is organized as follows:\n \u2022 Overview \n \u2022 Consolidated Results of Operations \n \u2022 Segment Results of Operations \n \u2022 Summary of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n \u2022 Liquidity, Financial Position and Capital Resources \nOVERVIEW\nOur academic institutions offer a quality postsecondary education primarily online to a diverse student population, along with campus-based and blended learning programs. Our accredited institutions - Colorado Technical University ( CTU\u201d) and the American InterContinental University System ( AIU\u201d) - provide degree programs through the master's or doctoral level as well as associate and bachelor's levels. Our universities offer students industry-relevant and career-focused academic programs that are designed to meet the educational needs of today's busy adults. CTU and AIU continue to show innovation in higher education, advancing personalized learning technologies like their intellipath\u00ae learning platform and using data analytics and technology to support students and enhance learning. Perdoceo is committed to providing quality education that closes the gap between learners who seek to advance their careers and employers needing a qualified workforce.\nOur reporting segments are determined in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 280 - Segment Reporting and are based upon how the Company analyzes performance and makes decisions. Each segment represents a postsecondary education provider that offers a variety of academic programs. We organize our business across two reporting segments: CTU and AIU (collectively referred to as the University Group\u201d).\nOn March 2, 2020, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Trident University International ( Trident University\u201d), an accredited university offering online undergraduate, master's and doctoral programs with a strong focus on graduate programs. Trident University's operations were brought within the scope of the state licensure, accreditation and Department of Education approval of American InterContinental University, with Trident University relinquishing its accreditor and Department approvals. Trident University's programs are now offered by AIU under the Trident\u201d name. The combined institution continues to serve existing and future students with a broader range of program offerings and resources.\nSee Note 18 Segment Reporting\u201d for a description of each of our current reporting segments along with revenues, operating income and total assets by reporting segment for each of the past three fiscal years.\nRegulatory Environment and Political Uncertainty\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry, which has significant impacts on our business and creates risks and uncertainties. In recent years, Congress, the Department, states, accrediting agencies, the CFPB, the FTC, state attorneys general and the media have scrutinized the for-profit postsecondary education sector. Congressional hearings and roundtable discussions were held regarding various aspects of the education industry and reports were issued that are highly critical of for-profit colleges and universities. A group of influential U.S. senators, consumer advocacy groups and some media outlets have strongly and repeatedly encouraged the Departments of Education, Defense and Veterans Affairs to take action to limit or terminate the participation of for-profit educational institutions, including Perdoceo, in existing tuition assistance programs.\nThe results of the 2020 Presidential and Congressional elections are likely to significantly impact future legislative and regulatory actions affecting our business. A loss or material reduction in Title IV Programs or the amount of student financial aid for which our students are eligible would materially impact our student enrollments and profitability and could impact the continued viability of our business as currently conducted.\nWe encourage you to review Item 1, Business,\u201d and Item 1A, Risk Factors,\u201d to learn more about our highly regulated industry and related risks and uncertainties.\nNote Regarding Non-GAAP measures\nWe believe it is useful to present non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain significant and non-cash items as a means to understand the performance of our core business. As a general matter, we use non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP to help analyze the performance of our core business, assist with preparing the annual operating plan, and measure performance for some forms of compensation. In addition, we believe that non-GAAP financial information is used by analysts and others in the investment community to analyze our historical results and to provide estimates of future performance.\nWe believe certain non-GAAP measures allow us to compare our current operating results with respective historical periods and with the operational performance of other companies in our industry because it does not give effect to potential differences caused by items we do not consider reflective of underlying operating performance, such as restructuring charges and significant legal reserves. In evaluating the use of non-GAAP measures, investors should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments presented below. Our presentation of non-GAAP measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by expenses that are unusual, non-routine or non-recurring. A non-GAAP measure has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for net income, operating income, earnings per diluted share, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with and reported under GAAP or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or as a measure of our liquidity.\nNon-GAAP financial measures, when viewed in a reconciliation to respective GAAP financial measures, provide an additional way of viewing the Company's results of operations and the factors and trends affecting the Company's business. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the respective financial results presented in accordance with GAAP.\n2020 Review\nOur financial results for the year ended December 31, 2020 ( current year\u201d) reflected improvements in revenue, operating income and cash flow from operations as well as both new and total student enrollment growth as compared to the prior year. In addition to underlying organic growth, the financial results for the current year were benefitted by the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Trident University (the Trident acquisition\u201d) in the current year. During the current year we continued to make targeted investments within our student support processes as well as within technological initiatives while executing against our objective of sustainable and responsible growth. We believe these investments positively impacted student experiences, retention and academic outcomes.\nWe completed the Trident acquisition during the first quarter of 2020 and we have continued our efforts to integrate Trident's academic programs along with its students, faculty and staff into AIU's operations. Trident's academic model and its master's and doctoral programs continue within AIU providing a diversification of educational learning models and programs to better serve students' needs. Trident students and faculty will also benefit over time from American InterContinental University's technology investments and operations support.\nTotal student enrollments increased 16.7% as of December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019, supported by an increase in new student enrollments of 20.2% for the current year as compared to the prior year. Total student enrollments for CTU increased by 4.2% as of December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 and new student enrollments increased 7.4% for the current year as compared to the prior year. Total student enrollments for AIU increased by 39.2% as of December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 and new student enrollments increased 37.3% for the current year as compared to the prior year. AIU's enrollment results reflect the Trident acquisition as well as organic student enrollment growth. AIU's enrollment days were\nrelatively comparable for the current year as compared to the prior year for American InterContinental University. Enrollment days attributable to any given quarter are the available days in the quarter during which a prospective student may apply to start school during that quarter.\nThe enrollment growth within both CTU and AIU reflects consistent levels of prospective student interest that were well served by our student enrollment processes. During the year we have also made investments to support remote work arrangements and upgrade our data center to enhance the security, stability and capacity of our IT infrastructure as well as further leveraged and applied our AI technology across a student's academic life cycle which enables us to efficiently serve prospective students and customize our outreach and engagement with current students to help them stay and succeed in school. We have also improved the efficiency and effectiveness of our student recruiting process to identify and attract prospective students that we believe are more likely to succeed in one of our academic programs. We believe our continued focus on student experiences, retention and academic outcomes, including the technology investments we have made, have contributed to positive new and total student enrollment growth.\nFinancial Highlights\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $59.6 million or 9.5% as compared to the prior year, reflecting revenue growth at both CTU and AIU as a result of the positive enrollment results discussed above and, for AIU, the Trident acquisition. Operating income for the current year increased to $142.9 million as compared to operating income of $86.5 million for the prior year. This improvement was primarily driven by reduced legal settlements within the current year as compared to the prior year. The prior year results included $37.1 million of expense related to the FTC and Oregon arbitration matters as compared to no significant legal settlements during the current year. Excluding the impact of the legal settlements, the operating income improvement reflects the revenue growth at CTU and AIU and reduced operating losses within Corporate and Other as well as pandemic-related savings, partially offset with ongoing investments in marketing, academics and other student-serving functions, as well as increased bad debt expense. Lastly, we reported cash provided by operations for the current year of $180.0 million as compared to cash provided by operations of $73.1 million in the prior year. The current year cash provided by operations was driven by the positive operating results at both CTU and AIU and timing of Title IV Program funds received in January 2020, partially offset with a settlement payment related to the Oregon arbitration matter.\nRevenue within our CTU segment increased $13.2 million or 3.4% for 2020 as compared to the prior year reflecting the increase in new and total student enrollments. Operating income for CTU increased by $29.9 million to $138.5 million for the current year as compared to operating income of $108.6 million in the prior year driven by decreased legal settlement expense as well as the increase in revenue for the current year, partially offset with increased expenses relating to marketing and student-serving functions.\nRevenue within our AIU segment increased $46.0 million or 19.5% for 2020 as compared to the prior year driven by the Trident acquisition. Operating income for AIU increased by $14.4 million to $30.8 million for the current year as compared to the prior year driven by the decrease in legal settlement expense as well as the increase in revenue, partially offset with increased expenses related to marketing and student-serving functions, as well as an increase in bad debt expense.\nWithin our Corporate and Other category, operating loss of $26.4 million improved by $12.2 million compared to an operating loss of $38.6 million in the prior year driven by reduced legal settlement expense and a reduction in operating losses associated with our closed campuses. The prior year included $7.1 million of legal settlement expense related to the Oregon arbitration matter as compared to no legal settlement expense in the current year.\nThe Company believes it is useful to present non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude certain significant and non-cash items, as a means to understand the performance of its operations. (See tables below for a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation.) Adjusted operating income for the total company was $159.0 million for the current year as compared to $134.3 million in the prior year with the improvement primarily driven by revenue gowth at both universities, efficiencies within operating processes and pandemic related cost savings partially offset with increased expenses related to student-serving functions and marketing and increased bad debt expense.\nAdjusted operating income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is presented below (dollars in thousands, unless otherwise noted):\n\n___________________________\n (1) Asset impairment relates to a right of use asset for a vacated facility for a closed campus for which the sublease income was deemed no longer recoverable. \n (2) Lease expenses for vacated space include both fixed and variable lease costs offset with sublease income for closed campuses. \n (3) Significant legal settlements relate to the FTC and Oregon arbitration matters recorded during 2019. \n (4) Amortization for acquired intangible assets relates to definite-lived intangible assets associated with the Trident acquisition. \n (5) The tax effect of adjustments was calculated by multiplying the pre-tax adjustments with a tax rate of 25%. This tax rate is intended to reflect federal and state taxable jurisdictions as well as the nature of the adjustments. There is no tax effect applied to the adjustment related to the release of the valuation allowance as this is an adjustment for income tax. \n (6) This relates to the release of a valuation allowance in the amount of $16.0 million as a result of the current determination that it is more likely than not that the Company will utilize its deferred tax assets associated with the portion of the foreign tax credit carryforward supported by an overall domestic loss account balance. \n (7) 2020 results include the Trident acquisition commencing on the March 2, 2020 date of acquisition. \nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus outbreak ( COVID-19\u201d) a global pandemic. This contagious outbreak, which has continued to spread, and the related adverse public health developments, including travel restrictions and mandated non-essential business closures, have adversely affected workforces, organizations, customers, economies and financial markets globally, leading to an economic downturn and increased market volatility.\nSince the outbreak, we have made several changes to our business operations in response to the global pandemic. While our universities are primarily online, we have a small portion of our students at campus locations. We transitioned these campus-based students to our online environment with minimal disruptions. Students continue to take classes virtually utilizing our online platform and are proceeding with their academic studies with no major disruption to the level of service they are used to experiencing from our institutions and support staff. We have opened our ground-based campuses for limited campus activities and classes and arranged an appointment process for students to request additional help, if needed, at these campuses.\nAdditionally, we quickly and efficiently transitioned our workforce to a remote work environment. We continue to provide our employees with support and resources during this critical time so that they have the tools and information they need to continue supporting our students. Our benefit programs provide support for employees during the COVID-19 pandemic and leaves are also\navailable to eligible employees through the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), other applicable state leave laws and/or the Company's short-term disability, long-term disability or personal leave benefits.\nBoth our students and our workforce are well supported by our scalable and innovative technology infrastructure which enabled us to make these changes with minimal disruptions to our business operations.\nWe have not experienced any material disruptions to date and our strong balance sheet continues to provide us with the financial stability and flexibility to operate during these unprecedented times. Additionally, we are evaluating options to condense real estate facilities as a result of remote work arrangements along with geographically expanding our recruiting efforts. We continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our university operations for future impacts of a potential worsening of global economic conditions as well as other unanticipated consequences.\nTitle IV Programs\nA significant majority of our students rely on Title IV Programs to finance their education and therefore a significant proportion of our cash receipts come from Title IV Programs. As discussed throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our participation in Title IV Programs subjects us to extensive regulation. Significant resources and management time are devoted to monitoring compliance with this complex regulatory framework. The scrutiny of the for-profit postsecondary education sector and the results of the 2020 Presidential and Congressional elections, including the resulting changes in Department administration and policy objectives, could lead to significant regulatory changes. Regulatory change is also likely to continue to be considered by the states and other governmental and regulatory agencies.\nWe regularly evaluate opportunities to grow and benefit our business, including diversifying our educational offerings to increase the portion of our students who do not rely on Title IV Programs, which reduces the potential impact of future regulatory changes on our business. We will continue to evaluate these opportunities, including acquisition of quality educational institutions and programs and internally developing new programs where the students are less dependent upon Title IV Programs to finance their education, committing additional resources to grow our corporate partnership program and enhancing our efforts to recruit international students for our ground-based campuses following the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe will continue to closely monitor potential regulatory changes while we endeavor to manage our business in a way that enhances our ability to comply with any future regulatory changes. However, depending on the nature of any future regulatory changes, we may be required to alter the manner in which we conduct our business in order to preserve our students' ability to benefit from financial assistance for their education pursuant to Title IV Programs. Any necessary business changes could impact our future operating results and opportunities for growth. Please see Item 1A, Risk Factors - Risks Related to the Highly Regulated Field in Which we Operate,\u201d for more information about the risks and uncertainties relating to our highly regulated industry and potential regulatory changes.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe summary of selected financial data table below should be referenced in connection with a review of the following discussion of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands), including comparisons of our year-over-year performance between these years. Please refer to Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for a discussion of our results for the year ended December 31, 2018, as well as the year-over-year comparison of our 2019 financial performance to 2018.\n\n_______________\n (1) Educational services and facilities expense includes costs attributable to the educational activities of our universities, including: salaries and benefits of faculty, academic administrators and student support personnel, and costs of educational supplies and facilities, such as rents on leased facilities and certain costs of establishing and maintaining computer laboratories. Also included in educational services and facilities expense are rents on leased administrative facilities, such as our corporate headquarters, and costs of other goods and services provided by our campuses, including costs of textbooks and laptop computers. \n (2) General and administrative expense includes salaries and benefits of personnel in corporate and campus administration, marketing, admissions, information technology, financial aid, accounting, human resources, legal and compliance. Other expenses within this expense category include costs of advertising and production of marketing materials and bad debt expense. \nYear Ended December 31, 2020 as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nRevenue\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 ( current year\u201d) increased 9.5% or $59.6 million, primarily driven by the Trident acquisition. The revenue growth was also supported by a 16.7% increase in total student enrollments and various operating initiatives that contributed to an increase of 20.2% in new student enrollments. CTU's and AIU's new and total student enrollments are discussed in the segment results of operations section below.\nEducational Services and Facilities Expense (dollars in thousands)\n\nThe educational services and facilities expense for the current year increased by 9.6% or $9.8 million as compared to the prior year. Academics and student related costs increased by 15.4% or $12.1 million for the current year as compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of the Trident acquisition. Additionally, we invested in our faculty and advising functions during 2020 as our\nstudent enrollments increased. Occupancy expenses for the current year improved by 9.8% or $2.3 million as compared to the prior year, primarily driven by decreases associated with our closed campuses as those leased facilities reach the end of their lease terms.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense (dollars in thousands)\n\nThe general and administrative expense for the current year decreased by 3.0% or $12.9 million as compared to the prior year. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in administrative expense, which more than offset increases in advertising and marketing, admissions and bad debt expenses. The administrative expense decreased by 21.8% or $35.5 million primarily due to decreased legal settlement expense as 2019 contained approximately $37.1 million related to the FTC and Oregon arbitration matters whereas there were no significant legal settlements in the current year.\nThe advertising and marketing expense for the current year increased by 9.4% or $12.4 million as compared to the prior year, due to the Trident acquisition and investments made to serve prospective student interest. This increase is aligned with our prospective student interest and supports the positive total student enrollment growth within both CTU and AIU. Admissions expense increased by 6.6% or $6.2 million as compared to the prior year, due to the Trident acquisition as well as increased staffing to support the prospective student interest we are experiencing.\nBad debt expense incurred by each of our segments during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\nBad debt expense increased by 9.4% or $4.1 million for the current year as compared to the prior year, relatively in line with the increase in revenue. CTU's and AIU's bad debt increased by 0.9% or $0.2 million and 19.3% or $3.9 million, respectively, as compared to the prior year. As a percentage of revenue, bad debt for both CTU and AIU was relatively in line with the increase in revenue for the current year. Our student support teams have maintained their focus on financial aid documentation collection and are counseling students through the Title IV process so that they are better prepared to start school. We have also focused on emphasizing employer-paid and other direct-pay education programs such as corporate partnerships as students within these programs typically have lower bad debt expense associated with them.\nOperating Income\nOperating income for the current year increased by 65.3% or $56.5 million as compared to the prior year. The current year improvement was primarily driven by reduced legal settlements as compared to the prior year. The prior year operating results included $37.1 million of legal settlements related to the Oregon arbitration and FTC matters as compared to no significant legal settlements recorded during the current year. Additionally, the operating income for the current year benefitted from an increase in revenue of $59.6 million, reduced operating losses within Corporate and Other and pandemic-related cost savings. These benefits more than offset the increases in academics and student related, advertising and marketing, admissions and bad debt expenses.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a tax provision of $22.5 million which includes a $16.0 million favorable adjustment related to the release of a valuation allowance maintained against the portion of the foreign tax credit carryforward supported by an overall domestic loss account balance and a $0.4 million favorable adjustment associated with the tax effect of stock-based compensation.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a tax provision of $22.4 million, which includes a $1.2 million favorable adjustment associated with the tax effect of stock-based compensation and a $0.5 million net benefit associated with the results of a Florida income tax audit. The 2019 effective tax rate also reflected the deductibility of $29.7 million of the FTC settlement, which is the amount paid for the purpose of restitution. See Note 13 Income Taxes\u201d for further information. For the full year 2021, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 25.5% and 26.5%.\nSEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe summary of segment financial information below should be referenced in connection with a review of the following discussion of our segment results from operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands), including comparisons of our year-over-year performance between these years. Please refer to Part II Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for a discussion of our results for the year ended December 31, 2018, as well as the year-over-year comparison of our 2019 financial performance to 2018.\n\n______________________\n (1) AIU results of operations include the Trident acquisition commencing on the March 2, 2020 date of acquisition and as of December 31, 2020. \n (2) This category includes amounts that were historically reported within Corporate and Other prior to the segment change as of January 1, 2019, which combined the former All Other campuses segment (which was comprised of campuses being taught out) with Corporate and Other. \n (3) An expense of $18.6 million and $11.4 million was recorded within CTU and AIU, respectively, related to the FTC settlement during 2019. An expense of $7.1 million was recorded within Corporate and Other for our closed campuses related to the Oregon arbitration matter during 2019. \nTotal student enrollments represent all students who are active as of the last day of the reporting period. Active students are defined as those students who are considered in good attendance by participating in class related activities. New student enrollments represent students who have started class at one of our academic institutions during the period, excluding students who were previously active at any point in time within the 365 days prior to the start of their course.\nBeginning in 2021, we are redesigning CTU's academic calendar to strategically place breaks between sessions and provide more opportunities for students to continue with their academic programs. We believe this redesign will improve student experiences and engagement. CTU's academic calendar redesign, along with the previous academic calendar redesign at AIU, may impact the comparability of revenue-earning days and enrollment days as well as future new enrollment results to historical periods and may not be reflective of operating performance and enrollment growth. As a result, we will no longer report new student enrollment results and will focus our discussions on total student enrollment in future quarters.\n\n_______________________\n(1) AIU includes new and total student enrollments relating to the Trident acquisition commencing on the March 2, 2020 date of acquisition and as of December 31, 2020.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nCTU. Current year revenue increased by 3.4% or $13.2 million as a result of the total student enrollment growth during 2020. For the year, CTU experienced positive new student enrollment growth of 7.4% supporting a total student enrollment increase of 4.2% as compared to the prior year. We believe this growth was supported by consistent levels of prospective student interest which were well served by CTU's student enrollment processes and technology enhancements.\nCurrent year operating income for CTU increased by 27.5% or $29.9 million as compared to the prior year, primarily due to the increase in revenue discussed above. The current year improvement also benefitted from lower legal settlement expense as compared to the prior year, which included $18.6 million of expense related to the FTC settlement. The increased advertising and marketing, academics and admissions expenses for the current year as compared to the prior year were partially offset with improved operating efficiencies.\nAIU. Current year revenue increased by 19.5% or $46.0 million driven by the Trident acquisition as well as new and total student enrollment growth during 2020. For the year, AIU experienced new student enrollment growth of 37.3% and increased total student enrollments by 39.2% as compared to the prior year. These enrollment results reflect the Trident acquisition as well as organic student enrollment growth driven by consistent levels of prospective student interest that were well served by AIU's student support functions. Enrollment days were relatively comparable for the current year as compared to the prior year for American InterContinental University. Enrollment days attributable to any given quarter are the available days in the quarter during which a prospective student may apply to start school during that quarter.\nCurrent year operating income for AIU increased by 87.8% or $14.4 million as compared to the prior year, driven by the increase in revenue as discussed above, and decreased administrative expense primarily related to lower legal settlement expense in the current year as compared to the prior year, which more than offset the increase in academics, advertising and marketing, admissions and bad debt expenses.\nCorporate and Other. This category includes unallocated costs that are incurred on behalf of the entire company and remaining expenses associated with closed campuses. Total Corporate and Other operating loss for the current year improved by 31.6% or $12.2 million as compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of decreased expenses associated with our closed campuses. Additionally, the prior year included $7.1 million of legal settlement expense related to the Oregon arbitration matter.\nSUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nWe have identified the accounting policies and estimates listed below as those that we believe require management's most subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties. This section should be read in conjunction with Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements which includes a discussion of these and other significant accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue, which is derived primarily from academic programs taught to students who attend our institutions, is generally segregated into two categories: (1) tuition and fees, and (2) other. Tuition and fees represent costs to our students for educational services provided by our institutions. Our institutions charge tuition and fees at varying amounts, depending on the institution, the type of program and specific curriculum. Our institutions bill students a single charge that covers tuition, fees and required program materials, such as textbooks and supplies, which we treat as a single performance obligation. Generally, we bill student tuition at the beginning of each academic term, and recognize the tuition as revenue on a straight-line basis over the academic term, which includes any applicable externship period. As part of a student's course of instruction, certain fees, such as technology fees and graduation fees, are billed to students. These fees are earned over the applicable term and are not considered separate performance obligations.\nRevenue recognition includes assumptions and significant judgments including determination of the appropriate portfolios to assess for meeting the criteria to recognize revenue under ASC Topic 606 as well as the assessment of collectability. These assumptions and significant judgments are based upon our interpretation of accounting guidance and historical experience. Although management believes these assumptions and significant judgments to be reasonable, actual amounts may differ if historical experience is not reflective of future results.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe extend unsecured credit to a portion of the students who are enrolled at our institutions for tuition and certain other educational costs. Based upon past experience and judgment, we establish an allowance for credit losses with respect to student receivables which we estimate will ultimately not be collectible. As such, our results from operations only reflect the amount of revenue that is estimated to be reasonably collectible. Our standard student receivable allowance is based on an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses for student receivables. Our estimation methodology considers a number of quantitative and qualitative factors that, based on our collection experience, we believe have an impact on our repayment risk and ability to collect student receivables. These factors include, but are not limited to: internal repayment history, changes in the current economic, legislative or regulatory environments, internal cash collection forecasts and the ability to complete the federal financial aid process with the student. These factors are monitored and assessed on a regular basis. Overall, our allowance estimation process for student receivables is validated by trending analysis and comparing estimated and actual performance.\nWe monitor our collections and write-off experience to assess whether or not adjustments to our allowance percentage estimates are necessary. Changes in trends in any of the factors that we believe impact the collection of our student receivables, as noted above, or modifications to our collection practices or other related policies may impact our estimate of our allowance for credit losses and our results from operations.\nA one percentage point change in our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of gross earned student receivables from continuing operations as of December 31, 2020 would have resulted in a change in pretax income from continuing operations of $0.9 million during the year then ended.\nBecause a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from Title IV Programs, any legislative or regulatory action that significantly reduces the funding available under Title IV Programs, or the ability of our students or institutions to participate in Title IV Programs, would likely have a material impact on the realizability of our receivables.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over fair market value of identifiable net assets acquired through business purchases. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350 - Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, we review goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis by applying a fair-value-based test. In evaluating the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill, we must make assumptions regarding the fair value of our reporting units, as defined under FASB ASC Topic 350. Our reporting units that have goodwill balances remaining as of December 31, 2020 are CTU and AIU. Goodwill is evaluated by comparing the book value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, with its fair value, as determined by a combination of income and market approach valuation methodologies ( quantitative assessment\u201d). If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered to be impaired. The amount of impairment loss is equal to the excess of the book value of the goodwill over the fair\nvalue of goodwill. In certain cases, a qualitative assessment may be used to determine if it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value and if the quantitative assessment is needed.\nWhen performing a quantitative assessment for the annual review of goodwill balances for impairment, we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units based on projected future operating results and cash flows, market assumptions and/or comparative market multiple methods. Determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions based on an evaluation of a number of factors, such as marketplace participants, relative market share, new student interest, student retention, future expansion or contraction expectations, amount and timing of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Projected future operating results and cash flows used for valuation purposes do reflect improvements relative to recent historical periods with respect to, among other things, modest revenue growth and operating margins. Although we believe our projected future operating results and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values are based on reasonable assumptions, historically projected operating results and cash flows have not always been achieved. The failure of one of our reporting units to achieve projected operating results and cash flows in the near term or long term may reduce the estimated fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value and result in the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge. Significant management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. In addition to cash flow estimates, our valuations are sensitive to the rate used to discount cash flows and future growth assumptions. These assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors,\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe did not record any goodwill impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2020. The reporting units with remaining goodwill as of December 31, 2020 are CTU and AIU which together had $118.3 million of goodwill remaining. Based on the quantitative fair value analysis performed as of October 1, 2020, the fair values of our CTU and AIU reporting units exceeded their carrying values by $458.4 million and $116.7 million (fair value as a percentage of carrying value for these reporting units of 904% and 229%), respectively.\nIntangible assets include indefinite-lived and definite-lived assets and are recorded at fair market value upon acquisition. In the year of acquisition, intangible assets, including student relationships, course curriculum and trade names reflect significant judgments made to estimate the fair value and useful life, including future cash flows, forecasts of future revenues and contributory asset charges. Intangible assets are reviewed quarterly for impairment if a triggering event is identified, and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed on an annual basis for impairment.\nSee Note 10 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to the income tax laws of the U.S. and various state and local jurisdictions. These tax laws are complex and subject to interpretation. As a result, significant judgments and interpretations are required in determining our income tax provisions (benefits) and evaluating our uncertain tax positions.\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740 - Income Taxes. Topic 740 requires the recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities based upon the income tax consequences of temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax reporting by applying enacted statutory income tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. Topic 740 also requires that deferred income tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized.\nIn assessing the need for a valuation allowance and/or release of a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. Topic 740 provides that important factors in determining whether a deferred tax asset will be realized are whether there has been sufficient taxable income in recent years and whether sufficient taxable income is expected in future years in order to use the deferred tax asset. In evaluating the realizability of deferred income tax assets, we consider, among other things, historical levels of taxable income along with possible sources of future taxable income, which include: the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary reporting differences, the existence of taxable income in prior carryback year(s), the expected impact of tax planning strategies that may be implemented to prevent the potential loss of future income tax benefits, expected future taxable income and earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the future deductible amount, coupled with evidence indicating the loss is not a continuing condition. Changes in, among other things, income tax legislation, statutory income tax rates, or future taxable income levels could materially impact our valuation of income tax assets and liabilities and could cause our income tax provision to vary significantly among financial reporting periods. If, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized, we record a valuation allowance, or release all or a portion of the valuation allowance if it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets are expected to be realized. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe discussion below contains forward-looking statements,\u201d as defined in Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that reflect our current expectations regarding our future growth, results of operations, cash flows, performance and business prospects and opportunities, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management.

These statements are based on information currently available to us and are subject to various risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including, but not limited to, those matters discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors,\u201d in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K that could cause our actual growth, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, performance, business prospects and opportunities to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these statements. Except as expressly required by the federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to update such factors or to publicly announce the results of any of the forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future events, developments, or changed circumstances or for any other reason.\nAs used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms we,\u201d us,\u201d our,\u201d the Company,\u201d Perdoceo\u201d and PEC\u201d refer to Perdoceo Education Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. The terms institution\u201d and university\u201d refer to an individual, branded, for-profit educational institution, owned by us and including its campus locations. The term campus\u201d refers to an individual main or branch campus operated by one of our institutions.\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The MD&A is intended to help investors understand the results of operations, financial condition and present business environment. The MD&A is organized as follows:\n \u2022 Overview \n \u2022 Consolidated Results of Operations \n \u2022 Segment Results of Operations \n \u2022 Summary of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n \u2022 Liquidity, Financial Position and Capital Resources \nOVERVIEW\nOur academic institutions offer a quality postsecondary education primarily online to a diverse student population, along with campus-based and blended learning programs. Our accredited institutions - Colorado Technical University ( CTU\u201d) and the American InterContinental University System ( AIU\u201d) - provide degree programs through the master's or doctoral level as well as associate and bachelor's levels. Our universities offer students industry-relevant and career-focused academic programs that are designed to meet the educational needs of today's busy adults. CTU and AIU continue to show innovation in higher education, advancing personalized learning technologies like their intellipath\u00ae learning platform and using data analytics and technology to support students and enhance learning. Perdoceo is committed to providing quality education that closes the gap between learners who seek to advance their careers and employers needing a qualified workforce.\nOur reporting segments are determined in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 280 - Segment Reporting and are based upon how the Company analyzes performance and makes decisions. Each segment represents a postsecondary education provider that offers a variety of academic programs. We organize our business across two reporting segments: CTU and AIU (collectively referred to as the University Group\u201d).\nOn March 2, 2020, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Trident University International ( Trident University\u201d), an accredited university offering online undergraduate, master's and doctoral programs with a strong focus on graduate programs. Trident University's operations were brought within the scope of the state licensure, accreditation and Department of Education approval of American InterContinental University, with Trident University relinquishing its accreditor and Department approvals. Trident University's programs are now offered by AIU under the Trident\u201d name. The combined institution continues to serve existing and future students with a broader range of program offerings and resources.\nSee Note 18 Segment Reporting\u201d for a description of each of our current reporting segments along with revenues, operating income and total assets by reporting segment for each of the past three fiscal years.\nRegulatory Environment and Political Uncertainty\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry, which has significant impacts on our business and creates risks and uncertainties. In recent years, Congress, the Department, states, accrediting agencies, the CFPB, the FTC, state attorneys general and the media have scrutinized the for-profit postsecondary education sector. Congressional hearings and roundtable discussions were held regarding various aspects of the education industry and reports were issued that are highly critical of for-profit colleges and universities. A group of influential U.S. senators, consumer advocacy groups and some media outlets have strongly and repeatedly encouraged the Departments of Education, Defense and Veterans Affairs to take action to limit or terminate the participation of for-profit educational institutions, including Perdoceo, in existing tuition assistance programs.\nThe results of the 2020 Presidential and Congressional elections are likely to significantly impact future legislative and regulatory actions affecting our business. A loss or material reduction in Title IV Programs or the amount of student financial aid for which our students are eligible would materially impact our student enrollments and profitability and could impact the continued viability of our business as currently conducted.\nWe encourage you to review Item 1, Business,\u201d and Item 1A, Risk Factors,\u201d to learn more about our highly regulated industry and related risks and uncertainties.\nNote Regarding Non-GAAP measures\nWe believe it is useful to present non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain significant and non-cash items as a means to understand the performance of our core business. As a general matter, we use non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP to help analyze the performance of our core business, assist with preparing the annual operating plan, and measure performance for some forms of compensation. In addition, we believe that non-GAAP financial information is used by analysts and others in the investment community to analyze our historical results and to provide estimates of future performance.\nWe believe certain non-GAAP measures allow us to compare our current operating results with respective historical periods and with the operational performance of other companies in our industry because it does not give effect to potential differences caused by items we do not consider reflective of underlying operating performance, such as restructuring charges and significant legal reserves. In evaluating the use of non-GAAP measures, investors should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments presented below. Our presentation of non-GAAP measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by expenses that are unusual, non-routine or non-recurring. A non-GAAP measure has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for net income, operating income, earnings per diluted share, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with and reported under GAAP or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or as a measure of our liquidity.\nNon-GAAP financial measures, when viewed in a reconciliation to respective GAAP financial measures, provide an additional way of viewing the Company's results of operations and the factors and trends affecting the Company's business. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the respective financial results presented in accordance with GAAP.\n2020 Review\nOur financial results for the year ended December 31, 2020 ( current year\u201d) reflected improvements in revenue, operating income and cash flow from operations as well as both new and total student enrollment growth as compared to the prior year. In addition to underlying organic growth, the financial results for the current year were benefitted by the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Trident University (the Trident acquisition\u201d) in the current year. During the current year we continued to make targeted investments within our student support processes as well as within technological initiatives while executing against our objective of sustainable and responsible growth. We believe these investments positively impacted student experiences, retention and academic outcomes.\nWe completed the Trident acquisition during the first quarter of 2020 and we have continued our efforts to integrate Trident's academic programs along with its students, faculty and staff into AIU's operations. Trident's academic model and its master's and doctoral programs continue within AIU providing a diversification of educational learning models and programs to better serve students' needs. Trident students and faculty will also benefit over time from American InterContinental University's technology investments and operations support.\nTotal student enrollments increased 16.7% as of December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019, supported by an increase in new student enrollments of 20.2% for the current year as compared to the prior year. Total student enrollments for CTU increased by 4.2% as of December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 and new student enrollments increased 7.4% for the current year as compared to the prior year. Total student enrollments for AIU increased by 39.2% as of December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 and new student enrollments increased 37.3% for the current year as compared to the prior year. AIU's enrollment results reflect the Trident acquisition as well as organic student enrollment growth. AIU's enrollment days were\nrelatively comparable for the current year as compared to the prior year for American InterContinental University. Enrollment days attributable to any given quarter are the available days in the quarter during which a prospective student may apply to start school during that quarter.\nThe enrollment growth within both CTU and AIU reflects consistent levels of prospective student interest that were well served by our student enrollment processes. During the year we have also made investments to support remote work arrangements and upgrade our data center to enhance the security, stability and capacity of our IT infrastructure as well as further leveraged and applied our AI technology across a student's academic life cycle which enables us to efficiently serve prospective students and customize our outreach and engagement with current students to help them stay and succeed in school. We have also improved the efficiency and effectiveness of our student recruiting process to identify and attract prospective students that we believe are more likely to succeed in one of our academic programs. We believe our continued focus on student experiences, retention and academic outcomes, including the technology investments we have made, have contributed to positive new and total student enrollment growth.\nFinancial Highlights\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $59.6 million or 9.5% as compared to the prior year, reflecting revenue growth at both CTU and AIU as a result of the positive enrollment results discussed above and, for AIU, the Trident acquisition. Operating income for the current year increased to $142.9 million as compared to operating income of $86.5 million for the prior year. This improvement was primarily driven by reduced legal settlements within the current year as compared to the prior year. The prior year results included $37.1 million of expense related to the FTC and Oregon arbitration matters as compared to no significant legal settlements during the current year. Excluding the impact of the legal settlements, the operating income improvement reflects the revenue growth at CTU and AIU and reduced operating losses within Corporate and Other as well as pandemic-related savings, partially offset with ongoing investments in marketing, academics and other student-serving functions, as well as increased bad debt expense. Lastly, we reported cash provided by operations for the current year of $180.0 million as compared to cash provided by operations of $73.1 million in the prior year. The current year cash provided by operations was driven by the positive operating results at both CTU and AIU and timing of Title IV Program funds received in January 2020, partially offset with a settlement payment related to the Oregon arbitration matter.\nRevenue within our CTU segment increased $13.2 million or 3.4% for 2020 as compared to the prior year reflecting the increase in new and total student enrollments. Operating income for CTU increased by $29.9 million to $138.5 million for the current year as compared to operating income of $108.6 million in the prior year driven by decreased legal settlement expense as well as the increase in revenue for the current year, partially offset with increased expenses relating to marketing and student-serving functions.\nRevenue within our AIU segment increased $46.0 million or 19.5% for 2020 as compared to the prior year driven by the Trident acquisition. Operating income for AIU increased by $14.4 million to $30.8 million for the current year as compared to the prior year driven by the decrease in legal settlement expense as well as the increase in revenue, partially offset with increased expenses related to marketing and student-serving functions, as well as an increase in bad debt expense.\nWithin our Corporate and Other category, operating loss of $26.4 million improved by $12.2 million compared to an operating loss of $38.6 million in the prior year driven by reduced legal settlement expense and a reduction in operating losses associated with our closed campuses. The prior year included $7.1 million of legal settlement expense related to the Oregon arbitration matter as compared to no legal settlement expense in the current year.\nThe Company believes it is useful to present non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude certain significant and non-cash items, as a means to understand the performance of its operations. (See tables below for a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation.) Adjusted operating income for the total company was $159.0 million for the current year as compared to $134.3 million in the prior year with the improvement primarily driven by revenue gowth at both universities, efficiencies within operating processes and pandemic related cost savings partially offset with increased expenses related to student-serving functions and marketing and increased bad debt expense.\nAdjusted operating income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is presented below (dollars in thousands, unless otherwise noted):\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted Operating Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2020 (7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 142,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 86,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset impairment (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lease expenses for vacated space (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Significant legal settlements (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted Operating Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 158,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 134,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2020 (7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reported Earnings Per Diluted Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.74\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.97\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pre-tax adjustments included in operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization for acquired intangible assets (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset impairment (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.01\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lease expenses for vacated space (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.01\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Significant legal settlements (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total pre-tax adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.06\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tax effect of adjustments (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.02\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.13\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Release of valuation allowance (6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.22\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total adjustments after tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.18\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________________________\n (1) Asset impairment relates to a right of use asset for a vacated facility for a closed campus for which the sublease income was deemed no longer recoverable. \n (2) Lease expenses for vacated space include both fixed and variable lease costs offset with sublease income for closed campuses. \n (3) Significant legal settlements relate to the FTC and Oregon arbitration matters recorded during 2019. \n (4) Amortization for acquired intangible assets relates to definite-lived intangible assets associated with the Trident acquisition. \n (5) The tax effect of adjustments was calculated by multiplying the pre-tax adjustments with a tax rate of 25%. This tax rate is intended to reflect federal and state taxable jurisdictions as well as the nature of the adjustments. There is no tax effect applied to the adjustment related to the release of the valuation allowance as this is an adjustment for income tax. \n (6) This relates to the release of a valuation allowance in the amount of $16.0 million as a result of the current determination that it is more likely than not that the Company will utilize its deferred tax assets associated with the portion of the foreign tax credit carryforward supported by an overall domestic loss account balance. \n (7) 2020 results include the Trident acquisition commencing on the March 2, 2020 date of acquisition. \nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus outbreak ( COVID-19\u201d) a global pandemic. This contagious outbreak, which has continued to spread, and the related adverse public health developments, including travel restrictions and mandated non-essential business closures, have adversely affected workforces, organizations, customers, economies and financial markets globally, leading to an economic downturn and increased market volatility.\nSince the outbreak, we have made several changes to our business operations in response to the global pandemic. While our universities are primarily online, we have a small portion of our students at campus locations. We transitioned these campus-based students to our online environment with minimal disruptions. Students continue to take classes virtually utilizing our online platform and are proceeding with their academic studies with no major disruption to the level of service they are used to experiencing from our institutions and support staff. We have opened our ground-based campuses for limited campus activities and classes and arranged an appointment process for students to request additional help, if needed, at these campuses.\nAdditionally, we quickly and efficiently transitioned our workforce to a remote work environment. We continue to provide our employees with support and resources during this critical time so that they have the tools and information they need to continue supporting our students. Our benefit programs provide support for employees during the COVID-19 pandemic and leaves are also\navailable to eligible employees through the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), other applicable state leave laws and/or the Company's short-term disability, long-term disability or personal leave benefits.\nBoth our students and our workforce are well supported by our scalable and innovative technology infrastructure which enabled us to make these changes with minimal disruptions to our business operations.\nWe have not experienced any material disruptions to date and our strong balance sheet continues to provide us with the financial stability and flexibility to operate during these unprecedented times. Additionally, we are evaluating options to condense real estate facilities as a result of remote work arrangements along with geographically expanding our recruiting efforts. We continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our university operations for future impacts of a potential worsening of global economic conditions as well as other unanticipated consequences.\nTitle IV Programs\nA significant majority of our students rely on Title IV Programs to finance their education and therefore a significant proportion of our cash receipts come from Title IV Programs. As discussed throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our participation in Title IV Programs subjects us to extensive regulation. Significant resources and management time are devoted to monitoring compliance with this complex regulatory framework. The scrutiny of the for-profit postsecondary education sector and the results of the 2020 Presidential and Congressional elections, including the resulting changes in Department administration and policy objectives, could lead to significant regulatory changes. Regulatory change is also likely to continue to be considered by the states and other governmental and regulatory agencies.\nWe regularly evaluate opportunities to grow and benefit our business, including diversifying our educational offerings to increase the portion of our students who do not rely on Title IV Programs, which reduces the potential impact of future regulatory changes on our business. We will continue to evaluate these opportunities, including acquisition of quality educational institutions and programs and internally developing new programs where the students are less dependent upon Title IV Programs to finance their education, committing additional resources to grow our corporate partnership program and enhancing our efforts to recruit international students for our ground-based campuses following the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe will continue to closely monitor potential regulatory changes while we endeavor to manage our business in a way that enhances our ability to comply with any future regulatory changes. However, depending on the nature of any future regulatory changes, we may be required to alter the manner in which we conduct our business in order to preserve our students' ability to benefit from financial assistance for their education pursuant to Title IV Programs. Any necessary business changes could impact our future operating results and opportunities for growth. Please see Item 1A, Risk Factors - Risks Related to the Highly Regulated Field in Which we Operate,\u201d for more information about the risks and uncertainties relating to our highly regulated industry and potential regulatory changes.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe summary of selected financial data table below should be referenced in connection with a review of the following discussion of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands), including comparisons of our year-over-year performance between these years.

Occupancy expenses for the current year improved by 9.8% or $2.3 million as compared to the prior year, primarily driven by decreases associated with our closed campuses as those leased facilities reach the end of their lease terms.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense (dollars in thousands)\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2020 vs 2019 % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 vs 2018 % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Advertising and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 143,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 130,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 126,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Admissions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 99,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 92,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 92,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 127,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 162,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 139,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -21.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bad Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total general and administrative expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 417,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 430,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 390,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -3.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe general and administrative expense for the current year decreased by 3.0% or $12.9 million as compared to the prior year. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in administrative expense, which more than offset increases in advertising and marketing, admissions and bad debt expenses. The administrative expense decreased by 21.8% or $35.5 million primarily due to decreased legal settlement expense as 2019 contained approximately $37.1 million related to the FTC and Oregon arbitration matters whereas there were no significant legal settlements in the current year.\nThe advertising and marketing expense for the current year increased by 9.4% or $12.4 million as compared to the prior year, due to the Trident acquisition and investments made to serve prospective student interest. This increase is aligned with our prospective student interest and supports the positive total student enrollment growth within both CTU and AIU. Admissions expense increased by 6.6% or $6.2 million as compared to the prior year, due to the Trident acquisition as well as increased staffing to support the prospective student interest we are experiencing.\nBad debt expense incurred by each of our segments during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Segment Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Segment Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Segment Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2020 vs 2019 % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 vs 2018 % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bad debt expense by segment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CTU\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,783\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AIU\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,405\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total University Group\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate and Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (76\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total bad debt expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 47,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 43,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBad debt expense increased by 9.4% or $4.1 million for the current year as compared to the prior year, relatively in line with the increase in revenue. CTU's and AIU's bad debt increased by 0.9% or $0.2 million and 19.3% or $3.9 million, respectively, as compared to the prior year. As a percentage of revenue, bad debt for both CTU and AIU was relatively in line with the increase in revenue for the current year. Our student support teams have maintained their focus on financial aid documentation collection and are counseling students through the Title IV process so that they are better prepared to start school. We have also focused on emphasizing employer-paid and other direct-pay education programs such as corporate partnerships as students within these programs typically have lower bad debt expense associated with them.\nOperating Income\nOperating income for the current year increased by 65.3% or $56.5 million as compared to the prior year. The current year improvement was primarily driven by reduced legal settlements as compared to the prior year. The prior year operating results included $37.1 million of legal settlements related to the Oregon arbitration and FTC matters as compared to no significant legal settlements recorded during the current year. Additionally, the operating income for the current year benefitted from an increase in revenue of $59.6 million, reduced operating losses within Corporate and Other and pandemic-related cost savings. These benefits more than offset the increases in academics and student related, advertising and marketing, admissions and bad debt expenses.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a tax provision of $22.5 million which includes a $16.0 million favorable adjustment related to the release of a valuation allowance maintained against the portion of the foreign tax credit carryforward supported by an overall domestic loss account balance and a $0.4 million favorable adjustment associated with the tax effect of stock-based compensation.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a tax provision of $22.4 million, which includes a $1.2 million favorable adjustment associated with the tax effect of stock-based compensation and a $0.5 million net benefit associated with the results of a Florida income tax audit. The 2019 effective tax rate also reflected the deductibility of $29.7 million of the FTC settlement, which is the amount paid for the purpose of restitution. See Note 13 Income Taxes\u201d for further information. For the full year 2021, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 25.5% and 26.5%.\nSEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe summary of segment financial information below should be referenced in connection with a review of the following discussion of our segment results from operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands), including comparisons of our year-over-year performance between these years.

include the Trident acquisition commencing on the March 2, 2020 date of acquisition and as of December 31, 2020. \n (2) This category includes amounts that were historically reported within Corporate and Other prior to the segment change as of January 1, 2019, which combined the former All Other campuses segment (which was comprised of campuses being taught out) with Corporate and Other. \n (3) An expense of $18.6 million and $11.4 million was recorded within CTU and AIU, respectively, related to the FTC settlement during 2019. An expense of $7.1 million was recorded within Corporate and Other for our closed campuses related to the Oregon arbitration matter during 2019. \nTotal student enrollments represent all students who are active as of the last day of the reporting period. Active students are defined as those students who are considered in good attendance by participating in class related activities. New student enrollments represent students who have started class at one of our academic institutions during the period, excluding students who were previously active at any point in time within the 365 days prior to the start of their course.\nBeginning in 2021, we are redesigning CTU's academic calendar to strategically place breaks between sessions and provide more opportunities for students to continue with their academic programs. We believe this redesign will improve student experiences and engagement. CTU's academic calendar redesign, along with the previous academic calendar redesign at AIU, may impact the comparability of revenue-earning days and enrollment days as well as future new enrollment results to historical periods and may not be reflective of operating performance and enrollment growth. As a result, we will no longer report new student enrollment results and will focus our discussions on total student enrollment in future quarters.\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2020 vs 2019 % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 vs 2018 % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TOTAL STUDENT ENROLLMENTS:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CTU\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AIU (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total University Group\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2020 vs 2019 % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 vs 2018 % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NEW STUDENT ENROLLMENTS:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CTU\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AIU (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total University Group\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________\n(1) AIU includes new and total student enrollments relating to the Trident acquisition commencing on the March 2, 2020 date of acquisition and as of December 31, 2020.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nCTU. Current year revenue increased by 3.4% or $13.2 million as a result of the total student enrollment growth during 2020. For the year, CTU experienced positive new student enrollment growth of 7.4% supporting a total student enrollment increase of 4.2% as compared to the prior year. We believe this growth was supported by consistent levels of prospective student interest which were well served by CTU's student enrollment processes and technology enhancements.\nCurrent year operating income for CTU increased by 27.5% or $29.9 million as compared to the prior year, primarily due to the increase in revenue discussed above. The current year improvement also benefitted from lower legal settlement expense as compared to the prior year, which included $18.6 million of expense related to the FTC settlement. The increased advertising and marketing, academics and admissions expenses for the current year as compared to the prior year were partially offset with improved operating efficiencies.\nAIU. Current year revenue increased by 19.5% or $46.0 million driven by the Trident acquisition as well as new and total student enrollment growth during 2020. For the year, AIU experienced new student enrollment growth of 37.3% and increased total student enrollments by 39.2% as compared to the prior year. These enrollment results reflect the Trident acquisition as well as organic student enrollment growth driven by consistent levels of prospective student interest that were well served by AIU's student support functions. Enrollment days were relatively comparable for the current year as compared to the prior year for American InterContinental University. Enrollment days attributable to any given quarter are the available days in the quarter during which a prospective student may apply to start school during that quarter.\nCurrent year operating income for AIU increased by 87.8% or $14.4 million as compared to the prior year, driven by the increase in revenue as discussed above, and decreased administrative expense primarily related to lower legal settlement expense in the current year as compared to the prior year, which more than offset the increase in academics, advertising and marketing, admissions and bad debt expenses.\nCorporate and Other. This category includes unallocated costs that are incurred on behalf of the entire company and remaining expenses associated with closed campuses. Total Corporate and Other operating loss for the current year improved by 31.6% or $12.2 million as compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of decreased expenses associated with our closed campuses. Additionally, the prior year included $7.1 million of legal settlement expense related to the Oregon arbitration matter.\nSUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nWe have identified the accounting policies and estimates listed below as those that we believe require management's most subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties. This section should be read in conjunction with Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements which includes a discussion of these and other significant accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue, which is derived primarily from academic programs taught to students who attend our institutions, is generally segregated into two categories: (1) tuition and fees, and (2) other. Tuition and fees represent costs to our students for educational services provided by our institutions. Our institutions charge tuition and fees at varying amounts, depending on the institution, the type of program and specific curriculum. Our institutions bill students a single charge that covers tuition, fees and required program materials, such as textbooks and supplies, which we treat as a single performance obligation. Generally, we bill student tuition at the beginning of each academic term, and recognize the tuition as revenue on a straight-line basis over the academic term, which includes any applicable externship period. As part of a student's course of instruction, certain fees, such as technology fees and graduation fees, are billed to students. These fees are earned over the applicable term and are not considered separate performance obligations.\nRevenue recognition includes assumptions and significant judgments including determination of the appropriate portfolios to assess for meeting the criteria to recognize revenue under ASC Topic 606 as well as the assessment of collectability. These assumptions and significant judgments are based upon our interpretation of accounting guidance and historical experience. Although management believes these assumptions and significant judgments to be reasonable, actual amounts may differ if historical experience is not reflective of future results.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe extend unsecured credit to a portion of the students who are enrolled at our institutions for tuition and certain other educational costs. Based upon past experience and judgment, we establish an allowance for credit losses with respect to student receivables which we estimate will ultimately not be collectible. As such, our results from operations only reflect the amount of revenue that is estimated to be reasonably collectible. Our standard student receivable allowance is based on an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses for student receivables. Our estimation methodology considers a number of quantitative and qualitative factors that, based on our collection experience, we believe have an impact on our repayment risk and ability to collect student receivables. These factors include, but are not limited to: internal repayment history, changes in the current economic, legislative or regulatory environments, internal cash collection forecasts and the ability to complete the federal financial aid process with the student. These factors are monitored and assessed on a regular basis. Overall, our allowance estimation process for student receivables is validated by trending analysis and comparing estimated and actual performance.\nWe monitor our collections and write-off experience to assess whether or not adjustments to our allowance percentage estimates are necessary. Changes in trends in any of the factors that we believe impact the collection of our student receivables, as noted above, or modifications to our collection practices or other related policies may impact our estimate of our allowance for credit losses and our results from operations.\nA one percentage point change in our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of gross earned student receivables from continuing operations as of December 31, 2020 would have resulted in a change in pretax income from continuing operations of $0.9 million during the year then ended.\nBecause a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from Title IV Programs, any legislative or regulatory action that significantly reduces the funding available under Title IV Programs, or the ability of our students or institutions to participate in Title IV Programs, would likely have a material impact on the realizability of our receivables.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over fair market value of identifiable net assets acquired through business purchases. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350 - Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, we review goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis by applying a fair-value-based test. In evaluating the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill, we must make assumptions regarding the fair value of our reporting units, as defined under FASB ASC Topic 350. Our reporting units that have goodwill balances remaining as of December 31, 2020 are CTU and AIU. Goodwill is evaluated by comparing the book value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, with its fair value, as determined by a combination of income and market approach valuation methodologies ( quantitative assessment\u201d). If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered to be impaired. The amount of impairment loss is equal to the excess of the book value of the goodwill over the fair\nvalue of goodwill. In certain cases, a qualitative assessment may be used to determine if it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value and if the quantitative assessment is needed.\nWhen performing a quantitative assessment for the annual review of goodwill balances for impairment, we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units based on projected future operating results and cash flows, market assumptions and/or comparative market multiple methods. Determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions based on an evaluation of a number of factors, such as marketplace participants, relative market share, new student interest, student retention, future expansion or contraction expectations, amount and timing of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Projected future operating results and cash flows used for valuation purposes do reflect improvements relative to recent historical periods with respect to, among other things, modest revenue growth and operating margins. Although we believe our projected future operating results and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values are based on reasonable assumptions, historically projected operating results and cash flows have not always been achieved. The failure of one of our reporting units to achieve projected operating results and cash flows in the near term or long term may reduce the estimated fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value and result in the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge. Significant management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. In addition to cash flow estimates, our valuations are sensitive to the rate used to discount cash flows and future growth assumptions. These assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors,\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe did not record any goodwill impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2020. The reporting units with remaining goodwill as of December 31, 2020 are CTU and AIU which together had $118.3 million of goodwill remaining. Based on the quantitative fair value analysis performed as of October 1, 2020, the fair values of our CTU and AIU reporting units exceeded their carrying values by $458.4 million and $116.7 million (fair value as a percentage of carrying value for these reporting units of 904% and 229%), respectively.\nIntangible assets include indefinite-lived and definite-lived assets and are recorded at fair market value upon acquisition. In the year of acquisition, intangible assets, including student relationships, course curriculum and trade names reflect significant judgments made to estimate the fair value and useful life, including future cash flows, forecasts of future revenues and contributory asset charges. Intangible assets are reviewed quarterly for impairment if a triggering event is identified, and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed on an annual basis for impairment.\nSee Note 10 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to the income tax laws of the U.S. and various state and local jurisdictions. These tax laws are complex and subject to interpretation. As a result, significant judgments and interpretations are required in determining our income tax provisions (benefits) and evaluating our uncertain tax positions.\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740 - Income Taxes. Topic 740 requires the recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities based upon the income tax consequences of temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax reporting by applying enacted statutory income tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. Topic 740 also requires that deferred income tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized.\nIn assessing the need for a valuation allowance and/or release of a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. Topic 740 provides that important factors in determining whether a deferred tax asset will be realized are whether there has been sufficient taxable income in recent years and whether sufficient taxable income is expected in future years in order to use the deferred tax asset. In evaluating the realizability of deferred income tax assets, we consider, among other things, historical levels of taxable income along with possible sources of future taxable income, which include: the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary reporting differences, the existence of taxable income in prior carryback year(s), the expected impact of tax planning strategies that may be implemented to prevent the potential loss of future income tax benefits, expected future taxable income and earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the future deductible amount, coupled with evidence indicating the loss is not a continuing condition. Changes in, among other things, income tax legislation, statutory income tax rates, or future taxable income levels could materially impact our valuation of income tax assets and liabilities and could cause our income tax provision to vary significantly among financial reporting periods. If, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized, we record a valuation allowance, or release all or a portion of the valuation allowance if it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets are expected to be realized. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to"}
