We do not undertake and specifically decline any obligation to update any such statements or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any such statements to reflect future events or developments.\nOverview\nOur business strategy is to acquire and develop behavioral healthcare facilities and improve our operating results within our facilities and our other behavioral healthcare operations. We strive to improve the operating results of our facilities by providing high-quality services, expanding referral networks and marketing initiatives while meeting the increased demand for behavioral healthcare services through expansion of our current locations as well as developing new services within existing locations. At December 31, 2018, we operated 583 behavioral healthcare facilities with approximately 18,100 beds in 40 states, the U.K. and Puerto Rico. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we added 651 beds, including 499 added to existing facilities and 152 added through the opening of two de novo facilities. For the year ending December 31, 2019, we expect to add approximately 700 total beds exclusive of acquisitions.\nWe are the leading publicly traded pure-play provider of behavioral healthcare services, with operations in the U.S. and the U.K. Management believes that we are positioned as a leading platform in a highly fragmented industry under the direction of an\nexperienced management team that has significant industry expertise. Management expects to take advantage of several strategies that are more accessible as a result of our increased size and geographic scale, including continuing a national marketing strategy to attract new patients and referral sources, increasing our volume of out-of-state referrals, providing a broader range of services to new and existing patients and clients and selectively pursuing opportunities to expand our facility and bed count in the U.S. and U.K. through acquisitions, joint ventures and bed additions in existing facilities.\nAcquisitions\n2019 Acquisitions\nOn February 15, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Whittier, an inpatient psychiatric facility with 71 beds located in Haverhill, Massachusetts, for cash consideration of approximately $17.9 million. Also on February 15, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Mission Treatment for cash consideration of approximately $22.5 million and a working capital settlement. Mission Treatment operates nine comprehensive treatment centers in California, Nevada, Arizona and Oklahoma.\n2017 Acquisition\nOn November 13, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Aspire, an education facility with 36 beds located in Scotland, for cash consideration of approximately $21.3 million.\n2016 U.S. Acquisitions\nOn June 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Pocono Mountain, an inpatient psychiatric facility with 108 beds located in Henryville, Pennsylvania, for cash consideration of approximately $25.4 million.\nOn May 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of TrustPoint, an inpatient psychiatric facility with 100 beds located in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, for cash consideration of approximately $62.7 million.\nOn April 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Serenity Knolls, an inpatient psychiatric facility with 30 beds located in Forest Knolls, California, for cash consideration of approximately $10.0 million.\nPriory\nOn February 16, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Priory for a total purchase price of approximately $2.2 billion, including cash consideration of approximately $1.9 billion and the issuance of 4,033,561 shares of our common stock to shareholders of Priory. Priory was the leading independent provider of behavioral healthcare services in the U.K. operating 324 facilities with approximately 7,100 beds at the acquisition date.\nThe Competition and Markets Authority (the CMA\u201d) in the U.K. reviewed our acquisition of Priory. On July 14, 2016, the CMA announced that our acquisition of Priory was referred for a phase 2 investigation unless we offered acceptable undertakings to address the CMA's competition concerns relating to the provision of behavioral healthcare services in certain markets. On July 28, 2016, the CMA announced that we had offered undertakings to address the CMA's concerns and that, in lieu of a phase 2 investigation, the CMA would consider our undertakings.\nOn October 18, 2016, we signed a definitive agreement with BC Partners for the sale of 21 existing U.K. behavioral health facilities and one de novo behavioral health facility with an aggregate of approximately 1,000 beds. On November 10, 2016, the CMA accepted our undertakings to sell the U.K. Disposal Group to BC Partners and confirmed that the divestiture satisfied the CMA's concerns about the impact of our acquisition of Priory on competition for the provision of behavioral healthcare services in certain markets in the U.K. As a result of the CMA's acceptance of our undertakings, our acquisition of Priory was not referred for a phase 2 investigation. On November 30, 2016, we completed the sale of the U.K. Disposal Group to BC Partners for \u00a3320 million cash.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table illustrates our consolidated results of

Management uses Segment EBITDA as an analytical indicator to measure the performance of our segments and to develop strategic objectives and operating plans for those segments. Segment EBITDA is commonly used as an analytical indicator within the health care industry, and also serves as a measure of leverage capacity and debt service ability. Segment EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of financial performance under GAAP, and the items excluded from Segment EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Because Segment EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, Segment EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table sets forth percent changes in same facility operating data for our U.K. Facilities for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 compared to the same periods in the previous years:\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.K. Same Facility Results (a,c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Patient days growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Admissions growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -0.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average length of stay change (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -5.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue per patient day growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EBITDA margin change (d,e)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -240bps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -80bps\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (a)\n</td> <td> Results for the periods presented include facilities we have operated more than one year and exclude the elderly care division and certain closed services.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (b)\n</td> <td> Average length of stay is defined as patient days divided by admissions.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (c)\n</td> <td> Revenue and revenue per patient day for the previous year is adjusted to reflect the foreign currency exchange rate for the comparable period of the current year in order to eliminate the effect of changes in the exchange rate.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (d)\n</td> <td> See definition of Segment EBITDA in U.S. Same Facility Results table above.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (e)\n</td> <td> U.K. EBITDA margin for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was affected by lower census and higher operating expenses including contract labor in particular.

Revenue increased $176.1 million, or 6.2%, to $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $2.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulting from same facility revenue growth of 5.2% and the increase in the exchange rate between USD and GBP of $36.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated $1.9 billion of revenue, or 63.2% of our total revenue, from our U.S. Facilities and $1.1 billion of revenue, or 36.8% of our total revenue, from our U.K. Facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated $1.8 billion of revenue, or 63.8% of our total revenue, from our U.S. Facilities and $1.0 billion of revenue, or 36.2% of our total revenue, from our U.K. Facilities.\nU.S. same facility revenue increased by $96.7 million, or 5.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, resulting from same facility growth in patient days of 2.7% and an increase in same facility revenue per day of 2.7%. U.S. same facility revenue was impacted by a fourth quarter 2018 accounts receivable adjustment of approximately $8.0 million primarily related to our CTCs and the state Medicaid programs in Wisconsin. U.K. same facility revenue increased by $45.2 million, or 4.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, resulting from same facility growth in patient days of 1.6% and an increase in same facility revenue per day of 3.1%. Consistent with the same facility patient day growth in 2017, the growth in same facility patient days for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from the addition of beds to our existing facilities and ongoing demand for our services.\nSalaries, wages and benefits. Salaries, wages and benefits ( SWB\u201d) expense was $1.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $123.2 million. SWB expense included $22.0 million and $23.5 million of equity-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Excluding equity-based compensation expense, SWB expense was $1.6 billion, or 54.4% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $1.5 billion, or 53.3% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2017. Same facility SWB expense was\n$1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, or 51.6% of revenue compared to $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 51.1% of revenue.\nProfessional fees.

The $31.2 million increase was primarily attributable to higher contract labor costs in our U.K. Facilities. Contract labor costs in our U.K. Facilities were higher primarily due to the ongoing nursing and clinical labor shortage and our dependence on higher cost agency labor. Same facility professional fees were $196.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, or 6.8% of revenue, compared to $169.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 6.2% of revenue.\nSupplies. Supplies expense was $119.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, or 4.0% of revenue, compared to $114.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 4.0% of revenue. Same facility supplies expense was $111.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, or 3.9% of revenue, compared to $107.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 3.9% of revenue.\nRents and leases. Rents and leases were $80.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, or 2.7% of revenue, compared to $76.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 2.7% of revenue.

The increase in depreciation and amortization was attributable to depreciation associated with capital expenditures and real estate acquisitions during 2017 and 2018.\nInterest expense. Interest expense was $185.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $176.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in interest expense was primarily a result of higher interest rates applicable to our variable-rate debt slightly offset by the lower interest rates as a result of the Repricing Facilities Amendments to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.\nDebt extinguishment costs. Debt extinguishment costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 represented $0.6 million of cash charges and $0.3 million of non-cash charges recorded in connection with the Repricing Facilities Amendments to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and $0.9 million of cash charges in connection with the redemption of the 9.0% and 9.5% Revenue Bonds. Debt extinguishment costs for the year ended December 30, 2017 represent $0.5 million of charges and $0.3 of non-cash charges recorded in connection with the Third Repricing Amendment to the Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility.\nLegal settlements expense. Legal settlement costs of $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 represent $19.0 million related to the government investigation of the Company's billing for lab services in West Virginia and $3.1 million related to the resolution of the shareholder class action lawsuit filed in 2011 in connection with our merger with PHC, Inc. d/b/a Pioneer Behavioral Health ( PHC\u201d).\nLoss on impairment. Loss on impairment of $337.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 represents a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $325.9 million and a non-cash long-lived asset impairment charge of $12.0 million related to our U.K. Facilities.\nTransaction-related expenses. Transaction-related expenses were $34.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Transaction-related expenses represent costs incurred in the respective periods primarily related to our acquisitions and related integrated efforts and, for 2018, to the CEO transition.\nIn December 2018, Mr. Joey A. Jacobs was removed from his positions as the CEO and Chairman of the Board of directors (the Board\u201d) of the Company. Also in December 2018, Ms. Debra K. Osteen was elected by the Board to serve as the Company's CEO. In connection with this CEO transition, the Company recorded a charge of $14.0 million, which was comprised of cash payments to\nMr. Jacobs of $8.1 million, the accelerated vesting of Mr. Jacobs' restricted stock awards of $5.0 million, a cash payment to Ms. Osteen of $0.4 million and other costs of $0.5 million. CEO transition costs of $14.0 million were recorded in transaction-related expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nTransaction-related expenses are as summarized below (in thousands):\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CEO transition costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Termination and closure costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Legal, accounting and other fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 34,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProvision for income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the provision for income taxes was $6.5 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of (3.9)%, compared to $37.2 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of 15.7%, for 2017. The change in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to the disparity in the accounting treatment and the tax treatment of the loss on impairment recorded in 2018.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRevenue before provision for doubtful accounts. Revenue before provision for doubtful accounts increased $24.4 million, or 0.9%, to $2.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $2.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase related primarily to revenue generated during the year ended December 31, 2017 from the facilities acquired in our 2016 Acquisitions, particularly the acquisition of Priory, offset by the reduction in revenue before provision for doubtful accounts related to the U.K. Divestiture of $154.7 million and the decline in the exchange rate between USD and GBP of $45.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated $1.8 billion of revenue, or 63.8% of our total revenue, from our U.S. Facilities and $1.0 billion of revenue, or 36.2% of our total revenue, from our U.K. Facilities. During year ended December 31, 2016, we generated $1.7 billion of revenue, or 60.5% of our total revenue, from our U.S. Facilities and $1.1 billion of revenue, or 39.5% of our total revenue, from our U.K. Facilities.\nU.S. same facility revenue increased by $109.1 million, or 6.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, resulting from same facility growth in patient days of 4.8% and an increase in same facility revenue per day of 1.7%. U.K. same facility revenue increased by $28.9 million, or 3.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, resulting from same facility growth in patient days of 2.1% and an increase in same facility revenue per day of 1.5%. Consistent with the same facility patient day growth in 2016, the growth in same facility patient days for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted from the addition of beds to our existing facilities and ongoing demand for our services.\nProvision for doubtful accounts. The provision for doubtful accounts was $40.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 1.4% of revenue before provision for doubtful accounts, compared to $41.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 1.5% of revenue before provision for doubtful accounts.\nSalaries, wages and benefits. Salaries, wages and benefits ( SWB\u201d) expense was $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $5.7 million. SWB expense included $23.5 million and $28.3 million of equity-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Excluding equity-based compensation expense, SWB expense was $1.5 billion, or 53.3% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $1.5 billion, or 53.8% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The slight decrease in SWB expense, excluding equity-based compensation expense, was primarily attributable to the reduction in expense related to the U.K. Divestiture and the decline in the exchange rate between USD and GBP offset by SWB expense incurred by the facilities acquired in our 2016 Acquisitions, particularly the acquisition of Priory. Same facility SWB expense was $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 50.9% of revenue compared to $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 51.0% of revenue.\nProfessional fees. Professional fees were $196.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 6.9% of revenue, compared to $185.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 6.6% of revenue. The $10.7 million increase was primarily attributable professional fees incurred by the facilities acquired in our 2016 Acquisitions, particularly the acquisition of Priory, and higher contract labor costs in our U.K. Facilities offset by the reduction in expense related to the U.K. Divestiture and the decline in the exchange rate between USD and GBP. Same facility professional fees were $160.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 6.2% of revenue, compared to $145.0 million, for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 5.9% of revenue.\nSupplies. Supplies expense was $114.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 4.0% of revenue, compared to $117.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 4.2% of revenue. The $3.0 million decrease was primarily attributable to the reduction in expense related to the U.K. Divestiture and the decline in the exchange rate between USD and GBP offset by supplies expense incurred by the facilities acquired in our 2016 Acquisitions, particularly the acquisition of Priory. Same facility supplies expense was $103.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 4.0% of revenue, compared to $100.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 4.1% of revenue.\nRents and leases. Rents and leases were $76.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 2.7% of revenue, compared to $73.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 2.6% of revenue. The $3.4 million increase was primarily attributable to rents and leases incurred by the facilities acquired in our 2016 Acquisitions, particularly the acquisition of Priory slightly offset by the reduction in expense related to the U.K. Divestiture and the decline in the exchange rate between USD and GBP. Same facility rents and leases were $58.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 2.2% of revenue, compared to $57.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 2.3% of revenue.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses consisted primarily of purchased services, utilities, insurance, travel and repairs and maintenance expenses. Other operating expenses were $331.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 11.7% of revenue, compared to $312.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 11.1% of revenue. The $19.2 million increase was primarily attributable to other operating expenses incurred by the facilities acquired in our 2016 Acquisitions, particularly the acquisition of Priory slightly offset by the reduction in expense related to the U.K. Divestiture and the decline in the exchange rate between USD and GBP. Same facility other operating expenses were $297.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 11.4% of revenue, compared to $273.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 11.1% of revenue.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense was $143.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 5.0% of revenue, compared to $135.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 4.8% of revenue. The increase in depreciation and amortization was attributable to depreciation associated with capital expenditures during 2016 and 2017 and real estate acquired as part of the 2016 Acquisitions, particularly the acquisition of Priory, offset by reduction in expense related to the U.K. Divestiture and the decline in the exchange rate between USD and GBP.\nInterest expense. Interest expense was $176.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $181.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in interest expense was primarily a result of the lower interest rates in connection with amendments to the Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility and the debt paydown on November 30, 2016 using proceeds from the U.K. Divestiture. Interest expense was also impacted by higher interest rates applicable to our variable-rate debt, borrowings under the Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility and the issuance of the 6.500% Senior Notes on February 16, 2016.\nDebt extinguishment costs. Debt extinguishment costs for the year ended December 30, 2017 represent $0.5 million of charges and $0.3 of non-cash charges recorded in connection with the Third Repricing Amendment to the Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility. Debt extinguishment costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 represent $1.1 million of cash charges and $3.2 million of non-cash charges recorded in connection with the Tranche B-2 Repricing Amendment and the Refinancing Amendment.\nLoss on divestiture. As part of our divestitures in the U.K. and U.S., we recorded $178.8 million of loss on divestiture for the year ended December 31, 2016, which included an allocation of goodwill to the disposal groups of approximately $106.9 million, loss on the sale of properties of approximately $45.0 million, transaction-related expenses of approximately $26.8 million and write-off of intangible assets of approximately $0.1 million.\nGain on foreign currency derivatives. We entered into foreign currency forward contracts during the year ended December 31, 2016 in connection with (i) acquisitions in the U.K. and (ii) certain transfers of cash between the U.S. and the U.K. under our cash management and foreign currency risk management programs. Exchange rate changes between the contract date and the settlement date resulted in a gain on foreign currency derivatives of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nTransaction-related expenses. Transaction-related expenses were $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $48.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Transaction-related expenses represent costs incurred in the respective periods, primarily related to the 2016 Acquisitions, the U.K. Divestiture and the related integration efforts, as summarized below (in thousands):\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Termination and closure costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Legal, accounting and other fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Advisory and financing commitment fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProvision for income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the provision for income taxes was $37.2 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of 15.7%, compared to $28.8 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of 87.3%, for 2016. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to the Company's estimate of the one-time tax benefit on revaluation of deferred tax items pursuant to the enactment of the Tax Act as well as changes in the foreign exchange rate between USD and GBP in 2017 and the disparity between the accounting treatment and the tax treatment of the U.K. Divestiture on November 30, 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash provided by continuing operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $416.6 million compared to $401.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in cash provided by continuing operating activities was primarily attributable to growth in same facility operations. Days sales outstanding at December 31, 2018 was 39 compared to 38 at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had working capital of $34.0 million and $94.2 million, respectively.\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $361.0 million compared to $336.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Our strategic plan does not require the repatriation of foreign cash in order to fund our operations in the U.S., and it is our current intention to permanently reinvest our foreign cash and cash equivalents outside of the U.S.\nAmended and Restated Senior Credit Facility\nWe entered into a Senior Secured Credit Facility on April 1, 2011. On December 31, 2012, we entered into the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement which amended and restated the Senior Secured Credit Facility. We have amended the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement from time to time as described in our prior filings with the SEC.\nOn January 25, 2016, we entered into the Ninth Amendment to our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Ninth Amendment modified certain definitions and provides increased flexibility to us in terms of our financial covenants. Our baskets for\npermitted investments were also increased to provide increased flexibility for us to invest in non-wholly owned subsidiaries, joint ventures and foreign subsidiaries. As a result of the Ninth Amendment, we may invest in non-wholly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures up to 10.0% of our and our subsidiaries' total assets in any consecutive four fiscal quarter period, and up to 12.5% of our and our subsidiaries' total assets during the term of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. We may also invest in foreign subsidiaries that are not loan parties up to 10% of our and our subsidiaries' total assets in any consecutive four fiscal quarter period, and up to 15% of our and our subsidiaries' total assets during the term of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The foregoing permitted investments are subject to an aggregate cap of 25% of our and our subsidiaries' total assets in any fiscal year.\nOn February 16, 2016, we entered into the Second Incremental Facility Amendment to our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Second Incremental Amendment activated a new $955.0 million incremental Term Loan B facility and added $135.0 million to the Term Loan A facility to our Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility, subject to limited conditionality provisions. Borrowings under the Tranche B-2 Facility were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Priory and the fees and expenses for such acquisition and the related financing transactions. Borrowings under the TLA Facility were used to pay down the majority of our $300.0 million revolving credit facility.\nOn May 26, 2016, we entered into a Tranche B-1 Repricing Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Tranche B-1 Repricing Amendment reduced the Applicable Rate with respect to the Tranche B-1 Facility from 3.5% to 3.0% in the case of Eurodollar Rate loans and 2.5% to 2.0% in the case of Base Rate Loans.\nOn September 21, 2016, we entered into a Tranche B-2 Repricing Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Tranche B-2 Repricing Amendment reduced the Applicable Rate with respect to the Tranche B-2 Facility from 3.75% to 3.00% in the case of Eurodollar Rate loans and 2.75% to 2.00% in the case of Base Rate Loans. In connection with the Tranche B-2 Repricing Amendment, we recorded a debt extinguishment charge of $3.4 million, including the discount and write-off of deferred financing costs, which was recorded in debt extinguishment costs in the consolidated statements of operations.\nOn November 22, 2016, we entered into a Tenth Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.

The Refinancing Amendment increased our line of credit on our revolving credit facility to $500.0 million from $300.0 million and reduced our TLA Facility to $400.0 million from $600.6 million. In addition, the Refinancing Amendment extended the maturity date for the Refinancing Facilities to November 30, 2021 from February 13, 2019, and lowered our effective interest rate on our line of credit on our revolving credit facility and TLA Facility by 50 basis points. In connection with the Refinancing Amendment, we recorded a debt extinguishment charge of $0.8 million, including the write-off of deferred financing costs, which was recorded in debt extinguishment costs in the consolidated statements of operations.\nOn May 10, 2017, we entered into the Third Repricing Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Third Repricing Amendment reduced the Applicable Rate with respect to the Tranche B-1 Facility and the Tranche B-2 Facility from 3.0% to 2.75% in the case of Eurodollar Rate loans and 2.0% to 1.75% in the case of Base Rate Loans.

The Third Repricing Facilities Amendment replaced the existing revolving credit facility and TLA Facility with a new revolving credit facility and TLA Facility, respectively. Our line of credit on the revolving credit facility remains at $500.0 million and the Third Repricing Facility Amendment reduced the size of the TLA Facility from $400.0 million to $380.0 million to reflect the then current outstanding principal. The Third Repricing Facilities Amendment reduced the Applicable Rate for the revolving credit facility and the TLA Facility by amending the definition of Applicable Rate\u201d and replacing the rate table therein with the table set forth below.\nIn connection with the Repricing Facilities Amendments, we recorded a debt extinguishment charge of $0.9 million, including the discount and write-off of deferred financing costs, which was recorded in debt extinguishment costs in the consolidated statements of operations.\nOn February 6, 2019, we entered into the Eleventh Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Eleventh Amendment, among other things, amended the definition of Consolidated EBITDA\u201d to remove the cap on non-cash charges, losses and expenses related to the impairment of goodwill, which in turn provided increased flexibility to us in terms of our financial covenants.\nOn February 27, 2019, we entered into the Twelfth Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Twelfth Amendment, among other things, modified certain definitions, including Consolidated EBITDA\u201d, and increased our permitted Maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio, thereby providing increased flexibility to us in terms of our financial covenants.\nWe had $486.7 million of availability under the revolving line of credit and had standby letters of credit outstanding of $13.3 million related to security for the payment of claims required by our workers' compensation insurance program at December 31, 2018. Borrowings under the revolving line of credit are subject to customary conditions precedent to borrowing. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement requires quarterly term loan principal repayments of our TLA Facility of $4.8 million for March 31, 2019 to December 31, 2019, $7.1 million for March 31, 2020 to December 31, 2020, and $9.5 million for March 31, 2021 to September 30, 2021, with the remaining principal balance of the TLA Facility due on the maturity date of November 30, 2021. We are required to repay the Tranche B-3 Facility in equal quarterly installments of $1.2 million on the last business day of each March, June, September and December, with the outstanding principal balance of the Tranche B-3 Facility due on February 11, 2022. We are required to repay the Tranche B-4 Facility in equal quarterly installments of approximately $2.3 million on the last business day of each March, June, September and December, with the outstanding principal balance of the Tranche B-4 Facility due on February 16, 2023. On December 29, 2017, the Company made an additional payment of $22.5 million, including $7.7 million on the Tranche B-1 Facility and $14.8 million on the Tranche B-2 Facility. On April 17, 2018, we made an additional payment of $15.0 million, including $5.1 million on the Tranche B-3 Facility and $9.9 million on the Tranche B-4 Facility.\nBorrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are guaranteed by each of our wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries (other than certain excluded subsidiaries) and are secured by a lien on substantially all of our and such subsidiaries' assets. Borrowings with respect to the TLA Facility and our revolving credit facility (collectively, Pro Rata Facilities\u201d) under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate tied to Acadia's Consolidated Leverage Ratio (defined as consolidated funded debt net of up to $50.0 million of unrestricted and unencumbered cash to consolidated EBITDA, in each case as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement). The Applicable Rate (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) for the Pro Rata Facilities was 2.5% for Eurodollar Rate Loans (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) and 1.5% for Base Rate Loans (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) at December 31, 2018. Eurodollar Rate Loans with respect to the Pro Rata Facilities bear interest at the Applicable Rate plus the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) (based upon the LIBOR Rate (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) prior to commencement of the interest rate period). Base Rate Loans with respect to the Pro Rata Facilities bear interest at the Applicable Rate plus the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the prime rate and (iii) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.0%. At December 31, 2018, the Pro Rata Facilities bore interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.5%. In addition, we are required to pay a commitment fee on undrawn amounts under our revolving credit facility.\nThe interest rates and the unused line fee on unused commitments related to the Pro Rata Facilities are based upon the following pricing tiers:\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td> Pricing Tier\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Consolidated\nLeverage Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Eurodollar\nRate Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Base Rate\nLoans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Commitment\nFee\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> < 3.50:1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.50\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.50\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.20\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >3.50:1.0 but < 4.00:1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.75\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.75\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.25\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >4.00:1.0 but < 4.50:1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.30\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >4.50:1.0 but < 5.25:1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.25\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.25\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.35\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >5.25:1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.50\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.50\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.40\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEurodollar Rate Loans with respect to the Tranche B-3 Facility bear interest at the Tranche B-3 Facility Applicable Rate (as defined below) plus the Eurodollar Rate (subject to a floor of 0.75% and based upon the LIBOR Rate prior to commencement of the interest rate period). Base Rate Loans bear interest at the Tranche B-3 Facility Applicable Rate plus the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the prime rate and (iii) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.0%. As used herein, the term Tranche B-3 Facility Applicable Rate\u201d means, with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans, 2.50%, and with respect to Base Rate Loans, 1.50%. The Tranche B-4 Facility\nbears interest as follows: Eurodollar Rate Loans bear interest at the Applicable Rate (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) plus the Eurodollar Rate (subject to a floor of 0.75% and based upon the LIBOR Rate prior to commencement of the interest rate period) and Base Rate Loans bear interest at the Applicable Rate plus the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the prime rate and (iii) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.0%. As used herein, the term Applicable Rate\u201d means, with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans, 2.50%, and with respect to Base Rate Loans, 1.50%.\nThe lenders who provided the Tranche B-3 Facility and Tranche B-4 Facility are not entitled to benefit from our maintenance of its financial covenants under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Accordingly, if we fail to maintain its financial covenants, such failure shall not constitute an event of default under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with respect to the Tranche B-3 Facility or Tranche B-4 Facility until and unless the Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility is accelerated or the commitment of the lenders to make further loans is terminated.\nThe Amended and Restated Credit Agreement requires us and our subsidiaries to comply with customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants, including a fixed charge coverage ratio, consolidated leverage ratio and consolidated senior secured leverage ratio. We may be required to pay all of our indebtedness immediately if we default on any of the numerous financial or other restrictive covenants contained in any of its material debt agreements. We may be required to pay all of our indebtedness immediately if we default on any of the numerous financial or other restrictive covenants contained in any of our material debt agreements.

The 6.125% Senior Notes mature on March 15, 2021 and bear interest at a rate of 6.125% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year.\n5.125% Senior Notes due 2022\nOn July 1, 2014, we issued $300.0 million of 5.125% Senior Notes due 2022. The 5.125% Senior Notes mature on July 1, 2022 and bear interest at a rate of 5.125% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year.\n5.625% Senior Notes due 2023\nOn February 11, 2015, we issued $375.0 million of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2023. On September 21, 2015, we issued $275.0 million of additional 5.625% Senior Notes. The additional notes formed a single class of debt securities with the 5.625% Senior Notes issued in February 2015. Giving effect to this issuance, we have outstanding an aggregate of $650.0 million of 5.625% Senior Notes. The 5.625% Senior Notes mature on February 15, 2023 and bear interest at a rate of 5.625% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year.\n6.500% Senior Notes due 2024\nOn February 16, 2016, we issued $390.0 million of 6.500% Senior Notes due 2024. The 6.500% Senior Notes mature on March 1, 2024 and bear interest at a rate of 6.500% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on September 1, 2016.\nThe indentures governing the Senior Notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit the Company's ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to: (i) pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions or investments; (ii) incur additional debt or issue certain preferred stock; (iii) transfer or sell assets; (iv) engage in certain transactions with affiliates; (v) create restrictions on dividends or other payments by the restricted subsidiaries; (vi) merge, consolidate or sell substantially all of the Company's assets; and (vii) create liens on assets.\nThe Senior Notes issued by the Company are guaranteed by each of the Company's subsidiaries that guarantee the Company's obligations under the Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility. The guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several.\nThe Company may redeem the Senior Notes at its option, in whole or part, at the dates and amounts set forth in the indentures.\n9.0% and 9.5% Revenue Bonds\nOn November 11, 2012, in connection with the acquisition of The Pavilion at HealthPark, LLC ( Park Royal\u201d), we assumed debt of $23.0 million. The fair market value of the debt assumed was $25.6 million and resulted in a debt premium balance being recorded as of the acquisition date. The debt consisted of $7.5 million and $15.5 million of 9.0% and 9.5% Revenue Bonds, respectively.\nOn December 1, 2018, we exercised the option to redeem in whole the 9.0% and 9.5% Revenue Bonds at a redemption price equal to the sum of 104% of the principal amount of the 9.0% and 9.5% Revenue Bonds plus accrued and unpaid interest. In connection with the redemption of the 9.0% and 9.5% Revenue Bonds, we recorded a debt extinguishment charge of $0.9 million, which was recorded in debt extinguishment costs in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe 9.0% bonds in the amount of $7.5 million had a maturity date of December 1, 2030 and required yearly principal payments beginning in 2013. The 9.5% bonds in the amount of $15.5 million had a maturity date of December 1, 2040 and required yearly principal payments beginning in 2031. The principal payments established a bond sinking fund to be held with the trustee and shall be sufficient to redeem the principal amounts of the 9.0% and 9.5% Revenue Bonds on their respective maturity dates. At December 31, 2017, $2.3 million was recorded within other assets on the consolidated balance sheets related to the debt service reserve fund requirements. The yearly principal payments, which established a bond sinking fund, will increase the debt service reserve fund requirements. The bond premium amount of $2.6 million was amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the life of the revenue bonds using the effective interest method.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents a summary of contractual obligations (dollars in thousands):\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less Than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More Than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 208,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 862,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,445,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 396,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,913,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 118,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 99,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 777,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,060,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase and other obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 68,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total obligations and commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 277,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,017,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,546,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,200,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,042,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Amounts include required principal and interest payments.

Our long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2018 was composed of $1.5 billion of fixed-rate debt and $1.7 billion of variable-rate debt with interest based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin. A hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates (which would equate to a 0.50% higher rate on our variable-rate debt) would decrease our net income and cash flows by $7.3 million on an annual basis based upon our borrowing level at December 31, 2018.\nLIBOR and certain other interest benchmarks\u201d may be subject to regulatory guidance and/or reform that could cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated consequences. The U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it intends to stop encouraging or requiring banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR rates after 2021, and it is unclear if LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will evolve. If LIBOR ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating LIBOR change from their current form, interest rates on our current or future debt obligations may be adversely affected.\nForeign Currency Risk\nThe functional currency for our U.K. facilities is the British pound or GBP. Our revenue and earnings are sensitive to changes in the GBP to USD exchange rate from the translation of our earnings into USD at exchange rates that may fluctuate. Based upon the level of our U.K. operations relative to the Company as a whole, a hypothetical 10% change (which would equate to an increase or decrease in the exchange rate of 0.13) would cause a change in our net income of approximately $8.6 million on an annual basis.\nIn May 2016, we entered into multiple cross currency swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $650.0 million to manage foreign currency exchange risk by effectively converting a portion of our fixed-rate USD denominated senior notes, including the semi-annual interest payments thereunder, to fixed-rate, GBP-denominated debt of \u00a3449.3 million. The cross currency swap agreements limit the impact of changes in the exchange rate on our cash flows and leverage.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. In preparing our financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses included in the financial statements. Estimates are based on historical experience and other available information, the results of which form the basis of such estimates. While management believes our estimation processes are reasonable, actual results could differ from our estimates. The following accounting policies are considered critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating performance and involve highly subjective and complex assumptions and assessments:\nRevenue and Accounts Receivable\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) and the International Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09. ASU 2014-09's core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We adopted ASU 2014-09 using the modified retrospective method effective January 1, 2018. As a result of certain changes required by ASU 2014-09, the majority of our provision for doubtful accounts are recorded as a direct reduction to revenue instead of being presented as a separate line item on the consolidated statements of operations. The adoption of ASU 2014-09 did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nOur revenue is primarily derived from services rendered to patients for inpatient psychiatric and substance abuse care, outpatient psychiatric care and adolescent residential treatment. We receive payments from the following sources for services rendered in our facilities: (i) state governments under their respective Medicaid and other programs; (ii) commercial insurers; (iii) the federal government under the Medicare program administered by CMS; (iv) publicly funded sources in the U.K. (including the NHS, CCGs and local authorities in England, Scotland and Wales) and (v) individual patients and clients. We determine the transaction price based on established billing rates reduced by contractual adjustments provided to third-party payors, discounts provided to uninsured patients and implicit price concessions. Contractual adjustments and discounts are based on contractual agreements, discount policies and historical experience. Implicit price concessions are based on historical collection experience.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from Medicare, Medicaid and other payors that receive discounts from established billing rates. The Medicare and Medicaid regulations and various managed care contracts under which these discounts must be calculated are complex, subject to interpretation and adjustment, and may include multiple reimbursement mechanisms for different types of services provided in the Company's inpatient facilities and cost settlement provisions. Management estimates the transaction price on a payor-specific basis given its interpretation of the applicable regulations or contract terms. The services authorized and provided and related reimbursement are often subject to interpretation that could result in payments that differ from our estimates. Additionally, updated regulations and contract renegotiations occur frequently, necessitating regular review and assessment of the estimation process by management.\nSettlements under cost reimbursement agreements with third-party payors are estimated and recorded in the period in which the related services are rendered and are adjusted in future periods as final settlements are determined. Final determination of amounts earned under the Medicare and Medicaid programs often occurs in subsequent years because of audits by such programs, rights of appeal and the application of numerous technical provisions. In the opinion of management, adequate provision has been made for any adjustments and final settlements. However, there can be no assurance that any such adjustments and final settlements will not have a material effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations. Our cost report receivables were $10.3 million and $9.0 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and were included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Management believes that these receivables are properly stated and are not likely to be settled for a significantly different amount. The net adjustments to estimated cost report settlements resulted in increases to revenue of $0.5 million, $0.2 million and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe following table presents revenue by payor type and as a percentage of revenue in our U.S. Facilities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 121:

2018 and 2017 included approximately $1.5 million and $0.9 million, respectively, of accounts pending Medicaid approval.\nInsurance\nWe are subject to medical malpractice and other lawsuits due to the nature of the services we provide. A portion of our professional liability risks are insured through a wholly-owned insurance subsidiary. We are self-insured for professional liability claims up to $3.0 million per claim and have obtained reinsurance coverage from a third party to cover claims in excess of the retention limit. The reinsurance policy has a coverage limit of $75.0 million in the aggregate. Our reinsurance receivables are recognized consistent with the related liabilities and include known claims and any incurred but not reported claims that are covered by current insurance policies in place. The reserve for professional and general liability risks was estimated based on historical claims, demographic factors, industry trends, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accrual for professional and general liabilities could be significantly affected should current and future occurrences differ from historical claim trends and expectations. While claims are monitored closely when estimating professional and general liability accruals, the complexity of the claims and wide range of potential outcomes often hampers timely adjustments to the assumptions used in these estimates. The professional and general liability reserve was $42.8 million at December 31, 2018, of which $5.0 million was included in other accrued liabilities and $37.8 million was included in other long-term liabilities. The professional and general liability reserve was $55.0 million at December 31, 2017, of which $22.8 million was included in other accrued liabilities and $32.2 million was included in other long-term liabilities. We estimate receivables for the portion of professional and general liability reserves that are recoverable under our insurance policies. Such receivable was $8.2 million at December 31, 2018, of which $2.1 million was included in other current assets and $6.1 million was included in other assets, and such receivable was $22.7 million at December 31, 2017, of which $17.6 million was included in other current assets and $5.1 million was included in other assets.\nOur statutory workers' compensation program is fully insured with a $0.5 million deductible per accident. The workers' compensation liability was $19.3 million at December 31, 2018, of which $10.0 million was included in accrued salaries and benefits and $9.3 million was included in other long-term liabilities, and such liability was $18.5 million at December 31, 2017, of which $10.0 million was included in accrued salaries and benefits and $8.5 million was included in other long-term liabilities. The reserve for workers compensation claims was based upon independent actuarial estimates of future amounts that will be paid to claimants. Management believes that adequate provisions have been made for workers' compensation and professional and general liability risk exposures.\nProperty and Equipment and Other Long-Lived Assets\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which typically range from 10 to 50 years for buildings and improvements, three to seven years for equipment and the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful lives for leasehold improvements. When assets are sold or retired, the corresponding cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the related accounts and any gain or loss is recorded in the period of sale or retirement. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation expense was $158.8 million, $143.0 million and $134.8 million for the years ended years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe carrying values of long-lived assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events, circumstances or operating results indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If this review indicates that the asset will not be recoverable, as determined based upon the undiscounted cash flows of the operating asset over the remaining useful lives, the carrying value of the asset will be reduced to its estimated fair value. Fair value estimates are based on independent appraisals, market values of comparable assets or internal evaluations of future net cash flows.\nWe performed our impairment review of long-lived assets in the fourth quarter of 2018, which indicated the carrying amounts of certain long-lived assets in our U.K. Facilities may not be recoverable. This created a non-cash loss on impairment of $12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was recorded in loss on impairment on our consolidated statements of operations. No impairment was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment\u201d ( ASU 2017-04\u201d). ASU 2017-04 simplifies the measurement of goodwill by eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill (step 2 of the current impairment test) to measure the goodwill impairment charge. Instead, entities record impairment charges based on the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value. ASU 2017-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We elected to early adopt ASU 2017-04 on January 1, 2018.\nOur goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of license and accreditations, trade names and certificates of need intangible assets that are not amortized, are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more\nfrequently if events indicate the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable. We have two operating segments, U.S. Facilities and U.K. Facilities, for segment reporting purposes, each of which represents a reporting unit for purposes of the Company's goodwill impairment test.\nOur annual goodwill impairment test performed as of October 1, 2018 considered the recent financial performance, including the labor market pressures faced by our U.K. Facilities. The impairment test for the U.S. Facilities indicated estimated fair value exceeded carrying value, and therefore no impairment was recorded. The impairment test for the U.K. Facilities indicated carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value. The difference was recorded as a non-cash loss on impairment of $325.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 within loss on impairment in the consolidated statements of operations. Our annual impairment tests of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2017 and 2016 resulted in no impairment charges.\nIn performing the goodwill impairment test, we used a combination of the income and market approaches to estimate fair value of our reporting units. Determining fair value requires substantial judgement and use significant unobservable inputs, which are categorized as Level 3 fair value measurements. For the income approach, we used a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows are projected using internal forecasts over future periods, plus a terminal value, and are discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted rate of return. Our internal forecasts include estimates of growth rates based on our current views of the long-term outlook of each reporting unit and may materially differ from actual results. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of each reporting unit. The discount rates used in our analysis range from 9.0% to 10.5% and correspond to the risks inherent in each reporting unit. For the market approach, we compared our reporting units to guideline companies actively traded in public markets and included a control premium, which was based on acquisition premiums of selected companies similar to our reporting units. Estimating fair values of our reporting units includes substantial judgement and significant estimates and may materially differ from actual results. Changes in assumptions, industry or peer groups could negatively impact estimated fair value.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The amount of deferred taxes on these temporary differences is determined using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, as applicable, based on tax rates and laws in the respective tax jurisdiction enacted as of the balance sheet date.\nWe review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, applicable tax strategies, and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nWe report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\nWe also have accruals for taxes and associated interest that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities. We accrue for tax contingencies when it is more likely than not that a liability to a taxing authority has been incurred and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated. Although we believe that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable, we nevertheless have established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken by us resulting in additional liabilities for taxes and interest. These amounts are reviewed as circumstances warrant and adjusted as events occur that affect our potential liability for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, conclusion of tax audits, additional exposure based on current calculations, identification of new issues, release of administrative guidance, or rendering of a court decision affecting a particular tax issue.", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I am unable to complete your request because I am unable to identify the text you would like me to summarize.\n- Could you please provide the text so that I

We strive to improve the operating results of our facilities by providing high-quality services, expanding referral networks and marketing initiatives while meeting the increased demand for behavioral healthcare services through expansion of our current locations as well as developing new services within existing locations. At December 31, 2018, we operated 583 behavioral healthcare facilities with approximately 18,100 beds in 40 states, the U.K. and Puerto Rico. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we added 651 beds, including 499 added to existing facilities and 152 added through the opening of two de novo facilities. For the year ending December 31, 2019, we expect to add approximately 700 total beds exclusive of acquisitions.\nWe are the leading publicly traded pure-play provider of behavioral healthcare services, with operations in the U.S. and the U.K. Management believes that we are positioned as a leading platform in a highly fragmented industry under the direction of an\nexperienced management team that has significant industry expertise. Management expects to take advantage of several strategies that are more accessible as a result of our increased size and geographic scale, including continuing a national marketing strategy to attract new patients and referral sources, increasing our volume of out-of-state referrals, providing a broader range of services to new and existing patients and clients and selectively pursuing opportunities to expand our facility and bed count in the U.S. and U.K. through acquisitions, joint ventures and bed additions in existing facilities.\nAcquisitions\n2019 Acquisitions\nOn February 15, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Whittier, an inpatient psychiatric facility with 71 beds located in Haverhill, Massachusetts, for cash consideration of approximately $17.9 million. Also on February 15, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Mission Treatment for cash consideration of approximately $22.5 million and a working capital settlement. Mission Treatment operates nine comprehensive treatment centers in California, Nevada, Arizona and Oklahoma.\n2017 Acquisition\nOn November 13, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Aspire, an education facility with 36 beds located in Scotland, for cash consideration of approximately $21.3 million.\n2016 U.S. Acquisitions\nOn June 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Pocono Mountain, an inpatient psychiatric facility with 108 beds located in Henryville, Pennsylvania, for cash consideration of approximately $25.4 million.\nOn May 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of TrustPoint, an inpatient psychiatric facility with 100 beds located in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, for cash consideration of approximately $62.7 million.\nOn April 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Serenity Knolls, an inpatient psychiatric facility with 30 beds located in Forest Knolls, California, for cash consideration of approximately $10.0 million.\nPriory\nOn February 16, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Priory for a total purchase price of approximately $2.2 billion, including cash consideration of approximately $1.9 billion and the issuance of 4,033,561 shares of our common stock to shareholders of Priory. Priory was the leading independent provider of behavioral healthcare services in the U.K. operating 324 facilities with approximately 7,100 beds at the acquisition date.\nThe Competition and Markets Authority (the CMA\u201d) in the U.K. reviewed our acquisition of Priory. On July 14, 2016, the CMA announced that our acquisition of Priory was referred for a phase 2 investigation unless we offered acceptable undertakings to address the CMA's competition concerns relating to the provision of behavioral healthcare services in certain markets. On July 28, 2016, the CMA announced that we had offered undertakings to address the CMA's concerns and that, in lieu of a phase 2 investigation, the CMA would consider our undertakings.\nOn October 18, 2016, we signed a definitive agreement with BC Partners for the sale of 21 existing U.K. behavioral health facilities and one de novo behavioral health facility with an aggregate of approximately 1,000 beds. On November 10, 2016, the CMA accepted our undertakings to sell the U.K. Disposal Group to BC Partners and confirmed that the divestiture satisfied the CMA's concerns about the impact of our acquisition of Priory on competition for the provision of behavioral healthcare services in certain markets in the U.K. As a result of the CMA's acceptance of our undertakings, our acquisition of Priory was not referred for a phase 2 investigation. On November 30, 2016, we completed the sale of the U.K. Disposal Group to BC Partners for \u00a3320 million cash.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table illustrates our consolidated results of operations for the respective periods shown (dollars in thousands):\n\nSegments\nAt December 31, 2018, the U.S. Facilities segment included 213 behavioral healthcare facilities with approximately 9,300 beds in 40 states and Puerto Rico, and the U.K. Facilities segment included 370 behavioral healthcare facilities with approximately 8,800 beds in the U.K.\nThe following table sets forth percent changes in same facility operating data for our U.S. Facilities for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 compared to same periods in the previous years:\n\n (a) Results for the periods presented include facilities we have operated more than one year and exclude certain closed services. \n (b) Average length of stay is defined as patient days divided by admissions. \n (c) Segment EBITDA is defined as income before provision for income taxes, equity-based \n compensation expense, debt extinguishment costs, legal settlements expense, loss on impairment, loss on divestiture, gain on foreign currency derivatives, transaction-related expenses, interest expense and depreciation and amortization. Management uses Segment EBITDA as an analytical indicator to measure the performance of our segments and to develop strategic objectives and operating plans for those segments. Segment EBITDA is commonly used as an analytical indicator within the health care industry, and also serves as a measure of leverage capacity and debt service ability. Segment EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of financial performance under GAAP, and the items excluded from Segment EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Because Segment EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, Segment EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. \nThe following table sets forth percent changes in same facility operating data for our U.K. Facilities for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 compared to the same periods in the previous years:\n\n (a) Results for the periods presented include facilities we have operated more than one year and exclude the elderly care division and certain closed services. \n (b) Average length of stay is defined as patient days divided by admissions. \n (c) Revenue and revenue per patient day for the previous year is adjusted to reflect the foreign currency exchange rate for the comparable period of the current year in order to eliminate the effect of changes in the exchange rate. \n (d) See definition of Segment EBITDA in U.S. Same Facility Results table above. \n (e) U.K. EBITDA margin for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was affected by lower census and higher operating expenses including contract labor in particular. Our census did not reach a sufficient level to absorb the higher wages and operating costs, which adversely affected our margins. \nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nRevenue. Revenue increased $176.1 million, or 6.2%, to $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $2.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulting from same facility revenue growth of 5.2% and the increase in the exchange rate between USD and GBP of $36.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated $1.9 billion of revenue, or 63.2% of our total revenue, from our U.S. Facilities and $1.1 billion of revenue, or 36.8% of our total revenue, from our U.K. Facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated $1.8 billion of revenue, or 63.8% of our total revenue, from our U.S. Facilities and $1.0 billion of revenue, or 36.2% of our total revenue, from our U.K. Facilities.\nU.S. same facility revenue increased by $96.7 million, or 5.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, resulting from same facility growth in patient days of 2.7% and an increase in same facility revenue per day of 2.7%. U.S. same facility revenue was impacted by a fourth quarter 2018 accounts receivable adjustment of approximately $8.0 million primarily related to our CTCs and the state Medicaid programs in Wisconsin. U.K. same facility revenue increased by $45.2 million, or 4.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, resulting from same facility growth in patient days of 1.6% and an increase in same facility revenue per day of 3.1%. Consistent with the same facility patient day growth in 2017, the growth in same facility patient days for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from the addition of beds to our existing facilities and ongoing demand for our services.\nSalaries, wages and benefits. Salaries, wages and benefits ( SWB\u201d) expense was $1.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $123.2 million. SWB expense included $22.0 million and $23.5 million of equity-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Excluding equity-based compensation expense, SWB expense was $1.6 billion, or 54.4% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $1.5 billion, or 53.3% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2017. Same facility SWB expense was\n$1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, or 51.6% of revenue compared to $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 51.1% of revenue.\nProfessional fees. Professional fees were $227.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, or 7.5% of revenue, compared to $196.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 6.9% of revenue. The $31.2 million increase was primarily attributable to higher contract labor costs in our U.K. Facilities. Contract labor costs in our U.K. Facilities were higher primarily due to the ongoing nursing and clinical labor shortage and our dependence on higher cost agency labor. Same facility professional fees were $196.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, or 6.8% of revenue, compared to $169.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 6.2% of revenue.\nSupplies. Supplies expense was $119.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, or 4.0% of revenue, compared to $114.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 4.0% of revenue. Same facility supplies expense was $111.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, or 3.9% of revenue, compared to $107.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 3.9% of revenue.\nRents and leases.

Same facility other operating expenses were $329.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, or 11.5% of revenue, compared to $314.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 11.5% of revenue.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense was $158.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, or 5.3% of revenue, compared to $143.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 5.0% of revenue. The increase in depreciation and amortization was attributable to depreciation associated with capital expenditures and real estate acquisitions during 2017 and 2018.\nInterest expense. Interest expense was $185.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $176.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in interest expense was primarily a result of higher interest rates applicable to our variable-rate debt slightly offset by the lower interest rates as a result of the Repricing Facilities Amendments to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.\nDebt extinguishment costs. Debt extinguishment costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 represented $0.6 million of cash charges and $0.3 million of non-cash charges recorded in connection with the Repricing Facilities Amendments to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and $0.9 million of cash charges in connection with the redemption of the 9.0% and 9.5% Revenue Bonds. Debt extinguishment costs for the year ended December 30, 2017 represent $0.5 million of charges and $0.3 of non-cash charges recorded in connection with the Third Repricing Amendment to the Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility.\nLegal settlements expense. Legal settlement costs of $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 represent $19.0 million related to the government investigation of the Company's billing for lab services in West Virginia and $3.1 million related to the resolution of the shareholder class action lawsuit filed in 2011 in connection with our merger with PHC, Inc. d/b/a Pioneer Behavioral Health ( PHC\u201d).\nLoss on impairment. Loss on impairment of $337.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 represents a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $325.9 million and a non-cash long-lived asset impairment charge of $12.0 million related to our U.K. Facilities.\nTransaction-related expenses. Transaction-related expenses were $34.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Transaction-related expenses represent costs incurred in the respective periods primarily related to our acquisitions and related integrated efforts and, for 2018, to the CEO transition.\nIn December 2018, Mr. Joey A. Jacobs was removed from his positions as the CEO and Chairman of the Board of directors (the Board\u201d) of the Company. Also in December 2018, Ms. Debra K. Osteen was elected by the Board to serve as the Company's CEO. In connection with this CEO transition, the Company recorded a charge of $14.0 million, which was comprised of cash payments to\nMr. Jacobs of $8.1 million, the accelerated vesting of Mr. Jacobs' restricted stock awards of $5.0 million, a cash payment to Ms. Osteen of $0.4 million and other costs of $0.5 million. CEO transition costs of $14.0 million were recorded in transaction-related expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nTransaction-related expenses are as summarized below (in thousands):\n\nProvision for income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the provision for income taxes was $6.5 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of (3.9)%, compared to $37.2 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of 15.7%, for 2017. The change in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to the disparity in the accounting treatment and the tax treatment of the loss on impairment recorded in 2018.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRevenue before provision for doubtful accounts. Revenue before provision for doubtful accounts increased $24.4 million, or 0.9%, to $2.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $2.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase related primarily to revenue generated during the year ended December 31, 2017 from the facilities acquired in our 2016 Acquisitions, particularly the acquisition of Priory, offset by the reduction in revenue before provision for doubtful accounts related to the U.K. Divestiture of $154.7 million and the decline in the exchange rate between USD and GBP of $45.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated $1.8 billion of revenue, or 63.8% of our total revenue, from our U.S. Facilities and $1.0 billion of revenue, or 36.2% of our total revenue, from our U.K. Facilities. During year ended December 31, 2016, we generated $1.7 billion of revenue, or 60.5% of our total revenue, from our U.S. Facilities and $1.1 billion of revenue, or 39.5% of our total revenue, from our U.K. Facilities.\nU.S. same facility revenue increased by $109.1 million, or 6.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, resulting from same facility growth in patient days of 4.8% and an increase in same facility revenue per day of 1.7%. U.K. same facility revenue increased by $28.9 million, or 3.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, resulting from same facility growth in patient days of 2.1% and an increase in same facility revenue per day of 1.5%. Consistent with the same facility patient day growth in 2016, the growth in same facility patient days for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted from the addition of beds to our existing facilities and ongoing demand for our services.\nProvision for doubtful accounts. The provision for doubtful accounts was $40.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 1.4% of revenue before provision for doubtful accounts, compared to $41.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 1.5% of revenue before provision for doubtful accounts.\nSalaries, wages and benefits. Salaries, wages and benefits ( SWB\u201d) expense was $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $5.7 million. SWB expense included $23.5 million and $28.3 million of equity-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Excluding equity-based compensation expense, SWB expense was $1.5 billion, or 53.3% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $1.5 billion, or 53.8% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The slight decrease in SWB expense, excluding equity-based compensation expense, was primarily attributable to the reduction in expense related to the U.K. Divestiture and the decline in the exchange rate between USD and GBP offset by SWB expense incurred by the facilities acquired in our 2016 Acquisitions, particularly the acquisition of Priory. Same facility SWB expense was $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 50.9% of revenue compared to $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 51.0% of revenue.\nProfessional fees. Professional fees were $196.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 6.9% of revenue, compared to $185.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 6.6% of revenue. The $10.7 million increase was primarily attributable professional fees incurred by the facilities acquired in our 2016 Acquisitions, particularly the acquisition of Priory, and higher contract labor costs in our U.K. Facilities offset by the reduction in expense related to the U.K. Divestiture and the decline in the exchange rate between USD and GBP. Same facility professional fees were $160.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 6.2% of revenue, compared to $145.0 million, for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 5.9% of revenue.\nSupplies.

The $3.4 million increase was primarily attributable to rents and leases incurred by the facilities acquired in our 2016 Acquisitions, particularly the acquisition of Priory slightly offset by the reduction in expense related to the U.K. Divestiture and the decline in the exchange rate between USD and GBP. Same facility rents and leases were $58.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 2.2% of revenue, compared to $57.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 2.3% of revenue.\nOther operating expenses.

Other operating expenses were $331.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 11.7% of revenue, compared to $312.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 11.1% of revenue. The $19.2 million increase was primarily attributable to other operating expenses incurred by the facilities acquired in our 2016 Acquisitions, particularly the acquisition of Priory slightly offset by the reduction in expense related to the U.K. Divestiture and the decline in the exchange rate between USD and GBP. Same facility other operating expenses were $297.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 11.4% of revenue, compared to $273.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 11.1% of revenue.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense was $143.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 5.0% of revenue, compared to $135.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 4.8% of revenue. The increase in depreciation and amortization was attributable to depreciation associated with capital expenditures during 2016 and 2017 and real estate acquired as part of the 2016 Acquisitions, particularly the acquisition of Priory, offset by reduction in expense related to the U.K. Divestiture and the decline in the exchange rate between USD and GBP.\nInterest expense. Interest expense was $176.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $181.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in interest expense was primarily a result of the lower interest rates in connection with amendments to the Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility and the debt paydown on November 30, 2016 using proceeds from the U.K. Divestiture. Interest expense was also impacted by higher interest rates applicable to our variable-rate debt, borrowings under the Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility and the issuance of the 6.500% Senior Notes on February 16, 2016.\nDebt extinguishment costs. Debt extinguishment costs for the year ended December 30, 2017 represent $0.5 million of charges and $0.3 of non-cash charges recorded in connection with the Third Repricing Amendment to the Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility.

Exchange rate changes between the contract date and the settlement date resulted in a gain on foreign currency derivatives of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nTransaction-related expenses. Transaction-related expenses were $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $48.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Transaction-related expenses represent costs incurred in the respective periods, primarily related to the 2016 Acquisitions, the U.K. Divestiture and the related integration efforts, as summarized below (in thousands):\n\nProvision for income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the provision for income taxes was $37.2 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of 15.7%, compared to $28.8 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of 87.3%, for 2016. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to the Company's estimate of the one-time tax benefit on revaluation of deferred tax items pursuant to the enactment of the Tax Act as well as changes in the foreign exchange rate between USD and GBP in 2017 and the disparity between the accounting treatment and the tax treatment of the U.K. Divestiture on November 30, 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash provided by continuing operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $416.6 million compared to $401.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in cash provided by continuing operating activities was primarily attributable to growth in same facility operations. Days sales outstanding at December 31, 2018 was 39 compared to 38 at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had working capital of $34.0 million and $94.2 million, respectively.\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $361.0 million compared to $336.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

We strive to improve the operating results of our facilities by providing high-quality services, expanding referral networks and marketing initiatives while meeting the increased demand for behavioral healthcare services through expansion of our current locations as well as developing new services within existing locations. At December 31, 2018, we operated 583 behavioral healthcare facilities with approximately 18,100 beds in 40 states, the U.K. and Puerto Rico. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we added 651 beds, including 499 added to existing facilities and 152 added through the opening of two de novo facilities. For the year ending December 31, 2019, we expect to add approximately 700 total beds exclusive of acquisitions.\nWe are the leading publicly traded pure-play provider of behavioral healthcare services, with operations in the U.S. and the U.K. Management believes that we are positioned as a leading platform in a highly fragmented industry under the direction of an\nexperienced management team that has significant industry expertise. Management expects to take advantage of several strategies that are more accessible as a result of our increased size and geographic scale, including continuing a national marketing strategy to attract new patients and referral sources, increasing our volume of out-of-state referrals, providing a broader range of services to new and existing patients and clients and selectively pursuing opportunities to expand our facility and bed count in the U.S. and U.K. through acquisitions, joint ventures and bed additions in existing facilities.\nAcquisitions\n2019 Acquisitions\nOn February 15, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Whittier, an inpatient psychiatric facility with 71 beds located in Haverhill, Massachusetts, for cash consideration of approximately $17.9 million. Also on February 15, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Mission Treatment for cash consideration of approximately $22.5 million and a working capital settlement. Mission Treatment operates nine comprehensive treatment centers in California, Nevada, Arizona and Oklahoma.\n2017 Acquisition\nOn November 13, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Aspire, an education facility with 36 beds located in Scotland, for cash consideration of approximately $21.3 million.\n2016 U.S. Acquisitions\nOn June 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Pocono Mountain, an inpatient psychiatric facility with 108 beds located in Henryville, Pennsylvania, for cash consideration of approximately $25.4 million.\nOn May 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of TrustPoint, an inpatient psychiatric facility with 100 beds located in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, for cash consideration of approximately $62.7 million.\nOn April 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Serenity Knolls, an inpatient psychiatric facility with 30 beds located in Forest Knolls, California, for cash consideration of approximately $10.0 million.\nPriory\nOn February 16, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Priory for a total purchase price of approximately $2.2 billion, including cash consideration of approximately $1.9 billion and the issuance of 4,033,561 shares of our common stock to shareholders of Priory. Priory was the leading independent provider of behavioral healthcare services in the U.K. operating 324 facilities with approximately 7,100 beds at the acquisition date.\nThe Competition and Markets Authority (the CMA\u201d) in the U.K. reviewed our acquisition of Priory. On July 14, 2016, the CMA announced that our acquisition of Priory was referred for a phase 2 investigation unless we offered acceptable undertakings to address the CMA's competition concerns relating to the provision of behavioral healthcare services in certain markets. On July 28, 2016, the CMA announced that we had offered undertakings to address the CMA's concerns and that, in lieu of a phase 2 investigation, the CMA would consider our undertakings.\nOn October 18, 2016, we signed a definitive agreement with BC Partners for the sale of 21 existing U.K. behavioral health facilities and one de novo behavioral health facility with an aggregate of approximately 1,000 beds. On November 10, 2016, the CMA accepted our undertakings to sell the U.K. Disposal Group to BC Partners and confirmed that the divestiture satisfied the CMA's concerns about the impact of our acquisition of Priory on competition for the provision of behavioral healthcare services in certain markets in the U.K. As a result of the CMA's acceptance of our undertakings, our acquisition of Priory was not referred for a phase 2 investigation. On November 30, 2016, we completed the sale of the U.K. Disposal Group to BC Partners for \u00a3320 million cash.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table illustrates our consolidated results of

Management uses Segment EBITDA as an analytical indicator to measure the performance of our segments and to develop strategic objectives and operating plans for those segments. Segment EBITDA is commonly used as an analytical indicator within the health care industry, and also serves as a measure of leverage capacity and debt service ability. Segment EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of financial performance under GAAP, and the items excluded from Segment EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance.

Our census did not reach a sufficient level to absorb the higher wages and operating costs, which adversely affected our margins. \nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nRevenue. Revenue increased $176.1 million, or 6.2%, to $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $2.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulting from same facility revenue growth of 5.2% and the increase in the exchange rate between USD and GBP of $36.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated $1.9 billion of revenue, or 63.2% of our total revenue, from our U.S. Facilities and $1.1 billion of revenue, or 36.8% of our total revenue, from our U.K. Facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated $1.8 billion of revenue, or 63.8% of our total revenue, from our U.S. Facilities and $1.0 billion of revenue, or 36.2% of our total revenue, from our U.K. Facilities.\nU.S. same facility revenue increased by $96.7 million, or 5.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, resulting from same facility growth in patient days of 2.7% and an increase in same facility revenue per day of 2.7%. U.S. same facility revenue was impacted by a fourth quarter 2018 accounts receivable adjustment of approximately $8.0 million primarily related to our CTCs and the state Medicaid programs in Wisconsin. U.K. same facility revenue increased by $45.2 million, or 4.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, resulting from same facility growth in patient days of 1.6% and an increase in same facility revenue per day of 3.1%. Consistent with the same facility patient day growth in 2017, the growth in same facility patient days for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from the addition of beds to our existing facilities and ongoing demand for our services.\nSalaries, wages and benefits. Salaries, wages and benefits ( SWB\u201d) expense was $1.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $123.2 million. SWB expense included $22.0 million and $23.5 million of equity-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Excluding equity-based compensation expense, SWB expense was $1.6 billion, or 54.4% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $1.5 billion, or 53.3% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2017. Same facility SWB expense was\n$1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, or 51.6% of revenue compared to $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 51.1% of revenue.\nProfessional fees. Professional fees were $227.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, or 7.5% of revenue, compared to $196.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 6.9% of revenue. The $31.2 million increase was primarily attributable to higher contract labor costs in our U.K. Facilities. Contract labor costs in our U.K. Facilities were higher primarily due to the ongoing nursing and clinical labor shortage and our dependence on higher cost agency labor. Same facility professional fees were $196.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, or 6.8% of revenue, compared to $169.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 6.2% of revenue.\nSupplies. Supplies expense was $119.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, or 4.0% of revenue, compared to $114.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 4.0% of revenue. Same facility supplies expense was $111.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, or 3.9% of revenue, compared to $107.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 3.9% of revenue.\nRents and leases. Rents and leases were $80.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, or 2.7% of revenue, compared to $76.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 2.7% of revenue. Same facility rents and leases were $64.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, or 2.2% of revenue, compared to $62.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 2.3% of revenue.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses consisted primarily of purchased services, utilities, insurance, travel and repairs and maintenance expenses. Other operating expenses were $354.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, or 11.8% of revenue, compared to $331.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 11.7% of revenue. Same facility other operating expenses were $329.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, or 11.5% of revenue, compared to $314.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 11.5% of revenue.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense was $158.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, or 5.3% of revenue, compared to $143.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 5.0% of revenue. The increase in depreciation and amortization was attributable to depreciation associated with capital expenditures and real estate acquisitions during 2017 and 2018.\nInterest expense. Interest expense was $185.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $176.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in interest expense was primarily a result of higher interest rates applicable to our variable-rate debt slightly offset by the lower interest rates as a result of the Repricing Facilities Amendments to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.\nDebt extinguishment costs. Debt extinguishment costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 represented $0.6 million of cash charges and $0.3 million of non-cash charges recorded in connection with the Repricing Facilities Amendments to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and $0.9 million of cash charges in connection with the redemption of the 9.0% and 9.5% Revenue Bonds. Debt extinguishment costs for the year ended December 30, 2017 represent $0.5 million of charges and $0.3 of non-cash charges recorded in connection with the Third Repricing Amendment to the Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility.\nLegal settlements expense. Legal settlement costs of $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 represent $19.0 million related to the government investigation of the Company's billing for lab services in West Virginia and $3.1 million related to the resolution of the shareholder class action lawsuit filed in 2011 in connection with our merger with PHC, Inc. d/b/a Pioneer Behavioral Health ( PHC\u201d).\nLoss on impairment. Loss on impairment of $337.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 represents a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $325.9 million and a non-cash long-lived asset impairment charge of $12.0 million related to our U.K. Facilities.\nTransaction-related expenses. Transaction-related expenses were $34.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Transaction-related expenses represent costs incurred in the respective periods primarily related to our acquisitions and related integrated efforts and, for 2018, to the CEO transition.\nIn December 2018, Mr. Joey A. Jacobs was removed from his positions as the CEO and Chairman of the Board of directors (the Board\u201d) of the Company. Also in December 2018, Ms. Debra K. Osteen was elected by the Board to serve as the Company's CEO. In connection with this CEO transition, the Company recorded a charge of $14.0 million, which was comprised of cash payments to\nMr. Jacobs of $8.1 million, the accelerated vesting of Mr. Jacobs' restricted stock awards of $5.0 million, a cash payment to Ms. Osteen of $0.4 million and other costs of $0.5 million. CEO transition costs of $14.0 million were recorded in transaction-related expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nTransaction-related expenses are as summarized below (in thousands):\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CEO transition costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Termination and closure costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Legal, accounting and other fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 34,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProvision for income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the provision for income taxes was $6.5 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of (3.9)%, compared to $37.2 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of 15.7%, for 2017. The change in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to the disparity in the accounting treatment and the tax treatment of the loss on impairment recorded in 2018.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRevenue before provision for doubtful accounts. Revenue before provision for doubtful accounts increased $24.4 million, or 0.9%, to $2.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $2.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase related primarily to revenue generated during the year ended December 31, 2017 from the facilities acquired in our 2016 Acquisitions, particularly the acquisition of Priory, offset by the reduction in revenue before provision for doubtful accounts related to the U.K. Divestiture of $154.7 million and the decline in the exchange rate between USD and GBP of $45.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated $1.8 billion of revenue, or 63.8% of our total revenue, from our U.S. Facilities and $1.0 billion of revenue, or 36.2% of our total revenue, from our U.K. Facilities. During year ended December 31, 2016, we generated $1.7 billion of revenue, or 60.5% of our total revenue, from our U.S. Facilities and $1.1 billion of revenue, or 39.5% of our total revenue, from our U.K. Facilities.\nU.S. same facility revenue increased by $109.1 million, or 6.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, resulting from same facility growth in patient days of 4.8% and an increase in same facility revenue per day of 1.7%. U.K. same facility revenue increased by $28.9 million, or 3.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, resulting from same facility growth in patient days of 2.1% and an increase in same facility revenue per day of 1.5%. Consistent with the same facility patient day growth in 2016, the growth in same facility patient days for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted from the addition of beds to our existing facilities and ongoing demand for our services.\nProvision for doubtful accounts.

The slight decrease in SWB expense, excluding equity-based compensation expense, was primarily attributable to the reduction in expense related to the U.K. Divestiture and the decline in the exchange rate between USD and GBP offset by SWB expense incurred by the facilities acquired in our 2016 Acquisitions, particularly the acquisition of Priory. Same facility SWB expense was $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 50.9% of revenue compared to $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 51.0% of revenue.\nProfessional fees.

The $10.7 million increase was primarily attributable professional fees incurred by the facilities acquired in our 2016 Acquisitions, particularly the acquisition of Priory, and higher contract labor costs in our U.K. Facilities offset by the reduction in expense related to the U.K. Divestiture and the decline in the exchange rate between USD and GBP. Same facility professional fees were $160.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 6.2% of revenue, compared to $145.0 million, for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 5.9% of revenue.\nSupplies.

The $3.0 million decrease was primarily attributable to the reduction in expense related to the U.K. Divestiture and the decline in the exchange rate between USD and GBP offset by supplies expense incurred by the facilities acquired in our 2016 Acquisitions, particularly the acquisition of Priory. Same facility supplies expense was $103.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 4.0% of revenue, compared to $100.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 4.1% of revenue.\nRents and leases.

The $3.4 million increase was primarily attributable to rents and leases incurred by the facilities acquired in our 2016 Acquisitions, particularly the acquisition of Priory slightly offset by the reduction in expense related to the U.K. Divestiture and the decline in the exchange rate between USD and GBP. Same facility rents and leases were $58.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 2.2% of revenue, compared to $57.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 2.3% of revenue.\nOther operating expenses.

The $19.2 million increase was primarily attributable to other operating expenses incurred by the facilities acquired in our 2016 Acquisitions, particularly the acquisition of Priory slightly offset by the reduction in expense related to the U.K. Divestiture and the decline in the exchange rate between USD and GBP. Same facility other operating expenses were $297.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 11.4% of revenue, compared to $273.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 11.1% of revenue.\nDepreciation and amortization.

Interest expense was $176.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $181.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in interest expense was primarily a result of the lower interest rates in connection with amendments to the Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility and the debt paydown on November 30, 2016 using proceeds from the U.K. Divestiture. Interest expense was also impacted by higher interest rates applicable to our variable-rate debt, borrowings under the Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility and the issuance of the 6.500% Senior Notes on February 16, 2016.\nDebt extinguishment costs. Debt extinguishment costs for the year ended December 30, 2017 represent $0.5 million of charges and $0.3 of non-cash charges recorded in connection with the Third Repricing Amendment to the Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility.
