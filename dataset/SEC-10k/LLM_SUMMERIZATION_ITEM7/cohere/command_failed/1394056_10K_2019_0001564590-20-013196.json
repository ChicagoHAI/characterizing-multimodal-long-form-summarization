MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and operating results together with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based upon current beliefs, plans and expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors\u201d or in other parts of this Annual Report.\nOverview\nOSS designs, manufactures and markets custom high-speed computing systems for high-performance edge computing (HPC) applications. These applications require ultra-fast processing power and the ability to quickly access and store ever-growing data sets. Systems are built using the latest GPU (graphical processing unit) and solid-state flash (memory) technologies. We are a niche provider of HPC custom servers, compute accelerators, and flash storage arrays. We deliver this technology to customers through sale of equipment and software to customers. Concept Development Inc., (CDI) which was acquired on August 31, 2018, specializes in the design and manufacture of specialized high-performance in-flight entertainment systems for commercial aircraft. CDI's capabilities include electrical, mechanical and software design as well as extensive experience in test and certifications required for airborne systems. Bressner Technology GmbH, (Bressner) which was acquired on October 31, 2018, provides standard and customized servers, panel PCs, and PCIe expansion systems. Bressner provides manufacturing, test, sales and marketing services for customers throughout Europe.\nBusiness Developments\nOn July 15, 2016, we acquired 100% of the outstanding common shares of Mission Technology Group, Inc. ( Magma\u201d). Magma designs, manufactures, and markets industrial grade computer systems and components and operates out of our main facility in Escondido, California.\nOn April 6, 2017, we formed SkyScale, LLC ( SkyScale\u201d), a High-Performance Computing as a Service (HPCaaS) provider to offer customers world-class, ultra-fast, multi-GPU hardware platforms in the cloud. SkyScale was jointly owned with Jacoma Investments, LLC, an entity controlled by our board member Jack Harrison. In accordance with the terms of the operating agreement, Jacoma Investments, LLC agreed to contribute $750,000 in capital and we agreed to contribute $750,000 in the form of credits to purchase equipment, personnel or support services. Each of us received a 50% membership interest. On December 31, 2018, as a result of changes in the competitive landscape and downward pressure on pricing from large competitors, the members to the joint venture agreement agreed to begin the dissolution of SkyScale.\nOn May 9, 2017, we entered into an agreement to acquire the source code license to the Ion flash array software from Western Digital. We plan to continue to develop and sell Ion software with our high-density storage arrays, as well as servicing existing Western Digital software users. OSS Ion software works with our all-flash storage systems, and provides them with a critical point of differentiation with respect to speed and throughput. The OSS Ion software leverages flash storage and open server hardware to accelerate applications and SAN performance through sharing or clustering high-speed all-flash storage arrays. The software supports many major OEM servers and provides an intuitive interface for system users to manage its many features. Having the Ion software source code and engineering team on-board allows us to strategically grow our all-flash storage business in the many Big Data\u201d and HPC markets going forward.\nOn July 1, 2017, we entered in to a Service Agreement with Western Digital to service their existing customer base that utilizes Ion flash storage software. Additionally, we purchased certain equipment from Western Digital and hired selected employees to assist in the servicing of these existing customers.\nOn December 18, 2017, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 with the SEC related to a firm commitment underwritten initial public offering of the Company's common stock, par value $0.0001 per share. The initial public offering was declared effective by the SEC on January 31, 2018. The Company commenced trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol OSS\u201d on February 1, 2018. On February 5, 2018, the Company closed the initial public offering selling an aggregate of 3,800,000 shares of common stock at a price to the public of $5.00 for total gross proceeds to the Company of $19,000,000, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $1,330,000 and underwriter offering-related transaction costs of $185,000, the Company received net proceeds of $17,485,000.\nOn February 1, 2018, the Company issued warrants to purchase 380,000 shares of common stock at a price of $6.00 to Roth Capital Partners LLC.\nSubsequent to completion of the Company's initial public offering in February 2018, the Company used proceeds to pay down the outstanding standing balance of our line of credit of $2,758,517 and other debt obligations $1,096,343.\nOn February 9, 2018, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option to purchase an additional 200,000 shares of common stock at the public offering price of $5.00 per share of which 100,000 newly issued shares of common stock were purchased directly from the Company and 100,000 shares were sold by our former CEO's family trust as selling stockholder. The Company received gross proceeds of $500,000, which resulted in net proceeds of $465,000 to the Company, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $35,000.\nOn August 31, 2018, the Company acquired Concept Development Inc. (CDI) located in Irvine, California for cash of $646,759, and common stock of $4,194,673 (Note 3). CDI specializes in the design and manufacture of custom high-performance computing systems for airborne in-flight entertainment systems.\nOn October 31, 2018, the Company's wholly-owned German subsidiary, OSS GmbH, acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Bressner Technology GmbH, a Germany limited liability company located near Munich, Germany, from its principal owners for cash consideration of \u20ac4,725,000 (US$5,374,582) and stock consideration of 106,463 newly-issued restricted shares of the Company's common stock.\nIn April 2019, certain members of the Company's Board of Directors executed definitive agreements to commit funds of up to $4,000,000 as a credit facility. The Company initially borrowed $1,150,000 from members of the Board of Directors and $350,000 from other shareholders for a two year period at an interest rate of 9.5% which requires the Company to make monthly principal and interest payment of $69,000 per month. In connection with these loans, the Company issued the note holders warrants to purchase shares of the Company's common stock equal to 10% of the original principal as a price per share equal to $2.15 per share. Accordingly, the Company issued to the note holders warrants to purchase 69,766 share of the Company's common stock. The relative fair value of the warrants issued was $60,158.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company sold 1,554,832 shares of common stock through this offering for total gross proceeds of $2,700,714, which resulted in net proceeds to the company of $2,488,148, after deducting compensation payable to Noble of $55,127 and other expenses of $157,439. The Equity Distribution Agreement was terminated on August 26, 2019.\nIn December 2019, a strain of coronavirus surfaced in China. As a result, there have been numerous factory closures. While many factories were closed for a few days because of the Chinese New Year holiday, the Chinese government ordered that businesses in various areas extend the Chinese New Year holiday due to the coronavirus outbreak and it is possible that the Chinese government will announce new closures in the future. Some of our suppliers in China as well as other locations throughout the world have similarly been affected and experienced closures and risks of labor shortages. If our suppliers experience additional closures in the future, we may have difficulty sourcing materials necessary to fulfill production requirements and meet scheduled shipments, which will negatively affect our revenues. Even if we are able to find alternate sources for such materials, they may cost more, which will affect our profitability. If our suppliers in China and other Asian markets experience additional closures in the future and are not able to accept orders or if they delay or cancel such orders, our revenues will be negatively affected. At this point in time, there is significant uncertainty relating to the potential effect of the coronavirus on our business. Infections may become more widespread and there might be additional factory closures in the future, all of which will have a negative impact on our\nbusiness, financial condition and operating results. Additionally, as a result of significant changes in the worldwide capital markets and general business climate, the impact on the future demand for our products is unknown at this time.\nOn February 15, 2020, Steve Cooper was terminated as President and CEO of One Stop Systems, Inc., and was replaced by David Raun who has become interim CEO of the Company.\nOur Business Model\nOSS designs, manufactures and sells specialized high-performance edge computing (HPC) systems to customers world-wide. We differentiate ourselves from other suppliers of HPC solutions by utilizing our high-performance expertise in custom systems design and PCIe expansion to build systems with a greater quantity of PCIe add-in slots, GPU-based compute cards and/or flash cards. Our systems offer industry leading capabilities that occupy less physical space and power consumption.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nOn January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the new accounting standard update ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which superseded nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP, to all contracts using the modified retrospective method. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.\nThe Company's performance obligations are satisfied over time as work is performed or at a point in time. The majority of the Company's revenue is recognized at a point in time when products ship and control is transferred to the customer. The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied.\nThe Company's contracts are executed through a combination of written agreements along with purchase orders with all customers including certain general terms and conditions. Generally, purchase orders entail products, quantities and prices, which define the performance obligations of each party and are approved and accepted by the Company. The Company's contracts with customers do not include extended payment terms. Payment terms vary by contract type and type of customer and generally range from 30 to 60 days from invoice. Additionally, taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer and deposited with the relevant government authority, are excluded from revenue.\nThe transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer adjusted for estimated variable consideration, if any. Variable consideration may include discounts, rights of return, refunds, and other similar obligations. The Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct product and service based on its relative standalone selling price. The standalone selling price for products primarily involves the cost to produce the deliverable plus the anticipated margin and for services is estimated based on the Company's approved list price.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company does not accept product returns unless the items are defective as manufactured. The Company establishes provisions for estimated returns and warranties. In addition, the Company does not typically provide customers with the right to a refund and does not transact for noncash consideration.\nCustomer agreements include one vendor managed inventory program. The Company recognizes revenue under this arrangement when all of the following criteria are met: (i) the goods have been identified separately as belonging to the customer; (ii) the goods are ready for physical shipment to the customer; (iii) the Company does not have the ability to direct the goods to another customer; and (iv) the arrangement was requested by the customer and that the customer has sufficiently explained a substantial business purpose for the arrangement. Management also considers whether the customer's custodial risks are insured and whether modifications to the Company's normal billing and credit terms were required.\nRevenues on certain fixed-price contracts where we provide engineering services, prototypes and completed products are recognized over the contract term based upon percentage of completion or based upon milestones delivered that are provided during the period and compared to milestone goals to be provided over the entire contract. These services require that we perform significant, extensive and complex design, development, modification or implementation of our customers' systems. Performance will often extend over long periods of time, and our right to receive future payment depends on our future performance in accordance with the agreement.\nThe percentage-of-completion methodology involves recognizing probable and reasonably estimable revenue using the percentage of services completed, on a current cumulative cost to estimated total cost basis, using a reasonably consistent profit margin over the period. Due to the long-term nature of these projects, developing the estimates of costs often requires significant judgment. Factors that must be considered in estimating the progress of work completed and ultimate cost of the projects include, but are not limited to, the availability of labor and labor productivity, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and the impact of delayed performance. If changes occur in delivery, productivity or other factors used in developing the estimates of costs or revenues, we revise our cost and revenue estimates, which may result in increases or decreases in revenues and costs, and such revisions are reflected in earnings in the period in which the revision becomes known.\nOn certain contracts with several of the Company's significant customers, the Company receives payments in advance of manufacturing. Advanced payments are recorded as deferred revenue until the revenue recognition criteria described above has been met.\nRelated billings that are in excess of revenue earned are deferred and recorded as a liability on the balance sheet until the related services are provided. The Company recognizes revenues for non-refundable, upfront implementation fees on a straight-line basis over the period beginning with initiation of ongoing services through the end of the contract term.\nCost of revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of costs of materials, costs paid to third-party contract manufacturers (which may include the costs of components), and personnel costs associated with manufacturing and support operations. Personnel costs consist of wages, bonuses, benefits, stock-based compensation expenses. Cost of revenue also includes freight, allocated overhead costs and inventory write-offs and changes to our inventory and warranty reserves. Allocated overhead costs consist of certain facilities and utility costs. We expect cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars with an improvement in margin, as product revenue increases.\nOperating expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of general and administrative, sales and marketing and research and development expenses. Salaries and personnel-related costs, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense, are the most significant components of each category of operating expenses. Operating expenses also include allocated overhead costs for facilities and utility costs.\nGeneral and Administrative - General and administrative expense consists primarily of employee compensation and related expenses for administrative functions including finance, legal, human resources and fees for third-party professional services, as well as allocated overhead. For 2018, general and administrative expenses include the costs related to the dissolution of SkyScale, LLC. We expect our general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in growing the business.\nSales and Marketing - Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of employee compensation and related expenses, sales commissions, marketing programs, travel and entertainment expenses as well as allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, tradeshows, events, corporate communications and brand-building activities. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our sales force, increase marketing resources, and further develop sales channels.\nResearch and Development - Research and development expense consists primarily of employee compensation and related expenses, prototype expenses, depreciation associated with assets acquired for research and development, third-party engineering and contractor support costs, as well as allocated overhead. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in new and existing products.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income consists of income received for activities outside of our core business. This includes interest income from investments and finance charges from customers. Other expense includes expenses for activities outside of our core business. These expenses consist primarily of loan amortization and interest expense.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists of estimated income taxes due to the United States and German governments as well as state tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we conduct business, along with the change in our deferred income tax assets and liabilities.\nResults of Operations\nResults of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 include Magma, SkyScale (through December 31, 2018 dissolution date), the Ion business from Western Digital on July 1, 2017, Concept Development Inc., which was acquired on August 31, 2018, and Bressner Technology GmbH, which was acquired on October 31, 2018.\nAccordingly, the periods presented below are not directly comparable. After the completion of four quarters, these businesses for both revenue and expense reporting will be treated as organic operating activity for current and comparable historical periods. The following tables set forth our results of continued operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 respectively, presented in dollars and as percentage of net revenue.\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 respectively, presented in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue.\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe believe that the use of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or adjusted EBITDA, is helpful for an investor to assess the performance of the Company. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, acquisition expense, impairment of long-lived assets, financing costs, fair value adjustments from purchase accounting, stock-based compensation expense and expenses related to discontinued operations.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of equity instruments that can impact a company's non-cash operating expenses, we believe that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-cash and non-recurring expenses allows for meaningful comparisons between our core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing us with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating our own core business operating results over different periods of time.\nOur adjusted EBITDA measure may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies in our industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring and unusual items. Our adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or as an indication of operating performance or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. We do not consider adjusted EBITDA to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results.\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (900,337\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,136,278\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,655,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,350,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of debt discount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of deferred gain\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (57,675\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (134,640\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of goodwill\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,697,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 649,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 527,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 165,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 65,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (151,113\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (85,710\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost resulting from dissolution of SkyScale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (146,150\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 705,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition expenses (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 664,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Benefit for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 237,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,396,784\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,175,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 584,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Expenses incurred in the acquisition of CDI and Bressner.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EPS\nAdjusted EPS excludes the impact of certain items and, therefore, has not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that exclusion of certain selected items assists in providing a more complete understanding of our underlying results and trends and allows for comparability with our peer company index and industry. We use this measure along with the corresponding GAAP financial measures to manage our business and to evaluate our performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace. The Company defines non-GAAP (loss) income attributable to common stockholders as (loss) or income before amortization, stock-based compensation, expenses related to discontinued operations, and acquisition costs. Adjusted EPS expresses adjusted (loss) income on a per share basis using weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\nAdjusted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. We expect to continue to incur expenses similar to the adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted EPS financial adjustments described above, and investors should not infer from our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures that these costs are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring.\nThe following table reconciles net loss attributable to common stockholders and diluted earnings per share:\nTable 156: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (900,337\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,136,278\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of intangibles\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 984,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 630,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of goodwill\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,697,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 649,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 527,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost resulting from dissolution of SkyScale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (146,150\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 705,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 664,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,288,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,391,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-GAAP net income per share attributable to common stockholders:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average common shares outstanding:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,148,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,586,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,158,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,741,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFree cash flow, a non-GAAP measure for reporting cash flow, is defined as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures for property and equipment, which includes capitalized software development costs. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on cash available for investments and acquisitions after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long-term value creation. We believe that trends in our free cash flow can be valuable indicators of our operating performance and liquidity.\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP.

The increase in revenue was primarily driven by revenue from acquisitions which provided $16,278,668 of which Bressner contributed $14,496,593 or 39.2 percentage points and CDI contributed $1,782,075 or 4.8 percentage points of the total increase in revenue. OSS saw an increase in revenue of $5,160,483 or 13.9 percentage points as compared to same period in the prior year. The majority of this increase is attributable to shipments associated with our flash arrays on our airborne military flash contract as well as improvements in our sales of media and entertainment products. There was also a small decrease of $(158,514) or a decrease of (0.4) percentage points attributable to SkyScale which has been dissolved.\nCost of revenue and gross profit\nCost of revenue increased by $13,213,097 or 51.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily driven by cost of revenue from acquisitions which contributed $12,562,168 of which Bressner contributed $11,346,707 or 44.2 percentage points and CDI contributed $1,215,461or 4.7 percentage points of the total increase in cost of revenue. OSS saw an increase in cost of revenue of $1,325,988 or 5.2 percentage points as compared to same period in the prior year. This change is attributable to a reduction of $957,693 in applied labor and overhead into inventory from the previous year, offset by costs of goods associated with increased sales of our flash array systems and media and entertainment products in the current year. There was also a decrease of $(675,059) or a decrease of (2.6) percentage points attributable to SkyScale which has been dissolved.\nThe overall gross margin percentage increase from 30.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 33.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of 2.7 percentage points. OSS gross margin percentage for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 39.2%, which was 5.6 percentage points more in comparison to the prior year period of 33.6%. The 5.6 percentage point increase is attributable to change in mix attributable to higher sales of our flash array systems. CDI contributed gross margin at a rate of 22.6% due to cost engineering projects on fixed price contracts, while Bressner contributed gross margin at a rate of 22.5%.\nOperating expenses\nGeneral and administrative expense\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $1,988,274 or 30.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to same period in 2018. OSS experienced a reduction of $(379,882) or (19.0%) of the total annual increase in these expenses. The decrease in general and administrative expense for OSS was primarily attributable to not incurring acquisition costs in the current year which was a saving of approximately $628,000 as compared to the prior year, costs associated with the winding down of SkyScale in the prior year which resulted in a savings of approximately $778,000 and a reduction in amortization expense. These savings were offset by some degree by additional compensation costs and third party service costs associated with being a public company which includes legal, accounting costs, insurance, listing fees and reporting and compliance costs and employee costs. CDI contributed $871,422 or 43.8% which is attributable to a full year of operations as compared to only four months of activity in 2018, as a result of being acquired on August 31, 2018. Bressner contributed $1,855,458 or 93.3% of the total annual increase, which is attributable to a full year of operations as compared to only two months of activity in 2018, as a result of being acquired on October 31, 2018. There was also a decrease of $(358,724) or (18.1%) attributable to SkyScale which has been dissolved. Overall general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue to 14.6% during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 17.6% during the same period in 2018.\nImpairment of goodwill\nDuring the current year, the Company took a write-down of $1,697,394 attributable to impairment of goodwill of CDI due to a short-fall in the actual overall financial performance of CDI as compared to plan, a recurring need for working capital, and a decrease in the overall Company's stock price. There was no such impairment charge in 2018.\nMarketing and selling expense\nMarketing and selling expense increased $1,143,234 or 28.6% during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018. OSS had an increase of $172,128 or 15.1% of the total increase. There was also a reduction in marketing and selling expense of $(132,004) or (11.6%) as a result of the dissolution of SkyScale. CDI's marketing expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $195,295 or 17.1%, which represented twelve months of activity as compared to the prior year which included only four months of activity. Bressner contributed $907,815 or 79.4% which represented twelve months of activity as compared to the prior year which included only two months of activity. Overall, total marketing and selling expense decreased as a percentage of revenue to 8.8% during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 10.8% during the same period in 2018.\nResearch and development expense\nResearch and development expense increased by $841,799 or 21% during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to same period in 2018. OSS saw an increase of $291,643 or 34.7%. The increase was largely driven by increased employee compensation costs. CDI contributed $240,154 or 28.5% of the annual increase while Bressner contributed $310,002 or 36.8% of the annual increase for 2019. Overall, total research and development expense decreased as a percentage of revenue to 8.3% during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 10.8% during the same period in 2018.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense increased $99,867 or 152% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018. The Company borrowed $1,500,000 from individuals and related parties at an annual interest rate of 9.5%, additionally, warrants of 10% of the value of the borrowing were also granted. The fair value of the warrants is amortized over the life of the loans and such costs are included as interest expense. On October 31, 2018, the Company acquired Bressner which has a line of credit and certain term loans outstanding and as a result, incurred interest charges of $39,292 during the year. The outstanding debt associated with OSS in 2018 was paid down in its entirety with proceeds from its public offering in February 2018.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), for the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted in income of $281,494 as compared to $271,877 in the same period in 2018. The majority of the income for the current year is attributable to interest earned by OSS of $151,113 on deposits, and interest on outstanding customer invoices that were on extended terms. Additionally, the Company recognized a benefit of $208,332 from estimated expenses that had been accrued in the dissolution process of SkyScale which were not realized. This other income was offset during the period by foreign currency transactions losses.\nProvision for income taxes / Income tax benefits\nWe have recorded an income tax benefit of $54,055, for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to tax benefits of $1,396,784, for the same period in 2018. The provision for the current period is attributable to annual taxable income for 2019 of $1,772,975 with a projected tax rate of 13.4%. The projected effective tax rate for the year differs from the statutory rate mainly due to permanent non-deductible goodwill amortization for Bressner Technology GmbH, income from the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income inclusion, as well as projecting federal, foreign and state tax liabilities for the year.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nGiven our recent operating losses, the Company's primary sources of liquidity have been provided by (i) the Company's February 2018 initial public offering (net proceeds were approximately $16,100,000), (ii) March 2019 notes payable from members of the Board of Directors and others of $1,500,000, and (iii) the June 2019 sale of 1,554,832 shares of the Company's common stock for net cash proceeds of $2,488,148.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company's cash and cash equivalents were approximately $5,200,000 and working capital approximated $14,000,000. Cash and cash equivalents held by Bressner totaled $745,000 (USD) at December 31, 2019, and Bressner's debt covenants do not permit the use of those funds by its parent company. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company experienced an operating loss of $779,000, but cash flows provided by operating activities approximated $2,400,000.\nThe Company's revenue growth, inclusive of two acquisitions made in 2018, has resulted in growth of the Company as a whole, but has been offset by increased spending in all areas of operating expenses: general and administrative, marketing and selling, and research and development. Further, in late 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was first detected in Wuhan, China. Following the outbreak of this virus, governments throughout the world, including in the United States of America, have quarantined certain affected regions, restricted travel and imposed significant limitations on other economic activities. The Company's operations team is closely monitoring the potential impact to the Company's business, including its cash flows, supply chains, customers and employees. Though management has successfully managed through the current known impacts, if the situation further deteriorates or the outbreak results in further restriction on both supply and demand factors, our cash flows, financial position and operating results for fiscal year 2020 and beyond will be negatively impacted. Neither the length of time nor the magnitude of the negative impacts can be presently determined.\nManagement's plans with respect to the above is to continue its efforts to restructure the Company with the primary objectives of reducing costs, conserving cash, strengthening margins, and improving company-wide execution. Specific actions already implemented by management include the deferral of certain executive and Board compensation payments, a freeze on hiring and minimizing overtime, travel and entertainment, and contractor costs. In addition, management continues to review its expenses on a line item-by-line item basis for cost reduction opportunities, as well as opportunities to increase efficiencies through automation.\nWhile management expects these actions to result in prospective cost reductions, management is also committed to securing debt and/or equity financing to ensure that liquidity will be sufficient to meet the Company's cash requirements through at least a period of the next twelve months. Management believes potential sources of liquidity include at least the following:\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25aa\n</td> <td> In March 2019, the Company received funding commitments in the amount of $4,000,000 from members of the Board of Directors, of which $1,500,000 has been drawn through December 31, 2019.

However, there can be no assurance that management's cost reduction efforts will be effective, the forecasted cash flows will be achieved, or that external sources of financing,\nincluding the issuance of debt and/or equity securities, will be available at times and on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 162: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,374,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,890,786\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,385,177\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5,909,192\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,922,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,900,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated $2,374,868 in cash from operating activities, an increase in cash of $6,265,654 when compared to the cash used in operating activities of $3,890,786 during the same period in 2018. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily a result of a reduction in working capital requirements of $2,392,755, a reduction in net loss of $235,941, and an increase in non-cash adjustments of $3,636,958. Non-cash adjustments include increases of $4,049,059 comprised of the loss attributable to noncontrolling interest, deferred benefit for income taxes, loss on foreign currency transactions, provision for bad debt, impairment of goodwill, amortization of deferred gain, depreciation and amortization, inventory reserves, stock-based compensation expense an unrealized loss on forward currency contracts. These increases were offset by $(412,101) in decreases in non-cash adjustments attributable to, gain on disposal of property and equipment, provision, warranty reserves, and amortization of debt discount.\nWorking capital requirements decreased overall by $2,392,755. The sources of working capital of $3,770,079 were attributable to reductions in accounts receivable and prepaids and other assets, and increases in accounts payable for the comparable period. These sources were offset by uses of working capital due to increased inventory levels and reduced accrued expenses and other liabilities of $1,377,324.\nOur ability to generate cash from operations in future periods will depend in large part on our profitability, the rate and timing of collections of our accounts receivable, our inventory turns and our ability to manage other areas of working capital including accounts payable.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we used cash of $2,385,177 in investing activities as compared to $5,909,192 used during the same period in 2018, a decrease of $1,850,567. The expenditures in the current year are primarily due to tenant improvements to our headquarter facility and software costs and external consulting costs associated with the implementation of our ERP system for which phase one of the project was substantially completed in 2019. We currently do not anticipate any other significant purchases of equipment nor expansion of our ERP system beyond completion of phase II of the project, which is the integration of certain sales functions.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated $2,922,101 from financing activities as compared to the cash generated of $11,900,178 during the same period in 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we raised $1,500,000 from individuals and related parties through the issuance of notes payable that bear interest at an annual rate of 9.5% and are repaid through 24 months monthly installments. Additionally, during the third quarter of the year, the Company sold 1,554,832 shares of common stock for total gross proceeds of $2,700,714, which after commissions to brokers and other expenses resulted in net proceeds to us of $2,488,148. The Company also received proceeds of $47,334 from the exercise of warrants and stock options.\nBressner increased borrowing under its lines of credit for the purchase of inventories and also borrowed funds through term loans at interest rates of 2.125% - 2.250% that are repaid through monthly installments of up to 24 months.\nDuring year ended December 31, 2018, the Company received proceeds from the sale of common stock in our initial public offering of $19,500,000 which was offset by our stock issuance costs for commissions and third party professional services. We also received $113,168 from the exercise of warrants and stock options. With the proceeds from our initial public offering, we paid off our line of credit and retired all outstanding debt obligations.\nContractual obligations and commitments\nThe following table sets forth our non-cancellable contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019.\nTable 163: <table> <tr> <td> Contractual Obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Notes payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,327,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,969,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 358,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,414,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 713,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,489,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 211,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,742,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,682,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,847,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 211,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have made certain indemnities, under which the Company may be required to make payments to an indemnified party, in relation to certain transactions. We indemnify our directors, officers, employees and agents to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of the State of Delaware. In connection with our facilities leases, we indemnify our lessors for certain claims arising from the use of our facilities. The duration of the indemnities varies, and in many cases is indefinite. These indemnities do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential future payments we could be obligated to make. Historically, we have not been obligated to make any payments for these obligations and no liabilities have been recorded for these indemnities.\nOff balance sheet arrangements\nOther than lease commitments incurred in the normal course of business and certain indemnification provisions, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities, guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in transferred assets, or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity.\nWe do not have any majority-owned subsidiaries that are not consolidated in the financial statements. Additionally, we do not have an interest in, or relationships with, any special purpose entities.\nStockholder transactions\nEffective August 1, 2016, we entered into a management services agreement with a company owned by the former Chief Executive Officer of Magma. The agreement called for payments of $180,000 per year for the first two years paid in monthly installments. In year three, the amount was reduced to $37,500 for the year paid in monthly installments. Additionally, we granted 30,000 options in conjunction with execution of this agreement. Payments for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $21,875 and $120,635, respectively. Such management services agreement has been now fully completed.\nIn April 2019, certain members of the Company's Board of Directors executed definitive agreements to commit funds of up to $4,000,000 as a credit facility. The Company initially borrowed $1,150,000 from members of the Board of Directors and $350,000 from other shareholders for a two year period at an interest rate of 9.5% which requires the Company to make monthly principal and interest payment of $69,000 per month. In connection with these loans, the Company issued the note holders warrants to purchase shares of the Company's common stock equal to 10% of the original principal as a price per share equal to $2.15 per share. Accordingly, the Company issued to the note holders warrants to purchase 69,766 shares of the Company's common stock. The relative fair value of the warrants issued was $60,158.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we\nbelieve to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates. The critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nOn January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the new accounting standard update ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which superseded nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP, to all contracts using the modified retrospective method. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.\nThe Company's performance obligations are satisfied over time as work is performed or at a point in time. The majority of the Company's revenue is recognized at a point in time when products ship and control is transferred to the customer. The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied.\nThe Company's contracts are executed through a combination of written agreements along with purchase orders with all customers including certain general terms and conditions. Generally, purchase orders entail products, quantities and prices, which define the performance obligations of each party and are approved and accepted by the Company. The Company's contracts with customers do not include extended payment terms. Payment terms vary by contract type and type of customer and generally range from 30 to 60 days from invoice. Additionally, taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer and deposited with the relevant government authority, are excluded from revenue.\nThe transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer adjusted for estimated variable consideration, if any. Variable consideration may include discounts, rights of return, refunds, and other similar obligations. The Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct product and service based on its relative standalone selling price. The standalone selling price for products primarily involves the cost to produce the deliverable plus the anticipated margin and for services is estimated based on the Company's approved list price.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company does not accept product returns unless the items are defective as manufactured. The Company establishes provisions for estimated returns and warranties. In addition, the Company does not typically provide customers with the right to a refund and does not transact for noncash consideration.\nCustomer agreements include one vendor managed inventory program. The Company recognizes revenue under this arrangement when all of the following criteria are met: (i) the goods have been identified separately as belonging to the customer; (ii) the goods are ready for physical shipment to the customer; (iii) the Company does not have the ability to direct the goods to another customer; and (iv) the arrangement was requested by the customer and that the customer has sufficiently explained a substantial business purpose for the arrangement. Management also considers whether the customer's custodial risks are insured and whether modifications to the Company's normal billing and credit terms were required.\nRevenues on certain fixed-price contracts where we provide engineering services, prototypes and completed products are recognized based upon percentage of completion or based upon milestones delivered that are provided during the period and compared to milestone goals to be provided over the entire contract. These services require that we perform significant, extensive and complex design, development, modification or implementation of our customers' systems. Performance will often extend over long periods of time, and our right to receive future payment depends on our future performance in accordance with the agreement.\nThe percentage-of-completion methodology involves recognizing probable and reasonably estimable revenue using the percentage of services completed, on a current cumulative cost to estimated total cost basis, using a reasonably consistent profit margin over the performance period. Due to the long-term nature of these projects, developing the estimates of costs often requires significant judgment. Factors that must be considered in estimating the progress of work completed and ultimate cost of the projects include, but are not limited to, the availability of labor and labor productivity, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and the impact of delayed performance. If changes occur in delivery, productivity or other factors used in developing the estimates of costs or revenues, we revise our cost and revenue estimates, which may result in increases or decreases in revenues and costs, and such revisions are reflected in earnings in the period in which the revision becomes known.\nOn certain contracts with several of the Company's significant customers, the Company receives payments in advance of manufacturing. Advanced payments are recorded as deferred revenue until the revenue recognition criteria described above has been met.\nRelated billings that are in excess of revenue earned are deferred and recorded as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet until the related services are provided. Deferred revenue was $24,718 and $133,995 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company recognizes revenues for non-refundable, upfront implementation fees on a straight-line basis over the period beginning with initiation of ongoing services through the end of the contract term.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards granted to our employees and other service providers, including stock options granted under the 2017 Plan and 2015 Stock Option Plan that was approved in December 2015 (the 2015 Plan\u201d), based on the estimated fair value of the award. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards granted under the 2017 Plan and 2015 Plan. We recognize the fair value of stock options granted under the 2017 Plan and 2015 Plan as stock-based compensation on a straight line basis over the requisite service period. We record expense net of anticipated forfeitures and adjust the annual expense based upon actual experience.\nCompensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related service period. The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period.\nOur use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the fair value of the underlying common stock, expected term of the option, expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. The assumptions used in our option pricing model represent management's best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nThese assumptions and estimates are as follows:\nTable 164: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Fair Value of Common Stock. Since the completion of our IPO, we use the closing quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 165: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Expected Term. The expected term represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. The expected term assumptions were determined based on the vesting terms and contractual lives of the options, using the simplified method.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Expected Volatility. Since we do not have sufficient trading history of our common stock, the expected volatility was determined based on the historical stock volatilities of comparable companies. Comparable companies consist of public companies in our industry that is similar in size, stage of life cycle and financial leverage. We intend to continue to apply this process using the same or similar public companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own share price becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the identified companies are no longer similar to us, in which case, more suitable companies whose share prices are publicly available would be used in the calculation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Risk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Dividend Rate. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future, and, therefore, use an expected dividend yield of zero.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our stock-based compensation on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may refine our estimation process, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.\nInventory Valuation\nWe value our inventory at the lower of cost or its estimated net realizable value. We use the average cost method for purposes of determining cost, which approximates the first-in, first-out method. We write down inventory for excess and obsolescence based upon a review of historical usage and assumptions about future demand, product mix and possible alternative uses. Actual demand, product mix and alternative usage may be lower than those that we project and this difference could have a material adverse effect on our gross margin if inventory write-downs beyond those initially recorded become necessary. Alternatively, if actual demand, product mix and alternative usage are more favorable than those we estimated at the time of such a write-down, our gross margin could be favorably impacted in future periods.\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-lived Assets\nWe evaluate our goodwill, intangible and long-lived assets for impairment when events or circumstances arise that indicate our goodwill, intangible and long-assets may be impaired. Indicators of impairment include, but are not limited to, a significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, a decline in our market capitalization, the loss of significant business, significant decreases in funding for our contracts, or other significant adverse changes in industry or market conditions. Regardless, goodwill is tested for potential impairment at least annually.\nIncome Taxes\nThe determination of income tax expense requires us to make certain estimates and judgments concerning the calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as the deductions and credits that are available to reduce taxable income. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our consolidated financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.\nIn evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, our forecast of future earnings, future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment. We record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset will be used for which a reserve has been provided, we reverse the related valuation allowance. If our actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction differs from estimates, additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary.\nWe use a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination. If the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We reevaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and any changes to these positions as a result of tax audits, tax laws or other facts and circumstances could result in additional charges to operations.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe utilize the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations and allocate the purchase price of an acquisition to the various tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. We primarily establish fair value using the income approach based upon a discounted cash flow model. The income approach requires the use of many assumptions and estimates including future revenues and expenses, as well as discount factors and income tax rates. Other estimates include:\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Estimated step-ups or write-downs for fixed assets and inventory;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Estimated fair values of intangible assets; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Estimated income tax assets and liabilities assumed from the target\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhile we use our best estimates and assumptions as part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the business acquisition date, our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the purchase price allocation period, which is generally no longer than one year from the business acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill.\nFor changes in the valuation of intangible assets between preliminary and final purchase price allocation, the related amortization is adjusted in the period it occurs. Subsequent to the purchase price allocation period any adjustment to assets acquired or liabilities assumed is included in operating results in the period in which the adjustment is determined. Should we issue shares of our common stock in an acquisition, we will be required to estimate the fair value of the shares issued.\nRecently implemented accounting pronouncements\nPer the Company's consolidated financial statements Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies, we have implemented a number of changes, as required by FASB. See Note 2 for further details.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nPer the Company's consolidated financial statements Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies, we may be implementing a number of changes, as required by FASB. See Note 2 for further details.\nInterest rate risk\nOur exposure to interest rate risk is primarily associated with borrowing on revolving lines of credit denominated in both U.S. dollars and Euros. We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our borrowing activities for our variable rate borrowings.\nConcentration of credit risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially expose us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable. We place our cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions with high credit quality. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $5,185,321 and $2,272,256 respectively, of cash and cash equivalents on deposit or invested with our financial and lending institutions. In Germany, the deposit insurance is \u20ac100,000 per bank, per customer. Bressner has funds on deposit in both Euro and U.S. dollar denominations of \u20ac508,316 (US$570,686) with banks in excess of the insurance limits.\nWe provide credit to our customers in the normal course of business. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition and limit the amount of credit extended when deemed necessary.\nForeign currency risk\nWe operate primarily in the United States. Foreign sales of products and services are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. We also conduct business outside the United States through our foreign subsidiary in Germany, where business is largely transacted in non-U.S. dollar currencies particularly the Euro, which is subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Accordingly, we are subject to exposure from changes in the exchange rates of local currencies. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nOSS GmbH operates as an extension of OSS' domestic operations and acquired Bressner Technology GmbH in October 2018. The functional currency of OSS GmbH is the Euro. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured to the functional currency at the average exchange rate in effect during the period. At the end of each reporting period, monetary assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Consequently, changes in the exchange rates of the currencies may impact the translation of the foreign subsidiaries' statements of operations into U.S. dollars, which may in turn affect our consolidated statement of operations. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe employ derivatives to manage certain currency market risks through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Our derivatives are designated as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedge). We hedge a portion of the exchange risk involved in anticipation of highly probable foreign currency-denominated transactions. In anticipation of these transactions, we enter into foreign exchange contracts to provide currency at a fixed rate.", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I am unable to complete your request because I am

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and operating results together with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based upon current beliefs, plans and expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors\u201d or in other parts of this Annual Report.\nOverview\nOSS designs, manufactures and markets custom high-speed computing systems for high-performance edge computing (HPC) applications. These applications require ultra-fast processing power and the ability to quickly access and store ever-growing data sets. Systems are built using the latest GPU (graphical processing unit) and solid-state flash (memory) technologies. We are a niche provider of HPC custom servers, compute accelerators, and flash storage arrays. We deliver this technology to customers through sale of equipment and software to customers. Concept Development Inc., (CDI) which was acquired on August 31, 2018, specializes in the design and manufacture of specialized high-performance in-flight entertainment systems for commercial aircraft. CDI's capabilities include electrical, mechanical and software design as well as extensive experience in test and certifications required for airborne systems. Bressner Technology GmbH, (Bressner) which was acquired on October 31, 2018, provides standard and customized servers, panel PCs, and PCIe expansion systems. Bressner provides manufacturing, test, sales and marketing services for customers throughout Europe.\nBusiness Developments\nOn July 15, 2016, we acquired 100% of the outstanding common shares of Mission Technology Group, Inc. ( Magma\u201d). Magma designs, manufactures, and markets industrial grade computer systems and components and operates out of our main facility in Escondido, California.\nOn April 6, 2017, we formed SkyScale, LLC ( SkyScale\u201d), a High-Performance Computing as a Service (HPCaaS) provider to offer customers world-class, ultra-fast, multi-GPU hardware platforms in the cloud. SkyScale was jointly owned with Jacoma Investments, LLC, an entity controlled by our board member Jack Harrison. In accordance with the terms of the operating agreement, Jacoma Investments, LLC agreed to contribute $750,000 in capital and we agreed to contribute $750,000 in the form of credits to purchase equipment, personnel or support services. Each of us received a 50% membership interest. On December 31, 2018, as a result of changes in the competitive landscape and downward pressure on pricing from large competitors, the members to the joint venture agreement agreed to begin the dissolution of SkyScale.\nOn May 9, 2017, we entered into an agreement to acquire the source code license to the Ion flash array software from Western Digital. We plan to continue to develop and sell Ion software with our high-density storage arrays, as well as servicing existing Western Digital software users. OSS Ion software works with our all-flash storage systems, and provides them with a critical point of differentiation with respect to speed and throughput. The OSS Ion software leverages flash storage and open server hardware to accelerate applications and SAN performance through sharing or clustering high-speed all-flash storage arrays. The software supports many major OEM servers and provides an intuitive interface for system users to manage its many features. Having the Ion software source code and engineering team on-board allows us to strategically grow our all-flash storage business in the many Big Data\u201d and HPC markets going forward.\nOn July 1, 2017, we entered in to a Service Agreement with Western Digital to service their existing customer base that utilizes Ion flash storage software. Additionally, we purchased certain equipment from Western Digital and hired selected employees to assist in the servicing of these existing customers.\nOn December 18, 2017, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 with the SEC related to a firm commitment underwritten initial public offering of the Company's common stock, par value $0.0001 per share. The initial public offering was declared effective by the SEC on January 31, 2018. The Company commenced trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol OSS\u201d on February 1, 2018. On February 5, 2018, the Company closed the initial public offering selling an aggregate of 3,800,000 shares of common stock at a price to the public of $5.00 for total gross proceeds to the Company of $19,000,000, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $1,330,000 and underwriter offering-related transaction costs of $185,000, the Company received net proceeds of $17,485,000.\nOn February 1, 2018, the Company issued warrants to purchase 380,000 shares of common stock at a price of $6.00 to Roth Capital Partners LLC.\nSubsequent to completion of the Company's initial public offering in February 2018, the Company used proceeds to pay down the outstanding standing balance of our line of credit of $2,758,517 and other debt obligations $1,096,343.\nOn February 9, 2018, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option to purchase an additional 200,000 shares of common stock at the public offering price of $5.00 per share of which 100,000 newly issued shares of common stock were purchased directly from the Company and 100,000 shares were sold by our former CEO's family trust as selling stockholder. The Company received gross proceeds of $500,000, which resulted in net proceeds of $465,000 to the Company, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $35,000.\nOn August 31, 2018, the Company acquired Concept Development Inc. (CDI) located in Irvine, California for cash of $646,759, and common stock of $4,194,673 (Note 3). CDI specializes in the design and manufacture of custom high-performance computing systems for airborne in-flight entertainment systems.\nOn October 31, 2018, the Company's wholly-owned German subsidiary, OSS GmbH, acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Bressner Technology GmbH, a Germany limited liability company located near Munich, Germany, from its principal owners for cash consideration of \u20ac4,725,000 (US$5,374,582) and stock consideration of 106,463 newly-issued restricted shares of the Company's common stock.\nIn April 2019, certain members of the Company's Board of Directors executed definitive agreements to commit funds of up to $4,000,000 as a credit facility. The Company initially borrowed $1,150,000 from members of the Board of Directors and $350,000 from other shareholders for a two year period at an interest rate of 9.5% which requires the Company to make monthly principal and interest payment of $69,000 per month. In connection with these loans, the Company issued the note holders warrants to purchase shares of the Company's common stock equal to 10% of the original principal as a price per share equal to $2.15 per share. Accordingly, the Company issued to the note holders warrants to purchase 69,766 share of the Company's common stock. The relative fair value of the warrants issued was $60,158.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company sold 1,554,832 shares of common stock through this offering for total gross proceeds of $2,700,714, which resulted in net proceeds to the company of $2,488,148, after deducting compensation payable to Noble of $55,127 and other expenses of $157,439. The Equity Distribution Agreement was terminated on August 26, 2019.\nIn December 2019, a strain of coronavirus surfaced in China. As a result, there have been numerous factory closures. While many factories were closed for a few days because of the Chinese New Year holiday, the Chinese government ordered that businesses in various areas extend the Chinese New Year holiday due to the coronavirus outbreak and it is possible that the Chinese government will announce new closures in the future. Some of our suppliers in China as well as other locations throughout the world have similarly been affected and experienced closures and risks of labor shortages. If our suppliers experience additional closures in the future, we may have difficulty sourcing materials necessary to fulfill production requirements and meet scheduled shipments, which will negatively affect our revenues. Even if we are able to find alternate sources for such materials, they may cost more, which will affect our profitability. If our suppliers in China and other Asian markets experience additional closures in the future and are not able to accept orders or if they delay or cancel such orders, our revenues will be negatively affected. At this point in time, there is significant uncertainty relating to the potential effect of the coronavirus on our business. Infections may become more widespread and there might be additional factory closures in the future, all of which will have a negative impact on our\nbusiness, financial condition and operating results. Additionally, as a result of significant changes in the worldwide capital markets and general business climate, the impact on the future demand for our products is unknown at this time.\nOn February 15, 2020, Steve Cooper was terminated as President and CEO of One Stop Systems, Inc., and was replaced by David Raun who has become interim CEO of the Company.\nOur Business Model\nOSS designs, manufactures and sells specialized high-performance edge computing (HPC) systems to customers world-wide. We differentiate ourselves from other suppliers of HPC solutions by utilizing our high-performance expertise in custom systems design and PCIe expansion to build systems with a greater quantity of PCIe add-in slots, GPU-based compute cards and/or flash cards. Our systems offer industry leading capabilities that occupy less physical space and power consumption.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nOn January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the new accounting standard update ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which superseded nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP, to all contracts using the modified retrospective method. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.\nThe Company's performance obligations are satisfied over time as work is performed or at a point in time. The majority of the Company's revenue is recognized at a point in time when products ship and control is transferred to the customer. The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied.\nThe Company's contracts are executed through a combination of written agreements along with purchase orders with all customers including certain general terms and conditions. Generally, purchase orders entail products, quantities and prices, which define the performance obligations of each party and are approved and accepted by the Company. The Company's contracts with customers do not include extended payment terms. Payment terms vary by contract type and type of customer and generally range from 30 to 60 days from invoice. Additionally, taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer and deposited with the relevant government authority, are excluded from revenue.\nThe transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer adjusted for estimated variable consideration, if any. Variable consideration may include discounts, rights of return, refunds, and other similar obligations. The Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct product and service based on its relative standalone selling price. The standalone selling price for products primarily involves the cost to produce the deliverable plus the anticipated margin and for services is estimated based on the Company's approved list price.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company does not accept product returns unless the items are defective as manufactured. The Company establishes provisions for estimated returns and warranties. In addition, the Company does not typically provide customers with the right to a refund and does not transact for noncash consideration.\nCustomer agreements include one vendor managed inventory program. The Company recognizes revenue under this arrangement when all of the following criteria are met: (i) the goods have been identified separately as belonging to the customer; (ii) the goods are ready for physical shipment to the customer; (iii) the Company does not have the ability to direct the goods to another customer; and (iv) the arrangement was requested by the customer and that the customer has sufficiently explained a substantial business purpose for the arrangement. Management also considers whether the customer's custodial risks are insured and whether modifications to the Company's normal billing and credit terms were required.\nRevenues on certain fixed-price contracts where we provide engineering services, prototypes and completed products are recognized over the contract term based upon percentage of completion or based upon milestones delivered that are provided during the period and compared to milestone goals to be provided over the entire contract. These services require that we perform significant, extensive and complex design, development, modification or implementation of our customers' systems. Performance will often extend over long periods of time, and our right to receive future payment depends on our future performance in accordance with the agreement.\nThe percentage-of-completion methodology involves recognizing probable and reasonably estimable revenue using the percentage of services completed, on a current cumulative cost to estimated total cost basis, using a reasonably consistent profit margin over the period. Due to the long-term nature of these projects, developing the estimates of costs often requires significant judgment. Factors that must be considered in estimating the progress of work completed and ultimate cost of the projects include, but are not limited to, the availability of labor and labor productivity, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and the impact of delayed performance. If changes occur in delivery, productivity or other factors used in developing the estimates of costs or revenues, we revise our cost and revenue estimates, which may result in increases or decreases in revenues and costs, and such revisions are reflected in earnings in the period in which the revision becomes known.\nOn certain contracts with several of the Company's significant customers, the Company receives payments in advance of manufacturing. Advanced payments are recorded as deferred revenue until the revenue recognition criteria described above has been met.\nRelated billings that are in excess of revenue earned are deferred and recorded as a liability on the balance sheet until the related services are provided. The Company recognizes revenues for non-refundable, upfront implementation fees on a straight-line basis over the period beginning with initiation of ongoing services through the end of the contract term.\nCost of revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of costs of materials, costs paid to third-party contract manufacturers (which may include the costs of components), and personnel costs associated with manufacturing and support operations. Personnel costs consist of wages, bonuses, benefits, stock-based compensation expenses. Cost of revenue also includes freight, allocated overhead costs and inventory write-offs and changes to our inventory and warranty reserves. Allocated overhead costs consist of certain facilities and utility costs. We expect cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars with an improvement in margin, as product revenue increases.\nOperating expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of general and administrative, sales and marketing and research and development expenses. Salaries and personnel-related costs, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense, are the most significant components of each category of operating expenses. Operating expenses also include allocated overhead costs for facilities and utility costs.\nGeneral and Administrative - General and administrative expense consists primarily of employee compensation and related expenses for administrative functions including finance, legal, human resources and fees for third-party professional services, as well as allocated overhead. For 2018, general and administrative expenses include the costs related to the dissolution of SkyScale, LLC. We expect our general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in growing the business.\nSales and Marketing - Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of employee compensation and related expenses, sales commissions, marketing programs, travel and entertainment expenses as well as allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, tradeshows, events, corporate communications and brand-building activities. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our sales force, increase marketing resources, and further develop sales channels.\nResearch and Development - Research and development expense consists primarily of employee compensation and related expenses, prototype expenses, depreciation associated with assets acquired for research and development, third-party engineering and contractor support costs, as well as allocated overhead. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in new and existing products.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income consists of income received for activities outside of our core business. This includes interest income from investments and finance charges from customers. Other expense includes expenses for activities outside of our core business. These expenses consist primarily of loan amortization and interest expense.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists of estimated income taxes due to the United States and German governments as well as state tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we conduct business, along with the change in our deferred income tax assets and liabilities.\nResults of Operations\nResults of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 include Magma, SkyScale (through December 31, 2018 dissolution date), the Ion business from Western Digital on July 1, 2017, Concept Development Inc., which was acquired on August 31, 2018, and Bressner Technology GmbH, which was acquired on October 31, 2018.\nAccordingly, the periods presented below are not directly comparable. After the completion of four quarters, these businesses for both revenue and expense reporting will be treated as organic operating activity for current and comparable historical periods. The following tables set forth our results of continued operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 respectively, presented in dollars and as percentage of net revenue.\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 respectively, presented in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue.\n\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe believe that the use of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or adjusted EBITDA, is helpful for an investor to assess the performance of the Company. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, acquisition expense, impairment of long-lived assets, financing costs, fair value adjustments from purchase accounting, stock-based compensation expense and expenses related to discontinued operations.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of equity instruments that can impact a company's non-cash operating expenses, we believe that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-cash and non-recurring expenses allows for meaningful comparisons between our core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing us with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating our own core business operating results over different periods of time.\nOur adjusted EBITDA measure may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies in our industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring and unusual items. Our adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or as an indication of operating performance or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. We do not consider adjusted EBITDA to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results.\n\n (1) Expenses incurred in the acquisition of CDI and Bressner. \nAdjusted EPS\nAdjusted EPS excludes the impact of certain items and, therefore, has not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that exclusion of certain selected items assists in providing a more complete understanding of our underlying results and trends and allows for comparability with our peer company index and industry. We use this measure along with the corresponding GAAP financial measures to manage our business and to evaluate our performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace. The Company defines non-GAAP (loss) income attributable to common stockholders as (loss) or income before amortization, stock-based compensation, expenses related to discontinued operations, and acquisition costs. Adjusted EPS expresses adjusted (loss) income on a per share basis using weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\nAdjusted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. We expect to continue to incur expenses similar to the adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted EPS financial adjustments described above, and investors should not infer from our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures that these costs are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring.\nThe following table reconciles net loss attributable to common stockholders and diluted earnings per share:\n\nFree cash flow, a non-GAAP measure for reporting cash flow, is defined as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures for property and equipment, which includes capitalized software development costs. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on cash available for investments and acquisitions after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long-term value creation. We believe that trends in our free cash flow can be valuable indicators of our operating performance and liquidity.\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nWe expect to continue to incur expenditures similar to the free cash flow adjustments described above, and investors should not infer from our presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure that these expenditures reflect all of our obligations which require cash. The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow:\n\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\n\nRevenue\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, total revenue increased $21,280,637 or 57.5%, as compared to the same period in 2018. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by revenue from acquisitions which provided $16,278,668 of which Bressner contributed $14,496,593 or 39.2 percentage points and CDI contributed $1,782,075 or 4.8 percentage points of the total increase in revenue. OSS saw an increase in revenue of $5,160,483 or 13.9 percentage points as compared to same period in the prior year. The majority of this increase is attributable to shipments associated with our flash arrays on our airborne military flash contract as well as improvements in our sales of media and entertainment products. There was also a small decrease of $(158,514) or a decrease of (0.4) percentage points attributable to SkyScale which has been dissolved.\nCost of revenue and gross profit\nCost of revenue increased by $13,213,097 or 51.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily driven by cost of revenue from acquisitions which contributed $12,562,168 of which Bressner contributed $11,346,707 or 44.2 percentage points and CDI contributed $1,215,461or 4.7 percentage points of the total increase in cost of revenue. OSS saw an increase in cost of revenue of $1,325,988 or 5.2 percentage points as compared to same period in the prior year. This change is attributable to a reduction of $957,693 in applied labor and overhead into inventory from the previous year, offset by costs of goods associated with increased sales of our flash array systems and media and entertainment products in the current year. There was also a decrease of $(675,059) or a decrease of (2.6) percentage points attributable to SkyScale which has been dissolved.\nThe overall gross margin percentage increase from 30.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 33.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of 2.7 percentage points. OSS gross margin percentage for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 39.2%, which was 5.6 percentage points more in comparison to the prior year period of 33.6%. The 5.6 percentage point increase is attributable to change in mix attributable to higher sales of our flash array systems. CDI contributed gross margin at a rate of 22.6% due to cost engineering projects on fixed price contracts, while Bressner contributed gross margin at a rate of 22.5%.\nOperating expenses\nGeneral and administrative expense\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $1,988,274 or 30.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to same period in 2018. OSS experienced a reduction of $(379,882) or (19.0%) of the total annual increase in these expenses. The decrease in general and administrative expense for OSS was primarily attributable to not incurring acquisition costs in the current year which was a saving of approximately $628,000 as compared to the prior year, costs associated with the winding down of SkyScale in the prior year which resulted in a savings of approximately $778,000 and a reduction in amortization expense. These savings were offset by some degree by additional compensation costs and third party service costs associated with being a public company which includes legal, accounting costs, insurance, listing fees and reporting and compliance costs and employee costs. CDI contributed $871,422 or 43.8% which is attributable to a full year of operations as compared to only four months of activity in 2018, as a result of being acquired on August 31, 2018. Bressner contributed $1,855,458 or 93.3% of the total annual increase, which is attributable to a full year of operations as compared to only two months of activity in 2018, as a result of being acquired on October 31, 2018. There was also a decrease of $(358,724) or (18.1%) attributable to SkyScale which has been dissolved. Overall general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue to 14.6% during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 17.6% during the same period in 2018.\nImpairment of goodwill\nDuring the current year, the Company took a write-down of $1,697,394 attributable to impairment of goodwill of CDI due to a short-fall in the actual overall financial performance of CDI as compared to plan, a recurring need for working capital, and a decrease in the overall Company's stock price. There was no such impairment charge in 2018.\nMarketing and selling expense\nMarketing and selling expense increased $1,143,234 or 28.6% during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018. OSS had an increase of $172,128 or 15.1% of the total increase. There was also a reduction in marketing and selling expense of $(132,004) or (11.6%) as a result of the dissolution of SkyScale. CDI's marketing expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $195,295 or 17.1%, which represented twelve months of activity as compared to the prior year which included only four months of activity. Bressner contributed $907,815 or 79.4% which represented twelve months of activity as compared to the prior year which included only two months of activity. Overall, total marketing and selling expense decreased as a percentage of revenue to 8.8% during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 10.8% during the same period in 2018.\nResearch and development expense\nResearch and development expense increased by $841,799 or 21% during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to same period in 2018. OSS saw an increase of $291,643 or 34.7%. The increase was largely driven by increased employee compensation costs. CDI contributed $240,154 or 28.5% of the annual increase while Bressner contributed $310,002 or 36.8% of the annual increase for 2019. Overall, total research and development expense decreased as a percentage of revenue to 8.3% during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 10.8% during the same period in 2018.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense increased $99,867 or 152% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018. The Company borrowed $1,500,000 from individuals and related parties at an annual interest rate of 9.5%, additionally, warrants of 10% of the value of the borrowing were also granted. The fair value of the warrants is amortized over the life of the loans and such costs are included as interest expense. On October 31, 2018, the Company acquired Bressner which has a line of credit and certain term loans outstanding and as a result, incurred interest charges of $39,292 during the year. The outstanding debt associated with OSS in 2018 was paid down in its entirety with proceeds from its public offering in February 2018.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), for the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted in income of $281,494 as compared to $271,877 in the same period in 2018. The majority of the income for the current year is attributable to interest earned by OSS of $151,113 on deposits, and interest on outstanding customer invoices that were on extended terms. Additionally, the Company recognized a benefit of $208,332 from estimated expenses that had been accrued in the dissolution process of SkyScale which were not realized. This other income was offset during the period by foreign currency transactions losses.\nProvision for income taxes / Income tax benefits\nWe have recorded an income tax benefit of $54,055, for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to tax benefits of $1,396,784, for the same period in 2018. The provision for the current period is attributable to annual taxable income for 2019 of $1,772,975 with a projected tax rate of 13.4%. The projected effective tax rate for the year differs from the statutory rate mainly due to permanent non-deductible goodwill amortization for Bressner Technology GmbH, income from the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income inclusion, as well as projecting federal, foreign and state tax liabilities for the year.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nGiven our recent operating losses, the Company's primary sources of liquidity have been provided by (i) the Company's February 2018 initial public offering (net proceeds were approximately $16,100,000), (ii) March 2019 notes payable from members of the Board of Directors and others of $1,500,000, and (iii) the June 2019 sale of 1,554,832 shares of the Company's common stock for net cash proceeds of $2,488,148.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company's cash and cash equivalents were approximately $5,200,000 and working capital approximated $14,000,000. Cash and cash equivalents held by Bressner totaled $745,000 (USD) at December 31, 2019, and Bressner's debt covenants do not permit the use of those funds by its parent company. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company experienced an operating loss of $779,000, but cash flows provided by operating activities approximated $2,400,000.\nThe Company's revenue growth, inclusive of two acquisitions made in 2018, has resulted in growth of the Company as a whole, but has been offset by increased spending in all areas of operating expenses: general and administrative, marketing and selling, and research and development. Further, in late 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was first detected in Wuhan, China. Following the outbreak of this virus, governments throughout the world, including in the United States of America, have quarantined certain affected regions, restricted travel and imposed significant limitations on other economic activities. The Company's operations team is closely monitoring the potential impact to the Company's business, including its cash flows, supply chains, customers and employees. Though management has successfully managed through the current known impacts, if the situation further deteriorates or the outbreak results in further restriction on both supply and demand factors, our cash flows, financial position and operating results for fiscal year 2020 and beyond will be negatively impacted. Neither the length of time nor the magnitude of the negative impacts can be presently determined.\nManagement's plans with respect to the above is to continue its efforts to restructure the Company with the primary objectives of reducing costs, conserving cash, strengthening margins, and improving company-wide execution. Specific actions already implemented by management include the deferral of certain executive and Board compensation payments, a freeze on hiring and minimizing overtime, travel and entertainment, and contractor costs. In addition, management continues to review its expenses on a line item-by-line item basis for cost reduction opportunities, as well as opportunities to increase efficiencies through automation.\nWhile management expects these actions to result in prospective cost reductions, management is also committed to securing debt and/or equity financing to ensure that liquidity will be sufficient to meet the Company's cash requirements through at least a period of the next twelve months. Management believes potential sources of liquidity include at least the following:\n \u25aa In March 2019, the Company received funding commitments in the amount of $4,000,000 from members of the Board of Directors, of which $1,500,000 has been drawn through December 31, 2019. As of March 26, 2020, management expects that $750,000 of such commitments are currently available to the Company. \n \u25aa In March 2020, the Company signed a term sheet with Ayrton Capital LLC for a $5.0 million non-interest bearing convertible note with a 10% original issue discount. The first tranche of $3.0 million is available upon closing with $2.0 million available seven months from the date of closing at the option of the Company. The note is repayable in twenty-two installments beginning three months after closing. While this transaction has not been completed as of March 26, 2020, management expects that the transaction will close prior to April 15, 2020. \n \u25aa In May 2019, the Company filed a Form S-3 prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission which became effective on June 19, 2019, and allows the Company to offer up to $100,000,000 aggregate dollar amount of shares of its common stock or other financial instruments. \nAs a result of management's cost reduction plans, the Company's potential sources of liquidity and management's most recent cash flow forecasts, management believes that the Company has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. However, there can be no assurance that management's cost reduction efforts will be effective, the forecasted cash flows will be achieved, or that external sources of financing,\nincluding the issuance of debt and/or equity securities, will be available at times and on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\n\nOperating Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated $2,374,868 in cash from operating activities, an increase in cash of $6,265,654 when compared to the cash used in operating activities of $3,890,786 during the same period in 2018. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily a result of a reduction in working capital requirements of $2,392,755, a reduction in net loss of $235,941, and an increase in non-cash adjustments of $3,636,958. Non-cash adjustments include increases of $4,049,059 comprised of the loss attributable to noncontrolling interest, deferred benefit for income taxes, loss on foreign currency transactions, provision for bad debt, impairment of goodwill, amortization of deferred gain, depreciation and amortization, inventory reserves, stock-based compensation expense an unrealized loss on forward currency contracts. These increases were offset by $(412,101) in decreases in non-cash adjustments attributable to, gain on disposal of property and equipment, provision, warranty reserves, and amortization of debt discount.\nWorking capital requirements decreased overall by $2,392,755. The sources of working capital of $3,770,079 were attributable to reductions in accounts receivable and prepaids and other assets, and increases in accounts payable for the comparable period. These sources were offset by uses of working capital due to increased inventory levels and reduced accrued expenses and other liabilities of $1,377,324.\nOur ability to generate cash from operations in future periods will depend in large part on our profitability, the rate and timing of collections of our accounts receivable, our inventory turns and our ability to manage other areas of working capital including accounts payable.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we used cash of $2,385,177 in investing activities as compared to $5,909,192 used during the same period in 2018, a decrease of $1,850,567. The expenditures in the current year are primarily due to tenant improvements to our headquarter facility and software costs and external consulting costs associated with the implementation of our ERP system for which phase one of the project was substantially completed in 2019. We currently do not anticipate any other significant purchases of equipment nor expansion of our ERP system beyond completion of phase II of the project, which is the integration of certain sales functions.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated $2,922,101 from financing activities as compared to the cash generated of $11,900,178 during the same period in 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we raised $1,500,000 from individuals and related parties through the issuance of notes payable that bear interest at an annual rate of 9.5% and are repaid through 24 months monthly installments. Additionally, during the third quarter of the year, the Company sold 1,554,832 shares of common stock for total gross proceeds of $2,700,714, which after commissions to brokers and other expenses resulted in net proceeds to us of $2,488,148. The Company also received proceeds of $47,334 from the exercise of warrants and stock options.\nBressner increased borrowing under its lines of credit for the purchase of inventories and also borrowed funds through term loans at interest rates of 2.125% - 2.250% that are repaid through monthly installments of up to 24 months.\nDuring year ended December 31, 2018, the Company received proceeds from the sale of common stock in our initial public offering of $19,500,000 which was offset by our stock issuance costs for commissions and third party professional services. We also received $113,168 from the exercise of warrants and stock options. With the proceeds from our initial public offering, we paid off our line of credit and retired all outstanding debt obligations.\nContractual obligations and commitments\nThe following table sets forth our non-cancellable contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019.\n\nWe have made certain indemnities, under which the Company may be required to make payments to an indemnified party, in relation to certain transactions. We indemnify our directors, officers, employees and agents to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of the State of Delaware. In connection with our facilities leases, we indemnify our lessors for certain claims arising from the use of our facilities. The duration of the indemnities varies, and in many cases is indefinite. These indemnities do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential future payments we could be obligated to make. Historically, we have not been obligated to make any payments for these obligations and no liabilities have been recorded for these indemnities.\nOff balance sheet arrangements\nOther than lease commitments incurred in the normal course of business and certain indemnification provisions, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities, guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in transferred assets, or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity.\nWe do not have any majority-owned subsidiaries that are not consolidated in the financial statements. Additionally, we do not have an interest in, or relationships with, any special purpose entities.\nStockholder transactions\nEffective August 1, 2016, we entered into a management services agreement with a company owned by the former Chief Executive Officer of Magma. The agreement called for payments of $180,000 per year for the first two years paid in monthly installments. In year three, the amount was reduced to $37,500 for the year paid in monthly installments. Additionally, we granted 30,000 options in conjunction with execution of this agreement. Payments for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $21,875 and $120,635, respectively. Such management services agreement has been now fully completed.\nIn April 2019, certain members of the Company's Board of Directors executed definitive agreements to commit funds of up to $4,000,000 as a credit facility. The Company initially borrowed $1,150,000 from members of the Board of Directors and $350,000 from other shareholders for a two year period at an interest rate of 9.5% which requires the Company to make monthly principal and interest payment of $69,000 per month. In connection with these loans, the Company issued the note holders warrants to purchase shares of the Company's common stock equal to 10% of the original principal as a price per share equal to $2.15 per share. Accordingly, the Company issued to the note holders warrants to purchase 69,766 shares of the Company's common stock. The relative fair value of the warrants issued was $60,158.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we\nbelieve to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates. The critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nOn January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the new accounting standard update ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which superseded nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP, to all contracts using the modified retrospective method. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.\nThe Company's performance obligations are satisfied over time as work is performed or at a point in time. The majority of the Company's revenue is recognized at a point in time when products ship and control is transferred to the customer. The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied.\nThe Company's contracts are executed through a combination of written agreements along with purchase orders with all customers including certain general terms and conditions. Generally, purchase orders entail products, quantities and prices, which define the performance obligations of each party and are approved and accepted by the Company. The Company's contracts with customers do not include extended payment terms. Payment terms vary by contract type and type of customer and generally range from 30 to 60 days from invoice. Additionally, taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer and deposited with the relevant government authority, are excluded from revenue.\nThe transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer adjusted for estimated variable consideration, if any. Variable consideration may include discounts, rights of return, refunds, and other similar obligations. The Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct product and service based on its relative standalone selling price. The standalone selling price for products primarily involves the cost to produce the deliverable plus the anticipated margin and for services is estimated based on the Company's approved list price.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company does not accept product returns unless the items are defective as manufactured. The Company establishes provisions for estimated returns and warranties. In addition, the Company does not typically provide customers with the right to a refund and does not transact for noncash consideration.\nCustomer agreements include one vendor managed inventory program. The Company recognizes revenue under this arrangement when all of the following criteria are met: (i) the goods have been identified separately as belonging to the customer; (ii) the goods are ready for physical shipment to the customer; (iii) the Company does not have the ability to direct the goods to another customer; and (iv) the arrangement was requested by the customer and that the customer has sufficiently explained a substantial business purpose for the arrangement. Management also considers whether the customer's custodial risks are insured and whether modifications to the Company's normal billing and credit terms were required.\nRevenues on certain fixed-price contracts where we provide engineering services, prototypes and completed products are recognized based upon percentage of completion or based upon milestones delivered that are provided during the period and compared to milestone goals to be provided over the entire contract. These services require that we perform significant, extensive and complex design, development, modification or implementation of our customers' systems. Performance will often extend over long periods of time, and our right to receive future payment depends on our future performance in accordance with the agreement.\nThe percentage-of-completion methodology involves recognizing probable and reasonably estimable revenue using the percentage of services completed, on a current cumulative cost to estimated total cost basis, using a reasonably consistent profit margin over the performance period. Due to the long-term nature of these projects, developing the estimates of costs often requires significant judgment. Factors that must be considered in estimating the progress of work completed and ultimate cost of the projects include, but are not limited to, the availability of labor and labor productivity, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and the impact of delayed performance. If changes occur in delivery, productivity or other factors used in developing the estimates of costs or revenues, we revise our cost and revenue estimates, which may result in increases or decreases in revenues and costs, and such revisions are reflected in earnings in the period in which the revision becomes known.\nOn certain contracts with several of the Company's significant customers, the Company receives payments in advance of manufacturing. Advanced payments are recorded as deferred revenue until the revenue recognition criteria described above has been met.\nRelated billings that are in excess of revenue earned are deferred and recorded as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet until the related services are provided. Deferred revenue was $24,718 and $133,995 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company recognizes revenues for non-refundable, upfront implementation fees on a straight-line basis over the period beginning with initiation of ongoing services through the end of the contract term.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards granted to our employees and other service providers, including stock options granted under the 2017 Plan and 2015 Stock Option Plan that was approved in December 2015 (the 2015 Plan\u201d), based on the estimated fair value of the award. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards granted under the 2017 Plan and 2015 Plan. We recognize the fair value of stock options granted under the 2017 Plan and 2015 Plan as stock-based compensation on a straight line basis over the requisite service period. We record expense net of anticipated forfeitures and adjust the annual expense based upon actual experience.\nCompensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related service period. The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period.\nOur use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the fair value of the underlying common stock, expected term of the option, expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. The assumptions used in our option pricing model represent management's best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nThese assumptions and estimates are as follows:\n \u2022 Fair Value of Common Stock. Since the completion of our IPO, we use the closing quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant. \n \u2022 Expected Term. The expected term represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. The expected term assumptions were determined based on the vesting terms and contractual lives of the options, using the simplified method. \n \u2022 Expected Volatility. Since we do not have sufficient trading history of our common stock, the expected volatility was determined based on the historical stock volatilities of comparable companies. Comparable companies consist of public companies in our industry that is similar in size, stage of life cycle and financial leverage. We intend to continue to apply this process using the same or similar public companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own share price becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the identified companies are no longer similar to us, in which case, more suitable companies whose share prices are publicly available would be used in the calculation. \n \u2022 Risk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options. \n \u2022 Dividend Rate. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future, and, therefore, use an expected dividend yield of zero. \nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and operating results together with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based upon current beliefs, plans and expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors\u201d or in other parts of this Annual Report.\nOverview\nOSS designs, manufactures and markets custom high-speed computing systems for high-performance edge computing (HPC) applications.

( Magma\u201d). Magma designs, manufactures, and markets industrial grade computer systems and components and operates out of our main facility in Escondido, California.\nOn April 6, 2017, we formed SkyScale, LLC ( SkyScale\u201d), a High-Performance Computing as a Service (HPCaaS) provider to offer customers world-class, ultra-fast, multi-GPU hardware platforms in the cloud. SkyScale was jointly owned with Jacoma Investments, LLC, an entity controlled by our board member Jack Harrison. In accordance with the terms of the operating agreement, Jacoma Investments, LLC agreed to contribute $750,000 in capital and we agreed to contribute $750,000 in the form of credits to purchase equipment, personnel or support services. Each of us received a 50% membership interest. On December 31, 2018, as a result of changes in the competitive landscape and downward pressure on pricing from large competitors, the members to the joint venture agreement agreed to begin the dissolution of SkyScale.\nOn May 9, 2017, we entered into an agreement to acquire the source code license to the Ion flash array software from Western Digital. We plan to continue to develop and sell Ion software with our high-density storage arrays, as well as servicing existing Western Digital software users. OSS Ion software works with our all-flash storage systems, and provides them with a critical point of differentiation with respect to speed and throughput. The OSS Ion software leverages flash storage and open server hardware to accelerate applications and SAN performance through sharing or clustering high-speed all-flash storage arrays. The software supports many major OEM servers and provides an intuitive interface for system users to manage its many features. Having the Ion software source code and engineering team on-board allows us to strategically grow our all-flash storage business in the many Big Data\u201d and HPC markets going forward.\nOn July 1, 2017, we entered in to a Service Agreement with Western Digital to service their existing customer base that utilizes Ion flash storage software. Additionally, we purchased certain equipment from Western Digital and hired selected employees to assist in the servicing of these existing customers.\nOn December 18, 2017, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 with the SEC related to a firm commitment underwritten initial public offering of the Company's common stock, par value $0.0001 per share. The initial public offering was declared effective by the SEC on January 31, 2018. The Company commenced trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol OSS\u201d on February 1, 2018. On February 5, 2018, the Company closed the initial public offering selling an aggregate of 3,800,000 shares of common stock at a price to the public of $5.00 for total gross proceeds to the Company of $19,000,000, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $1,330,000 and underwriter offering-related transaction costs of $185,000, the Company received net proceeds of $17,485,000.\nOn February 1, 2018, the Company issued warrants to purchase 380,000 shares of common stock at a price of $6.00 to Roth Capital Partners LLC.\nSubsequent to completion of the Company's initial public offering in February 2018, the Company used proceeds to pay down the outstanding standing balance of our line of credit of $2,758,517 and other debt obligations $1,096,343.\nOn February 9, 2018, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option to purchase an additional 200,000 shares of common stock at the public offering price of $5.00 per share of which 100,000 newly issued shares of common stock were purchased directly from the Company and 100,000 shares were sold by our former CEO's family trust as selling stockholder. The Company received gross proceeds of $500,000, which resulted in net proceeds of $465,000 to the Company, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $35,000.\nOn August 31, 2018, the Company acquired Concept Development Inc. (CDI) located in Irvine, California for cash of $646,759, and common stock of $4,194,673 (Note 3). CDI specializes in the design and manufacture of custom high-performance computing systems for airborne in-flight entertainment systems.\nOn October 31, 2018, the Company's wholly-owned German subsidiary, OSS GmbH, acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Bressner Technology GmbH, a Germany limited liability company located near Munich, Germany, from its principal owners for cash consideration of \u20ac4,725,000 (US$5,374,582) and stock consideration of 106,463 newly-issued restricted shares of the Company's common stock.\nIn April 2019, certain members of the Company's Board of Directors executed definitive agreements to commit funds of up to $4,000,000 as a credit facility. The Company initially borrowed $1,150,000 from members of the Board of Directors and $350,000 from other shareholders for a two year period at an interest rate of 9.5% which requires the Company to make monthly principal and interest payment of $69,000 per month. In connection with these loans, the Company issued the note holders warrants to purchase shares of the Company's common stock equal to 10% of the original principal as a price per share equal to $2.15 per share. Accordingly, the Company issued to the note holders warrants to purchase 69,766 share of the Company's common stock. The relative fair value of the warrants issued was $60,158.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company sold 1,554,832 shares of common stock through this offering for total gross proceeds of $2,700,714, which resulted in net proceeds to the company of $2,488,148, after deducting compensation payable to Noble of $55,127 and other expenses of $157,439. The Equity Distribution Agreement was terminated on August 26, 2019.\nIn December 2019, a strain of coronavirus surfaced in China. As a result, there have been numerous factory closures. While many factories were closed for a few days because of the Chinese New Year holiday, the Chinese government ordered that businesses in various areas extend the Chinese New Year holiday due to the coronavirus outbreak and it is possible that the Chinese government will announce new closures in the future. Some of our suppliers in China as well as other locations throughout the world have similarly been affected and experienced closures and risks of labor shortages. If our suppliers experience additional closures in the future, we may have difficulty sourcing materials necessary to fulfill production requirements and meet scheduled shipments, which will negatively affect our revenues. Even if we are able to find alternate sources for such materials, they may cost more, which will affect our profitability. If our suppliers in China and other Asian markets experience additional closures in the future and are not able to accept orders or if they delay or cancel such orders, our revenues will be negatively affected. At this point in time, there is significant uncertainty relating to the potential effect of the coronavirus on our business. Infections may become more widespread and there might be additional factory closures in the future, all of which will have a negative impact on our\nbusiness, financial condition and operating results. Additionally, as a result of significant changes in the worldwide capital markets and general business climate, the impact on the future demand for our products is unknown at this time.\nOn February 15, 2020, Steve Cooper was terminated as President and CEO of One Stop Systems, Inc., and was replaced by David Raun who has become interim CEO of the Company.\nOur Business Model\nOSS designs, manufactures and sells specialized high-performance edge computing (HPC) systems to customers world-wide. We differentiate ourselves from other suppliers of HPC solutions by utilizing our high-performance expertise in custom systems design and PCIe expansion to build systems with a greater quantity of PCIe add-in slots, GPU-based compute cards and/or flash cards. Our systems offer industry leading capabilities that occupy less physical space and power consumption.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nOn January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the new accounting standard update ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which superseded nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP, to all contracts using the modified retrospective method. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.\nThe Company's performance obligations are satisfied over time as work is performed or at a point in time.

The Company recognizes revenues for non-refundable, upfront implementation fees on a straight-line basis over the period beginning with initiation of ongoing services through the end of the contract term.\nCost of revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of costs of materials, costs paid to third-party contract manufacturers (which may include the costs of components), and personnel costs associated with manufacturing and support operations. Personnel costs consist of wages, bonuses, benefits, stock-based compensation expenses. Cost of revenue also includes freight, allocated overhead costs and inventory write-offs and changes to our inventory and warranty reserves. Allocated overhead costs consist of certain facilities and utility costs. We expect cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars with an improvement in margin, as product revenue increases.\nOperating expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of general and administrative, sales and marketing and research and development expenses. Salaries and personnel-related costs, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense, are the most significant components of each category of operating expenses. Operating expenses also include allocated overhead costs for facilities and utility costs.\nGeneral and Administrative - General and administrative expense consists primarily of employee compensation and related expenses for administrative functions including finance, legal, human resources and fees for third-party professional services, as well as allocated overhead. For 2018, general and administrative expenses include the costs related to the dissolution of SkyScale, LLC. We expect our general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in growing the business.\nSales and Marketing - Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of employee compensation and related expenses, sales commissions, marketing programs, travel and entertainment expenses as well as allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, tradeshows, events, corporate communications and brand-building activities. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our sales force, increase marketing resources, and further develop sales channels.\nResearch and Development - Research and development expense consists primarily of employee compensation and related expenses, prototype expenses, depreciation associated with assets acquired for research and development, third-party engineering and contractor support costs, as well as allocated overhead. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in new and existing products.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income consists of income received for activities outside of our core business. This includes interest income from investments and finance charges from customers. Other expense includes expenses for activities outside of our core business. These expenses consist primarily of loan amortization and interest expense.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists of estimated income taxes due to the United States and German governments as well as state tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we conduct business, along with the change in our deferred income tax assets and liabilities.\nResults of Operations\nResults of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 include Magma, SkyScale (through December 31, 2018 dissolution date), the Ion business from Western Digital on July 1, 2017, Concept Development Inc., which was acquired on August 31, 2018, and Bressner Technology GmbH, which was acquired on October 31, 2018.\nAccordingly, the periods presented below are not directly comparable. After the completion of four quarters, these businesses for both revenue and expense reporting will be treated as organic operating activity for current and comparable historical periods. The following tables set forth our results of continued operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 respectively, presented in dollars and as percentage of net revenue.\nThe following

Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe believe that the use of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or adjusted EBITDA, is helpful for an investor to assess the performance of the Company. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, acquisition expense, impairment of long-lived assets, financing costs, fair value adjustments from purchase accounting, stock-based compensation expense and expenses related to discontinued operations.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of equity instruments that can impact a company's non-cash operating expenses, we believe that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-cash and non-recurring expenses allows for meaningful comparisons between our core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing us with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating our own core business operating results over different periods of time.\nOur adjusted EBITDA measure may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies in our industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring and unusual items. Our adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or as an indication of operating performance or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. We do not consider adjusted EBITDA to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results.\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (900,337\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,136,278\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,655,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,350,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of debt discount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of deferred gain\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (57,675\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (134,640\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of goodwill\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,697,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 649,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 527,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 165,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 65,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (151,113\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (85,710\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost resulting from dissolution of SkyScale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (146,150\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 705,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition expenses (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 664,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Benefit for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 237,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,396,784\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,175,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 584,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Expenses incurred in the acquisition of CDI and Bressner. \nAdjusted EPS\nAdjusted EPS excludes the impact of certain items and, therefore, has not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that exclusion of certain selected items assists in providing a more complete understanding of our underlying results and trends and allows for comparability with our peer company index and industry. We use this measure along with the corresponding GAAP financial measures to manage our business and to evaluate our performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace. The Company defines non-GAAP (loss) income attributable to common stockholders as (loss) or income before amortization, stock-based compensation, expenses related to discontinued operations, and acquisition costs. Adjusted EPS expresses adjusted (loss) income on a per share basis using weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\nAdjusted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. We expect to continue to incur expenses similar to the adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted EPS financial adjustments described above, and investors should not infer from our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures that these costs are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring.\nThe following table reconciles net loss attributable to common stockholders and diluted earnings per share:\nTable 156: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (900,337\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,136,278\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of intangibles\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 984,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 630,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of goodwill\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,697,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 649,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 527,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost resulting from dissolution of SkyScale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (146,150\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 705,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 664,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,288,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,391,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-GAAP net income per share attributable to common stockholders:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average common shares outstanding:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,148,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,586,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,158,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,741,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFree cash flow, a non-GAAP measure for reporting cash flow, is defined as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures for property and equipment, which includes capitalized software development costs.

The increase in revenue was primarily driven by revenue from acquisitions which provided $16,278,668 of which Bressner contributed $14,496,593 or 39.2 percentage points and CDI contributed $1,782,075 or 4.8 percentage points of the total increase in revenue. OSS saw an increase in revenue of $5,160,483 or 13.9 percentage points as compared to same period in the prior year. The majority of this increase is attributable to shipments associated with our flash arrays on our airborne military flash contract as well as improvements in our sales of media and entertainment products. There was also a small decrease of $(158,514) or a decrease of (0.4) percentage points attributable to SkyScale which has been dissolved.\nCost of revenue and gross profit\nCost of revenue increased by $13,213,097 or 51.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily driven by cost of revenue from acquisitions which contributed $12,562,168 of which Bressner contributed $11,346,707 or 44.2 percentage points and CDI contributed $1,215,461or 4.7 percentage points of the total increase in cost of revenue. OSS saw an increase in cost of revenue of $1,325,988 or 5.2 percentage points as compared to same period in the prior year. This change is attributable to a reduction of $957,693 in applied labor and overhead into inventory from the previous year, offset by costs of goods associated with increased sales of our flash array systems and media and entertainment products in the current year. There was also a decrease of $(675,059) or a decrease of (2.6) percentage points attributable to SkyScale which has been dissolved.\nThe overall gross margin percentage increase from 30.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 33.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of 2.7 percentage points. OSS gross margin percentage for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 39.2%, which was 5.6 percentage points more in comparison to the prior year period of 33.6%. The 5.6 percentage point increase is attributable to change in mix attributable to higher sales of our flash array systems. CDI contributed gross margin at a rate of 22.6% due to cost engineering projects on fixed price contracts, while Bressner contributed gross margin at a rate of 22.5%.\nOperating expenses\nGeneral and administrative expense\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $1,988,274 or 30.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to same period in 2018. OSS experienced a reduction of $(379,882) or (19.0%) of the total annual increase in these expenses. The decrease in general and administrative expense for OSS was primarily attributable to not incurring acquisition costs in the current year which was a saving of approximately $628,000 as compared to the prior year, costs associated with the winding down of SkyScale in the prior year which resulted in a savings of approximately $778,000 and a reduction in amortization expense. These savings were offset by some degree by additional compensation costs and third party service costs associated with being a public company which includes legal, accounting costs, insurance, listing fees and reporting and compliance costs and employee costs. CDI contributed $871,422 or 43.8% which is attributable to a full year of operations as compared to only four months of activity in 2018, as a result of being acquired on August 31, 2018. Bressner contributed $1,855,458 or 93.3% of the total annual increase, which is attributable to a full year of operations as compared to only two months of activity in 2018, as a result of being acquired on October 31, 2018. There was also a decrease of $(358,724) or (18.1%) attributable to SkyScale which has been dissolved. Overall general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue to 14.6% during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 17.6% during the same period in 2018.\nImpairment of goodwill\nDuring the current year, the Company took a write-down of $1,697,394 attributable to impairment of goodwill of CDI due to a short-fall in the actual overall financial performance of CDI as compared to plan, a recurring need for working capital, and a decrease in the overall Company's stock price. There was no such impairment charge in 2018.\nMarketing and selling expense\nMarketing and selling expense increased $1,143,234 or 28.6% during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018. OSS had an increase of $172,128 or 15.1% of the total increase. There was also a reduction in marketing and selling expense of $(132,004) or (11.6%) as a result of the dissolution of SkyScale. CDI's marketing expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $195,295 or 17.1%, which represented twelve months of activity as compared to the prior year which included only four months of activity. Bressner contributed $907,815 or 79.4% which represented twelve months of activity as compared to the prior year which included only two months of activity. Overall, total marketing and selling expense decreased as a percentage of revenue to 8.8% during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 10.8% during the same period in 2018.\nResearch and development expense\nResearch and development expense increased by $841,799 or 21% during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to same period in 2018. OSS saw an increase of $291,643 or 34.7%. The increase was largely driven by increased employee compensation costs. CDI contributed $240,154 or 28.5% of the annual increase while Bressner contributed $310,002 or 36.8% of the annual increase for 2019. Overall, total research and development expense decreased as a percentage of revenue to 8.3% during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 10.8% during the same period in 2018.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense increased $99,867 or 152% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018. The Company borrowed $1,500,000 from individuals and related parties at an annual interest rate of 9.5%, additionally, warrants of 10% of the value of the borrowing were also granted. The fair value of the warrants is amortized over the life of the loans and such costs are included as interest expense. On October 31, 2018, the Company acquired Bressner which has a line of credit and certain term loans outstanding and as a result, incurred interest charges of $39,292 during the year. The outstanding debt associated with OSS in 2018 was paid down in its entirety with proceeds from its public offering in February 2018.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), for the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted in income of $281,494 as compared to $271,877 in the same period in 2018. The majority of the income for the current year is attributable to interest earned by OSS of $151,113 on deposits, and interest on outstanding customer invoices that were on extended terms. Additionally, the Company recognized a benefit of $208,332 from estimated expenses that had been accrued in the dissolution process of SkyScale which were not realized. This other income was offset during the period by foreign currency transactions losses.\nProvision for income taxes / Income tax benefits\nWe have recorded an income tax benefit of $54,055, for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to tax benefits of $1,396,784, for the same period in 2018. The provision for the current period is attributable to annual taxable income for 2019 of $1,772,975 with a projected tax rate of 13.4%. The projected effective tax rate for the year differs from the statutory rate mainly due to permanent non-deductible goodwill amortization for Bressner Technology GmbH, income from the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income inclusion, as well as projecting federal, foreign and state tax liabilities for the year.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nGiven our recent operating losses, the Company's primary sources of liquidity have been provided by (i) the Company's February 2018 initial public offering (net proceeds were approximately $16,100,000), (ii) March 2019 notes payable from members of the Board of Directors and others of $1,500,000, and (iii) the June 2019 sale of 1,554,832 shares of the Company's common stock for net cash proceeds of $2,488,148.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company's cash and cash equivalents were approximately $5,200,000 and working capital approximated $14,000,000. Cash and cash equivalents held by Bressner totaled $745,000 (USD) at December 31, 2019, and Bressner's debt covenants do not permit the use of those funds by its parent company. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company experienced an operating loss of $779,000, but cash flows provided by operating activities approximated $2,400,000.\nThe Company's revenue growth, inclusive of two acquisitions made in 2018, has resulted in growth of the Company as a whole, but has been offset by increased spending in all areas of operating expenses: general and administrative, marketing and selling, and research and development. Further, in late 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was first detected in Wuhan, China. Following the outbreak of this virus, governments throughout the world, including in the United States of America, have quarantined certain affected regions, restricted travel and imposed significant limitations on other economic activities. The Company's operations team is closely monitoring the potential impact to the Company's business, including its cash flows, supply chains, customers and employees. Though management has successfully managed through the current known impacts, if the situation further deteriorates or the outbreak results in further restriction on both supply and demand factors, our cash flows, financial position and operating results for fiscal year 2020 and beyond will be negatively impacted. Neither the length of time nor the magnitude of the negative impacts can be presently determined.\nManagement's plans with respect to the above is to continue its efforts to restructure the Company with the primary objectives of reducing costs, conserving cash, strengthening margins, and improving company-wide execution. Specific actions already implemented by management include the deferral of certain executive and Board compensation payments, a freeze on hiring and minimizing overtime, travel and entertainment, and contractor costs. In addition, management continues to review its expenses on a line item-by-line item basis for cost reduction opportunities, as well as opportunities to increase efficiencies through automation.\nWhile management expects these actions to result in prospective cost reductions, management is also committed to securing debt and/or equity financing to ensure that liquidity will be sufficient to meet the Company's cash requirements through at least a period of the next twelve months. Management believes potential sources of liquidity include at least the following:\n \u25aa In March 2019, the Company received funding commitments in the amount of $4,000,000 from members of the Board of Directors, of which $1,500,000 has been drawn through December 31, 2019. As of March 26, 2020, management expects that $750,000 of such commitments are currently available to the Company. \n \u25aa In March 2020, the Company signed a term sheet with Ayrton Capital LLC for a $5.0 million non-interest bearing convertible note with a 10% original issue discount. The first tranche of $3.0 million is available upon closing with $2.0 million available seven months from the date of closing at the option of the Company. The note is repayable in twenty-two installments beginning three months after closing. While this transaction has not been completed as of March 26, 2020, management expects that the transaction will close prior to April 15, 2020. \n \u25aa In May 2019, the Company filed a Form S-3 prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission which became effective on June 19, 2019, and allows the Company to offer up to $100,000,000 aggregate dollar amount of shares of its common stock or other financial instruments. \nAs a result of management's cost reduction plans, the Company's potential sources of liquidity and management's most recent cash flow forecasts, management believes that the Company has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. However, there can be no assurance that management's cost reduction efforts will be effective, the forecasted cash flows will be achieved, or that external sources of financing,\nincluding the issuance of debt and/or equity securities, will be available at times and on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 162: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,374,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,890,786\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,385,177\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5,909,192\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,922,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,900,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated $2,374,868 in cash from operating activities, an increase in cash of $6,265,654 when compared to the cash used in operating activities of $3,890,786 during the same period in 2018. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily a result of a reduction in working capital requirements of $2,392,755, a reduction in net loss of $235,941, and an increase in non-cash adjustments of $3,636,958. Non-cash adjustments include increases of $4,049,059 comprised of the loss attributable to noncontrolling interest, deferred benefit for income taxes, loss on foreign currency transactions, provision for bad debt, impairment of goodwill, amortization of deferred gain, depreciation and amortization, inventory reserves, stock-based compensation expense an unrealized loss on forward currency contracts. These increases were offset by $(412,101) in decreases in non-cash adjustments attributable to, gain on disposal of property and equipment, provision, warranty reserves, and amortization of debt discount.\nWorking capital requirements decreased overall by $2,392,755. The sources of working capital of $3,770,079 were attributable to reductions in accounts receivable and prepaids and other assets, and increases in accounts payable for the comparable period. These sources were offset by uses of working capital due to increased inventory levels and reduced accrued expenses and other liabilities of $1,377,324.\nOur ability to generate cash from operations in future periods will depend in large part on our profitability, the rate and timing of collections of our accounts receivable, our inventory turns and our ability to manage other areas of working capital including accounts payable.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we used cash of $2,385,177 in investing activities as compared to $5,909,192 used during the same period in 2018, a decrease of $1,850,567. The expenditures in the current year are primarily due to tenant improvements to our headquarter facility and software costs and external consulting costs associated with the implementation of our ERP system for which phase one of the project was substantially completed in 2019. We currently do not anticipate any other significant purchases of equipment nor expansion of our ERP system beyond completion of phase II of the project, which is the integration of certain sales functions.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated $2,922,101 from financing activities as compared to the cash generated of $11,900,178 during the same period in 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we raised $1,500,000 from individuals and related parties through the issuance of notes payable that bear interest at an annual rate of 9.5% and are repaid through 24 months monthly installments. Additionally, during the third quarter of the year, the Company sold 1,554,832 shares of common stock for total gross proceeds of $2,700,714, which after commissions to brokers and other expenses resulted in net proceeds to us of $2,488,148. The Company also received proceeds of $47,334 from the exercise of warrants and stock options.\nBressner increased borrowing under its lines of credit for the purchase of inventories and also borrowed funds through term loans at interest rates of 2.125% - 2.250% that are repaid through monthly installments of up to 24 months.\nDuring year ended December 31, 2018, the Company received proceeds from the sale of common stock in our initial public offering of $19,500,000 which was offset by our stock issuance costs for commissions and third party professional services. We also received $113,168 from the exercise of warrants and stock options. With the proceeds from our initial public offering, we paid off our line of credit and retired all outstanding debt obligations.\nContractual obligations and commitments\nThe following table sets forth our non-cancellable contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019.\nTable 163: <table> <tr> <td> Contractual Obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Notes payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,327,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,969,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 358,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,414,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 713,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,489,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 211,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,742,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,682,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,847,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 211,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have made certain indemnities, under which the Company may be required to make payments to an indemnified party, in relation to certain transactions. We indemnify our directors, officers, employees and agents to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of the State of Delaware. In connection with our facilities leases, we indemnify our lessors for certain claims arising from the use of our facilities. The duration of the indemnities varies, and in many cases is indefinite. These indemnities do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential future payments we could be obligated to make. Historically, we have not been obligated to make any payments for these obligations and no liabilities have been recorded for these indemnities.\nOff balance sheet arrangements\nOther than lease commitments incurred in the normal course of business and certain indemnification provisions, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities, guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in transferred assets, or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity.\nWe do not have any majority-owned subsidiaries that are not consolidated in the financial statements. Additionally, we do not have an interest in, or relationships with, any special purpose entities.\nStockholder transactions\nEffective August 1, 2016, we entered into a management services agreement with a company owned by the former Chief Executive Officer of Magma. The agreement called for payments of $180,000 per year for the first two years paid in monthly installments. In year three, the amount was reduced to $37,500 for the year paid in monthly installments. Additionally, we granted 30,000 options in conjunction with execution of this agreement. Payments for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $21,875 and $120,635, respectively. Such management services agreement has been now fully completed.\nIn April 2019, certain members of the Company's Board of Directors executed definitive agreements to commit funds of up to $4,000,000 as a credit facility. The Company initially borrowed $1,150,000 from members of the Board of Directors and $350,000 from other shareholders for a two year period at an interest rate of 9.5% which requires the Company to make monthly principal and interest payment of $69,000 per month. In connection with these loans, the Company issued the note holders warrants to purchase shares of the Company's common stock equal to 10% of the original principal as a price per share equal to $2.15 per share. Accordingly, the Company issued to the note holders warrants to purchase 69,766 shares of the Company's common stock. The relative fair value of the warrants issued was $60,158.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we\nbelieve to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates. The critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nOn January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the new accounting standard update ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which superseded nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP, to all contracts using the modified retrospective method. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.\nThe Company's performance obligations are satisfied over time as work is performed or at a point in time. The majority of the Company's revenue is recognized at a point in time when products ship and control is transferred to the customer. The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied.\nThe Company's contracts are executed through a combination of written agreements along with purchase orders with all customers including certain general terms and conditions. Generally, purchase orders entail products, quantities and prices, which define the performance obligations of each party and are approved and accepted by the Company. The Company's contracts with customers do not include extended payment terms. Payment terms vary by contract type and type of customer and generally range from 30 to 60 days from invoice. Additionally, taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer and deposited with the relevant government authority, are excluded from revenue.\nThe transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer adjusted for estimated variable consideration, if any. Variable consideration may include discounts, rights of return, refunds, and other similar obligations. The Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct product and service based on its relative standalone selling price. The standalone selling price for products primarily involves the cost to produce the deliverable plus the anticipated margin and for services is estimated based on the Company's approved list price.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company does not accept product returns unless the items are defective as manufactured. The Company establishes provisions for estimated returns and warranties. In addition, the Company does not typically provide customers with the right to a refund and does not transact for noncash consideration.\nCustomer agreements include one vendor managed inventory program. The Company recognizes revenue under this arrangement when all of the following criteria are met: (i) the goods have been identified separately as belonging to the customer; (ii) the goods are ready for physical shipment to the customer; (iii) the Company does not have the ability to direct the goods to another customer; and (iv) the arrangement was requested by the customer and that the customer has sufficiently explained a substantial business purpose for the arrangement. Management also considers whether the customer's custodial risks are insured and whether modifications to the Company's normal billing and credit terms were required.\nRevenues on certain fixed-price contracts where we provide engineering services, prototypes and completed products are recognized based upon percentage of completion or based upon milestones delivered that are provided during the period and compared to milestone goals to be provided over the entire contract. These services require that we perform significant, extensive and complex design, development, modification or implementation of our customers' systems. Performance will often extend over long periods of time, and our right to receive future payment depends on our future performance in accordance with the agreement.\nThe percentage-of-completion methodology involves recognizing probable and reasonably estimable revenue using the percentage of services completed, on a current cumulative cost to estimated total cost basis, using a reasonably consistent profit margin over the performance period. Due to the long-term nature of these projects, developing the estimates of costs often requires significant judgment. Factors that must be considered in estimating the progress of work completed and ultimate cost of the projects include, but are not limited to, the availability of labor and labor productivity, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and the impact of delayed performance. If changes occur in delivery, productivity or other factors used in developing the estimates of costs or revenues, we revise our cost and revenue estimates, which may result in increases or decreases in revenues and costs, and such revisions are reflected in earnings in the period in which the revision becomes known.\nOn certain contracts with several of the Company's significant customers, the Company receives payments in advance of manufacturing. Advanced payments are recorded as deferred revenue until the revenue recognition criteria described above has been met.\nRelated billings that are in excess of revenue earned are deferred and recorded as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet until the related services are provided. Deferred revenue was $24,718 and $133,995 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company recognizes revenues for non-refundable, upfront implementation fees on a straight-line basis over the period beginning with initiation of ongoing services through the end of the contract term.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards granted to our employees and other service providers, including stock options granted under the 2017 Plan and 2015 Stock Option Plan that was approved in December 2015 (the 2015 Plan\u201d), based on the estimated fair value of the award. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards granted under the 2017 Plan and 2015 Plan. We recognize the fair value of stock options granted under the 2017 Plan and 2015 Plan as stock-based compensation on a straight line basis over the requisite service period. We record expense net of anticipated forfeitures and adjust the annual expense based upon actual experience.\nCompensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related service period. The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period.\nOur use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the fair value of the underlying common stock, expected term of the option, expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. The assumptions used in our option pricing model represent management's best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nThese assumptions and estimates are as follows:\n \u2022 Fair Value of Common Stock. Since the completion of our IPO, we use the closing quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant. \n \u2022 Expected Term. The expected term represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. The expected term assumptions were determined based on the vesting terms and contractual lives of the options, using the simplified method. \n \u2022 Expected Volatility. Since we do not have sufficient trading history of our common stock, the expected volatility was determined based on the historical stock volatilities of comparable companies. Comparable companies consist of public companies in our industry that is similar in size, stage of life cycle and financial leverage. We intend to continue to apply this process using the same or similar public companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own share price becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the identified companies are no longer similar to us, in which case, more suitable companies whose share prices are publicly available would be used in the calculation. \n \u2022 Risk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options. \n \u2022 Dividend Rate. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future, and, therefore, use an expected dividend yield of zero. \nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions"}
