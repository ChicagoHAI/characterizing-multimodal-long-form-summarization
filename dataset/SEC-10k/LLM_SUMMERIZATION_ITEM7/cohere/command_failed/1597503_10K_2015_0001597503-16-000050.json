Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d and risk factors in Part I. Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d of this report. References to NSAM,\u201d we,\u201d us\u201d or our\u201d refer to NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context specifically requires otherwise.\nIntroduction\nWe are a global asset management firm focused on strategically managing real estate and other investment platforms in the United States and internationally. We commenced operations on July 1, 2014 upon the NSAM Spin-off. The NSAM Spin-off was in the form of a tax-free distribution to NorthStar Realty's common stockholders where each NorthStar Realty common stockholder received shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis. At the same time, NorthStar Realty became externally managed by our affiliate through a management contract with an initial term of 20 years. NorthStar Realty continues to operate its CRE debt origination business. Most of NorthStar Realty's employees at the time of the NSAM Spin-off became our employees.\nOn October 31, 2015, NorthStar Realty completed the previously announced NRE Spin-off into a separate publicly-traded REIT, NorthStar Europe. We manage NorthStar Europe pursuant to a long-term management agreement, on substantially similar terms as our management agreement with NorthStar Realty.\nWe are organized to provide asset management and other services to our Managed Companies, or any other companies we may sponsor in the future, both in the United States and internationally. Our Managed Companies have historically invested in the CRE industry. We seek to expand the scope of our asset management business beyond real estate into new asset classes and geographies by organically creating and managing additional investment vehicles or through acquisitions, strategic partnerships and joint ventures.\nWe earn asset management and other fees, directly or indirectly, pursuant to management and other contracts and direct investments. In addition, we own NorthStar Securities, a captive broker-dealer platform registered with the SEC which raises capital in the retail market for our Sponsored Companies.\nAs of December 31, 2015, adjusted for Townsend and sales, acquisitions and commitments to sell or acquire investments by our Managed Companies, we had $38 billion of assets under management. In addition, inception to date, we invested $100 million in direct investments in entities that manage $10 billion, including assets held by our Managed Companies, across a variety of asset classes. We may also make opportunistic investments that take advantage of market dynamics, such as our recent purchases of NorthStar Realty common stock.\nTownsend Acquisition\nOn January 29, 2016, we acquired an approximate 84% interest in Townsend, a leading global provider of investment management and advisory services focused on real assets. Founded in 1983, Townsend is the manager or advisor to approximately $184 billion of real assets. Townsend's management team owns the remainder of the business and continues to direct day-to-day operations. We acquired the interest in Townsend for approximately $383 million, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. In connection with the acquisition, we obtained a $500 million term loan, which was used to fund the transaction, repay in full the amount outstanding under our revolving credit agreement and for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our common stock.\nStrategic Opportunities\nIn January 2016, our board of directors announced that it had engaged Goldman Sachs to assist us in exploring strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value. There is no assurance that this exploration will result in any transaction being announced or consummated.\nSummary of Business\nOur primary business lines are as follows:\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>NorthStar Listed Companies - Provide asset management and other services on a fee basis by managing the day-to-day activities of our NorthStar Listed Companies.

In addition, includes opportunistic investments, such as our recent purchase of NorthStar Realty's common stock.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Sources of Operating Revenues and Cash Flows\nWe primarily generate revenue from asset management and other fee income pursuant to contractual arrangements with our Managed Companies. We also generate revenue from commission income from selling equity in our Sponsored Companies. Effective July 1, 2014, we began generating revenue from asset management and other fee income from NorthStar Realty in addition to our Sponsored Companies. Effective November 1, 2015, we began generating revenue from asset management and other fee income from NorthStar Europe. Additionally, we record equity in earnings and receive distributions from our unconsolidated ventures.\nProfitability and Performance Metrics\nWe calculate certain metrics to evaluate the profitability and performance of our business.\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>CAD is a non-GAAP measure that provides investors and management with a meaningful indicator of operating performance (refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measure\u201d for a description of this metric); and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our ability to raise capital for our Managed Companies, which in turn grows the assets of our Managed Companies, is a driver of our ability to grow our fee income.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Outlook and Recent Trends\nAs an asset manager, we and the assets of our Managed Companies are impacted by general market and economic conditions. We have focused to date on strategically managing our real estate investments platform but we may determine to expand the breadth of our business. Historically, we have principally managed U.S. CRE assets and have more recently expanded internationally. Consequently, global markets and economic conditions will have an impact on our business.\nThe U.S. economy has improved, with the Federal Reserve raising the Federal Funds Rate for the first time in nine years in December 2015. Concerns remain regarding low inflation in the United States, a stronger U.S. dollar, slow global growth and international market volatility. Many other global central banks are easing monetary conditions to combat their low inflation and stagnant growth. Recently, concerns over global economic conditions, geopolitical issues, deflation, foreign exchange rates, the availability and cost of credit, the sovereign debt crisis, the Chinese economy, the U.S. mortgage market and a potentially weakening real estate market in the United States have contributed to increased economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy. These factors, combined with volatile prices of oil and declining business and consumer confidence, may precipitate an economic slowdown, as well as cause extreme volatility in security prices. The concern of a possible recession is resulting in uncertainty regarding the timing of the next Federal Reserve increase to the Federal Funds Rate.\nThe European economy continues to steadily recover. However, regional disparities continue to persist as economies recover at different speeds. We believe that the European Central Bank's recently expanded quantitative easing\u201d program, which the European Central Bank president has signaled could be further expanded if necessary, along with historically low interest rates, the depreciation of the euro and lower energy prices has nonetheless created a compelling long-term investment environment in Europe. As financial institutions continue to deleverage, we anticipate that there will be further opportunities to acquire portfolios and assets at an attractive long term basis.\nGiven market conditions at the end of 2015 and into 2016, our NorthStar Listed Companies are constrained by their inability to access the capital markets. CRE fundamentals remain relatively healthy across U.S. property types. Robust investor demand in 2014 for commercial real estate increased transaction activity and prices as rent and vacancy fundamentals improved across most property sectors and continued to improve in 2015, especially in the real estate private markets. However, property price appreciation has slowed and the markets may be in the later stage of the current real estate cycle and could lead to a recession.\nGlobal economic and political headwinds, along with global market instability and the risk that maturing commercial real estate debt may have difficulties being refinanced, among other factors, may continue to cause periodic volatility in the commercial real estate market for some time. It is currently estimated that approximately $1.4 trillion of commercial real estate debt in the United States will mature through 2018. While there appears to be a supply of available liquidity and improved fundamentals in the commercial real estate market, we still anticipate that certain of these loans will not be able to be refinanced, potentially inhibiting growth and contracting credit.\nAs an active asset manager in the retail capital raising industry, historically focusing on the non-traded sector, we are continually monitoring market fundamentals and trends. After showing resiliency during the economic downturn between 2007 and 2010, the non-traded REIT sector experienced strong growth over recent years peaking in 2013 with approximately $20 billion of equity being raised for programs in this space, largely influenced by high volume of liquidity events due to favorable capital markets conditions. Non-traded REIT capital raising was down 20% in 2014 (with approximately $16 billion dollars in equity sales) and\n2015 sales were down 36% compared to 2014. Despite this declining industry trend, our Sponsored Companies have continued to gain market share with our non-traded REITs having a 7% market share in 2014 and 13% market share in 2015. We expect to continue to gain market share in the non-traded REIT market as well as the overall retail market as our institutional-quality sponsorship, rapidly broadening product line and innovative structures create opportunities to differentiate our platform in the marketplace during the implementation of FINRA 15-02 related to Broker Dealer account statements and the U.S. Department of Labor's recent proposal on a fiduciary standard for retirement accounts.\nFollowing the NSAM Spin-off, our assets under management grew substantially in part because of the significant capital raising activity at NorthStar Realty. Recent volatility in the equity markets has diminished our NorthStar Listed Companies' capital raising activity and this environment could continue for an extended period of time.\nDue to our expertise and industry relationships, we continue to see a robust pipeline of investment opportunities that have credit qualities and yield profiles that are consistent with our underwriting standards and that we believe offer the opportunity to meet or exceed our Managed Companies targeted returns, thereby increasing our assets under management and fee income. We also believe the opportunity exists to accelerate our growth through accretive investments in third party asset managers. While we remain optimistic that we will continue to be able to generate and capitalize on an attractive pipeline of opportunities, there is no assurance that will be the case.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nVariable Interest Entities\nA variable interest entity, or VIE, is an entity that lacks one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity. A VIE is defined as an entity in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The determination of whether an entity is a VIE includes both a qualitative and quantitative analysis. We base the qualitative analysis on our review of the design of the entity, its organizational structure including decision-making ability and relevant financial agreements and the quantitative analysis on the forecasted cash flow of the entity.\nWe reassess the initial evaluation of an entity as a VIE upon the occurrence of certain reconsideration events.\nA VIE must be consolidated only by its primary beneficiary, which is defined as the party who, along with its affiliates and agents has both the: (i) power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance; and (ii) obligation to absorb the losses of the VIE or the right to receive the benefits from the VIE, which could be significant to the VIE. We determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE by considering qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to: which activities most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and which party controls such activities; the amount and characteristics of its investment; the obligation or likelihood for us or other interests to provide financial support; consideration of the VIE's purpose and design, including the risks the VIE was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders and the similarity with and significance to our business activities and the other interests. We reassess the determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE each reporting period. Significant judgments related to these determinations include estimates about the current and future fair value and performance of investments held by these VIEs and general market conditions.\nWe evaluate our Managed Companies, investments in unconsolidated ventures and securitization financing transactions to which we are the special servicer to determine whether they are a VIE. We analyze new investments and financings, as well as reconsideration events for existing investments and financings, which vary depending on type of investment or financing.\nVoting Interest Entities\nA voting interest entity is an entity in which the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable it to finance its activities independently and the equity holders have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance, the obligation to absorb the losses of the entity and the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The usual condition for a controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity is ownership of a majority voting interest. If we have a majority voting interest in a voting interest entity, the entity will generally be consolidated. We do not consolidate a voting interest entity if there are substantive participating rights by other parties and/or kick-out rights by a single party or through a simple majority vote.\nWe perform on-going reassessments of whether entities previously evaluated under the voting interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Ventures\nA non-controlling, unconsolidated ownership interest in an entity may be accounted for using the equity method, at fair value or the cost method.\nUnder the equity method, the investment is adjusted each period for capital contributions and distributions and its share of the entity's net income (loss). Capital contributions, distributions and net income (loss) of such entities are recorded in accordance with the terms of the governing documents. An allocation of net income (loss) may differ from the stated ownership percentage interest in such entity as a result of a preferred return and allocation formula, if any, as described in such governing documents.\nWe may account for an investment in an unconsolidated entity at fair value by electing the fair value option. We record the change in fair value for our share of the projected future cash flow of such investments from one period to another in equity in earnings (losses) from unconsolidated ventures in the consolidated statements of operations. Any change in fair value attributed to market related assumptions is considered unrealized gain (loss).\nWe may account for an investment that does not qualify for equity method accounting or for which the fair value option was not elected using the cost method if we determine the investment in the unconsolidated entity is insignificant. Under the cost method, equity in earnings is recorded as dividends are received to the extent they are not considered a return of capital, which is recorded as a reduction of cost of the investment.\nEstimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that could affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates and assumptions.\nSecurities\nWe elected to apply the fair value option for our securities investments. Any unrealized gain (loss) from the change in fair value is recorded in unrealized gains (losses) on investments and other in the consolidated statements of operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nAsset Management and Other Fees\nAsset management and other fees include asset management and other fees, such as acquisition and disposition fees, earned from our Managed Companies. Base asset management and other fees are recognized based on contractual terms specified in the underlying governing documents in the periods during which the related services are performed and the amounts have been contractually earned. Incentive fees and payments are recognized subject to the achievement of return hurdles in accordance with the respective terms set forth in the governing documents of our Managed Companies.\nSelling Commission and Dealer Manager Fees and Commission Expense\nSelling commission and dealer manager fees represent income earned by us for selling equity in our Sponsored Companies through NorthStar Securities. Selling commission and dealer manager fees and commission expense are accrued on a trade date basis.\nFair Value Measurement\nWe follow fair value guidance in accordance with U.S. GAAP to account for our financial instruments. We categorize our financial instruments, based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique, into a three-level fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).\nFinancial assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets and are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows:\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level 1.\n</td> <td>Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level 2.\n</td> <td>Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on the following:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(b)\n</td> <td>Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(c)\n</td> <td>Pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 216: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(d)\n</td> <td>Pricing models whose inputs are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 217: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level 3.\n</td> <td>Prices or valuation techniques based on inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair\n</td> </tr>\n</table> value measurement.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our recurring financial measurements recorded at fair value were our securities. Such securities are valued using quoted prices in an active market, and as such, is classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. As of December 31, 2014, we did not have any recurring financial measurements recorded at fair value.\nEquity-Based Compensation\nWe account for equity-based compensation awards, including awards granted to co-employees, using the fair value method, which requires an estimate of the fair value of the award. Awards may be based on a variety of measures such as time, performance, market or a combination thereof. For time-based awards, fair value is determined based on the stock price on the grant date. We recognize compensation expense over the vesting period on a straight-line basis or the attribution method depending if the grant is to an employee or non-employee. For performance-based awards, fair value is determined based on the stock price at the date of grant and an estimate of the probable achievement of such measure. We recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated attribution expense method. For market-based measures, fair value is determined using a Monte Carlo analysis under a risk-neutral premise using a risk-free interest rate. We recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis.\nFor awards with a combination of performance or market measures, we estimate the fair value as if it were two separate awards. First, we estimate the probability of achieving the performance measure. If it is not probable the performance condition will be met, we recognize the compensation expense based on the fair value of the market measure, as described above. This expense is recorded even if the market-based measure is never met. If the performance-based measure is subsequently estimated to be achieved, we record compensation expense based on the performance-based measure. We would then record a cumulative catch-up adjustment for any additional compensation expense.\nEquity-based compensation issued to non-employees is accounted for using the fair value of the award at the earlier of the performance commitment date or performance completion date. The awards are remeasured every quarter based on the stock price as of the end of the reporting period until such awards vest, if any.\nIncome Taxes\nCertain of our subsidiaries are subject to taxation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities for the periods presented. On March 13, 2015, we restructured forming our new operating partnership, or Operating Partnership, under Delaware law, by converting an existing limited liability company disregarded as separate from us for federal income tax purposes to a Delaware limited partnership and admitting as limited partners LTIP Unit Holders. The Operating Partnership is taxed as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and consequently, its items of income gain, loss, deduction and credit are passed through to, and included in, the taxable income of each of its partners including us. For the period prior to March 13, 2015, we and our U.S. subsidiaries will file consolidated federal income tax returns. Income taxes are accounted for by the asset/liability approach in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Deferred taxes, if any, represent the expected future tax consequences when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. Such amounts arise from differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax laws and tax rates in the period which such changes are enacted. A provision for income tax represents the total of income taxes paid or payable for the current period, plus the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an accounting update requiring a company to recognize as revenue the amount of consideration it expects to be entitled to in connection with the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The accounting standard update will replace most of the existing revenue recognition guidance currently promulgated by U.S. GAAP. In July 2015, the FASB decided to delay the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year. The effective date of the new revenue standard for us will be January 1, 2018. We are in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, of the update on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance that changes the rules regarding consolidation. The pronouncement eliminates specialized guidance for limited partnerships and similar legal entities and removes the indefinite deferral for certain investment funds. The new guidance is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt the new standard on January 1, 2016 and it is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued an accounting update changing the presentation of financing costs in financial statements. Under the new guidance, an entity would present these costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs would continue to be reported as interest expense. The new guidance is effective for annual periods and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. In the fourth quarter 2015,\nwe adopted this guidance and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance that eliminates the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. Under the new guidance, an acquirer will recognize a measurement-period adjustment during the period in which it determines the amount of the adjustment. The new guidance is effective for annual periods and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. We adopted this guidance in the third quarter 2015 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting update that addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently assessing the impact of the guidance on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting update that requires lessees to present right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The new guidance is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach at the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2014 (dollars in thousands):\nThe following table represents our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands):\nThe consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 represent our results of operations following the NSAM Spin-off on June 30, 2014. The year ended December 31, 2014 includes: (i) our results of operations for the six months ended December 31, 2014, which represents our activity following the NSAM Spin-off; and (ii) our results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2014, which represents a carve-out of its historical financial information including revenues and expenses attributable to us related to NorthStar Realty's historical asset management business. As a result, the year ended December 31, 2015 may not be comparable to the prior period presented.\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

The increase is primarily the result of more services performed in 2015.\nExpenses\nCommission Expense\nCommission expense represents fees to participating broker-dealers with whom we have selling agreements to raise capital for our Sponsored Companies and commissions to employees of NorthStar Securities. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we paid $14.0 million and $7.8 million, respectively, to NorthStar Securities employees. Commission income and expense both increased due to higher capital raising activity for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense relates to our revolving credit agreement that we entered into in November 2015, in our corporate segment.\nTransaction Costs\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, transaction costs represent a one-time buyout in satisfaction of all participating interests related to NorthStar Income in our corporate segment and professional fees associated with the acquisition of our interest in Townsend in our direct investments segment. For the year ended December 31, 2014, transaction costs represents costs such as professional fees associated with the NSAM Spin-off in our corporate segment.\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses increased primarily due to the base management fees we pay to AHI for the year ended December 31, 2015 in our corporate segment. Such fees only began to be paid in December 2014.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses are principally incurred at the corporate level except as it relates to direct compensation expense and other costs incurred at our broker-dealer, which is part of our broker-dealer segment. In addition, the amount of general and administrative expenses reflects an offset from an allocation of costs of $10.3 million to our NorthStar Listed Companies and $36.6 million to our Sponsored Companies for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $52.6 million primarily attributable to the following:\nSalaries and related expense increased $31.1 million primarily due to most employees of NorthStar Realty becoming our employees upon the NSAM Spin-off as well as hiring additional employees for increased activity at our Managed Companies.\nEquity-based compensation expense is comprised of (dollars in thousands):\nTable 232: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Time-Based Awards\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Performance-Based Awards\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NSAM spin grants(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NSAM bonus plan\n</td> <td>9,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NorthStar Realty bonus plan(2)\n</td> <td>9,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Grants to non-employees\n</td> <td>1,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________\nTable 233: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Represents equity-based compensation expense for one-time grants issued related to the NSAM Spin-off.

Pursuant to dealer manager agreements between NorthStar Securities and our Sponsored Companies, we generally receive selling commissions of up to 7% of gross offering proceeds raised, which we reallow to participating broker-dealers. In addition, we also generally receive a dealer manager fee of up to 3% of gross offering proceeds raised, a portion of which may be reallowed to participating broker-dealers and paid to certain employees of NorthStar Securities.\nSelling commission and dealer manager fees increased due to higher capital raising activity for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013.\nThe following table presents equity raised by our Sponsored Companies for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\nTable 243: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NorthStar Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>545,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NorthStar Healthcare\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>867,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NorthStar Income II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>280,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,190,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>682,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________\nTable 244: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes capital raised through dividend reinvestment plans of $59.0 million and $33.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, for which NorthStar Securities did not earn commission income.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 245: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>NorthStar Income successfully completed its primary offering on July 1, 2013.

We are a rated special servicer by Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings and we receive special servicing fees for services related to certain securitization transactions. The increase is primarily the result of more services performed in 2014.\nExpenses\nCommission Expense\nCommission expense represents fees to participating broker-dealers with whom we have selling agreements to raise capital for our Sponsored Companies and commissions to employees of NorthStar Securities. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we paid $7.8 million and $5.4 million, respectively, to NorthStar Securities employees. Commission income and expense both increased due to higher capital raising activity for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013.\nTransaction Costs\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, transaction costs represent costs such as professional fees associated with the NSAM Spin-off in our corporate segment. The increase of $22.9 million is primarily due to the NSAM Spin-off in 2014.\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses primarily represents depreciation expense, legal and other expenses associated with our broker-dealer and special servicing businesses in our corporate segment.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses are principally incurred at the corporate level except as it relates to direct compensation expense and other costs incurred at our broker-dealer, which is part of our broker-dealer segment.

In connection with the NSAM Spin-off, we have available under a revolving credit agreement with NorthStar Realty up to $250 million of financing to us subject to certain conditions (refer to Related Party Arrangements). In November 2015, in connection with the Townsend acquisition, we simultaneously obtained a commitment for a $500 million term loan and entered into a $100 million revolving credit agreement, both of which were used to fund the transaction and for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our common stock. Upon the closing of Townsend, we entered into the $500 million term loan and used the proceeds to repay the revolving credit agreement and for general corporate purposes. In connection with the term loan, we obtained corporate issuer and issue credit ratings from S&P and Moody's of BBB- and Ba2, respectively. Our primary uses of liquidity include operating expenses, dividends, acquisitions of direct investments and repurchase of our common stock. On a quarterly basis, our board of directors determines an appropriate common stock dividend based upon numerous factors, including CAD, availability of existing cash balances, general economic conditions and economic conditions that more specifically impact our business or prospects. Future dividend levels are subject to adjustment based upon our evaluation of the factors described above, as well as other factors that our board of directors may, from time-to-time, deem relevant to consider when determining an appropriate common stock dividend.\nIn addition, in April 2015, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $400 million of our outstanding common stock. The authorization expires in April 2016, unless otherwise extended by our board of directors. As of December 31, 2015, we repurchased 7.8 million shares of our common stock for $105 million, with $295 million remaining under the authorization.\nWe expect that our cash flow from operating activities and available financing will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2015, we had a receivable, related parties balance primarily from our Managed Companies of $94 million, of which we received $54 million subsequent to December 31, 2015.\nWe currently believe that our existing sources of funds should be adequate for purposes of meeting our short-term liquidity needs. Unrestricted cash as of February 23, 2016, was approximately $96 million, including $42 million in the United States and $54 million outside the United States.\nCash Flows\nThe following presents a summary of our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):\nThe consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2015 represent our cash flow following the NSAM Spin-off on June 30, 2014. The consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2014 includes: (i) our cash flow for the six months ended December 31, 2014, which represents our cash flow following the NSAM Spin-off; and (ii) our cash flow for the six months ended June 30, 2014, which represents a carve-out of our historical financial information including revenues and expenses attributable to us related to NorthStar Realty's historical asset management business. The consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2013 was prepared on the same basis as the six months ended June 30, 2014. As a result, the year ended December 31, 2015 may not be comparable to the prior periods.\nTable 252: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>158,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,363\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(72,639\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(43,582\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(109,442\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(529\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(410\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(24,492\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>894\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to December 31, 2014\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $158 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $47 million provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was due to fees beginning to be earned on July 1, 2014 from NorthStar Realty and an increase in asset management and other fees from our Sponsored Companies due to more investment activity.

Cash flow used for the year ended December 31, 2015 was due to $105 million for the retirement of our shares, $78 million for the payment of dividends, $17 million for the call spread premium and $7 million for withholding tax related to vesting and net settlement of RSUs, offset by $100 million borrowed under the revolving credit agreement. Cash flow provided by for the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to our initial capitalization from NorthStar Realty.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to December 31, 2013\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $47 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $6 million used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily due to asset management and other fees from our Managed Companies and excludes $47 million of fees received subsequent to December 31, 2014, offset by an increase in operating expenses incurred to grow our business.\nNet cash used in investing activities represents investments in unconsolidated ventures, including the AHI Interest ($40 million) and Distribution Finance Interest ($4 million).\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $99 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Cash flow provided by for the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to the initial capital contribution upon the spin-off of $116 million which became effective on June 30, 2014 and an excess tax benefit of $2 million, offset by $19 million for the payment of dividends. Cash flow provided for the year ended December 31, 2013 was due to the NorthStar Realty contribution.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table presents contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 253: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017-2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019-2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,454\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving credit agreement(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________\nTable 254: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2015, we had contractual commitments under operating leases for our offices (refer to Commitments and Contingencies in Part II, Item 8.

Refer to Note 4. Investments in Unconsolidated Ventures\u201d in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for a discussion of such unconsolidated ventures in our consolidated financial statements. Our exposure to loss is limited to the carrying value of our investment.\nRelated Party Arrangements\nNorthStar Realty\nInvestment Opportunities\nUnder the management agreement, NorthStar Realty agreed to make available to us for the benefit of our Managed Companies, including NorthStar Realty, all investment opportunities sourced by NorthStar Realty. We agreed to fairly allocate such opportunities among our Managed Companies, including NorthStar Realty, in accordance with our investment allocation policy. Pursuant to the management agreement, NorthStar Realty is entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for its services in connection with any loan origination opportunities sourced by it, which may include first mortgage loans, subordinate mortgage interests, mezzanine loans and preferred equity interests, in each case relating to commercial real estate.\nWe provide services with regard to such areas as payroll, human resources and employee benefits, financial systems management, treasury and cash management, accounts payable services, telecommunications services, information technology services, property management services, legal and accounting services and various other corporate services to NorthStar Realty as it relates to its loan origination business for CRE debt.\nCredit Agreement\nIn connection with the NSAM Spin-off, we entered into a revolving credit agreement with NorthStar Realty pursuant to which NorthStar Realty makes available to us, on an as available basis,\u201d up to $250 million of financing with a maturity of June 30, 2019 at LIBOR plus 3.50%. The revolving credit facility is unsecured. We expect to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including potential future acquisitions. In addition, we may use the proceeds to acquire assets on behalf of our Managed Companies that we intend to allocate to such Managed Company but for which such Managed Company may not then have immediately available funds. The terms of the revolving credit facility contain various representations, warranties, covenants and conditions, including the condition that NorthStar Realty's obligation to advance proceeds to us is dependent upon NorthStar Realty and its affiliates having at least $100 million of either unrestricted cash and cash equivalents or amounts available under committed lines of credit, after taking into account the amount we seek to draw under the facility. As of December 31, 2015, we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement.\nNorthStar Realty Shares\nIn the fourth quarter 2015, we purchased 2.7 million shares of NorthStar Realty in the open market for $50 million.\nRecent Sales or Commitments to Sell to Sponsored Companies\nSubsequent to year end, NorthStar Realty entered into agreements to sell certain assets to our Sponsored Companies. The board of directors of each Sponsored Company, including all of the independent directors, approved of the respective transactions after considering, among other matters, third party pricing support.\nHealthcare Strategic Joint Venture\nIn January 2014, we entered into a long-term strategic partnership with James F. Flaherty III, former Chief Executive Officer of HCP, Inc., focused on expanding our healthcare business into a preeminent healthcare platform, or the Healthcare Strategic Partnership. In connection with the partnership, Mr. Flaherty oversees and seeks to grow both NorthStar Realty's healthcare real estate portfolio and the portfolio of NorthStar Healthcare. In connection with entering into the partnership, NorthStar Realty granted Mr. Flaherty certain RSUs, half of which became our RSUs as a result of NorthStar Realty's reverse stock split and the NSAM Spin-off. The Healthcare Strategic Partnership is entitled to incentive fees ranging from 20% to 25% above certain hurdles for new and existing healthcare real estate investments held by NorthStar Realty and NorthStar Healthcare. The partnership will also be entitled to any incentive fees earned from NorthStar Healthcare or any future healthcare non-traded vehicles sponsored by us, NorthStar Realty or any affiliates, as well as future healthcare non-traded vehicles sponsored by AHI Ventures. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we did not earn incentive fees related to the Healthcare Strategic Partnership. On February 2, 2015, in connection with the completion of NorthStar Healthcare's initial primary offering, we issued 20,305 RSUs to Mr. Flaherty. On December 17, 2015, in connection with NorthStar Healthcare's follow-on public offering, we issued 139,473 RSUs to Mr. Flaherty.\nAHI Venture\nIn connection with our 43% interest in American Healthcare Investors LLC, or AHI Interest, AHI Newco, LLC, or AHI Ventures, a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of AHI, provides certain asset management, property management and other services to our affiliates assisting in managing the current and future healthcare assets (excluding any joint venture assets) of NorthStar Realty and other Sponsored Companies, including the assets formerly owned by Griffin-American, and its former operating partnership, Griffin-American Healthcare REIT II Holdings, LP, or Griffin-America OP portfolio, and third party assets, representing $8 billion, of which $5 billion is owned by NorthStar Realty and NorthStar Healthcare. AHI Ventures receives a base management fee of $0.6 million per year plus 0.50% of the equity invested by NorthStar Realty in future healthcare assets (excluding assets in the Griffin-American OP portfolio and other joint ventures) that AHI Ventures may manage. AHI Ventures may also participate in the incentive fees earned by us and our affiliates with respect to new and existing healthcare real estate investments held by NorthStar Realty and NorthStar Healthcare, including the Griffin-American OP portfolio, any future healthcare non-traded vehicles sponsored by us, NorthStar Realty or any affiliates, as well as any future healthcare non-traded vehicles sponsored by AHI Ventures. AHI Ventures would also be entitled to additional base management fees should it manage assets on behalf of any other Managed Companies. AHI Ventures also intends to directly or indirectly sponsor, co-sponsor, form, register, market, advise, manage and/or operate investment vehicles that are intended to invest primarily in healthcare real estate assets. In addition, Mr. Flaherty acquired a 12% interest, as adjusted, in AHI Ventures. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $1 million of base management fees to AHI. Also, AHI provides certain asset management, property management and other services to NorthStar Realty to assist in managing its properties. For the year ended December 31, 2015 and the period from acquisition date (December 8, 2014) to December 31, 2014, NorthStar Realty incurred $2 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of property management fees to AHI.\nIn April 2015, Griffin-American Healthcare REIT III, Inc., a vehicle managed by an affiliate of AHI, distributed shares of its common stock to the members of AHI Ventures, of which we received 0.2 million shares in connection with the distribution.\nIsland Venture\nIsland is a leading, independent select service hotel management company that currently manages 160 hotel properties, representing $4 billion, of which 110 hotel properties totaling $2 billion, are owned by NorthStar Realty. Island provides certain asset management, property management and other services to NorthStar Realty to assist in managing its hotel properties. Island receives a base management fee of 2.5% to 3.0% of the current monthly revenue of the NorthStar Realty hotel properties it manages for NorthStar Realty. For the period from acquisition date (January 9, 2015) to December 31, 2015, NorthStar Realty incurred $17 million of base management and other fees to Island.\nRXR Realty\nIn December 2013, NorthStar Realty entered into a strategic transaction with RXR Realty, the co-sponsor of NorthStar/RXR New York Metro. The investment in RXR Realty includes an approximate 27% equity interest. NorthStar Realty's equity interest in RXR Realty is structured so that we are entitled to certain fees in connection with RXR Realty's investment management business.\nRecent Developments\nDividends\nOn February 24, 2016, we declared a dividend of $0.10 per share of common stock. The common stock dividend will be paid on March 11, 2016 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 7, 2016.\nTownsend Acquisition\nOn January 29, 2016, we acquired an approximate 84% interest in Townsend, a leading global provider of investment management and advisory services focused on real assets. Founded in 1983, Townsend is the manager or advisor to approximately $184 billion of real assets. Townsend's management team owns the remainder of the business and continues to direct day-to-day operations. We acquired the interest in Townsend for approximately $383 million, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. In connection with the acquisition, we obtained a $500 million term loan, which was used to fund the transaction, repay in full the amount outstanding under our revolving credit agreement and for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our common stock.\nStrategic Opportunities\nIn January 2016, our board of directors announced that it had engaged Goldman Sachs to assist us in exploring strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value. There is no assurance that this exploration will result in any transaction being announced or consummated.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure\nWe believe that CAD provides investors and management with a meaningful indicator of operating performance. Management also uses CAD, among other measures, to evaluate profitability. In addition, the incentive fees to which we are entitled pursuant to our management agreements with each of our NorthStar Listed Companies are determined using such NorthStar Listed Company's CAD as a performance metric. We believe that CAD is useful because it adjusts net income (loss) for a variety of non-cash, one-time and certain non-recurring items.\nWe calculate CAD by subtracting from or adding to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, non-controlling interests attributable to the Operating Partnership and the following items: equity-based compensation, depreciation related items, amortization of deferred financing costs, foreign currency gains (losses), straight-line rent, adjustments for joint ventures, deferred tax benefit (expense) related to timing differences that are not expected to reverse in the current year, unrealized (gain) loss from fair value adjustments and transaction and other costs. In future periods, such adjustments may include impairment on goodwill and other intangible assets and other one-time events pursuant to changes in U.S. GAAP and certain other non-recurring items. These items, if applicable, include any adjustments for unconsolidated ventures. Management also believes that quarterly distributions are principally based on operating performance and our board of directors includes CAD as one of several metrics it reviews to determine quarterly distributions to stockholders.\nCAD should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance. In addition, our methodology for calculating CAD involves subjective judgment and discretion, and may differ from the methodologies used by other comparable companies when calculating the same or similar supplemental financial measures and may not be comparable with these companies.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of CAD to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders for the three months and year ended December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 256: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d and risk factors in Part I. Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d of this report. References to NSAM,\u201d we,\u201d us\u201d or our\u201d refer to NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context specifically requires otherwise.\nIntroduction\nWe are a global asset management firm focused on strategically managing real estate and other investment platforms in the United States and internationally. We commenced operations on July 1, 2014 upon the NSAM Spin-off. The NSAM Spin-off was in the form of a tax-free distribution to NorthStar Realty's common stockholders where each NorthStar Realty common stockholder received shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis. At the same time, NorthStar Realty became externally managed by our affiliate through a management contract with an initial term of 20 years. NorthStar Realty continues to operate its CRE debt origination business. Most of NorthStar Realty's employees at the time of the NSAM Spin-off became our employees.\nOn October 31, 2015, NorthStar Realty completed the previously announced NRE Spin-off into a separate publicly-traded REIT, NorthStar Europe. We manage NorthStar Europe pursuant to a long-term management agreement, on substantially similar terms as our management agreement with NorthStar Realty.\nWe are organized to provide asset management and other services to our Managed Companies, or any other companies we may sponsor in the future, both in the United States and internationally. Our Managed Companies have historically invested in the CRE industry. We seek to expand the scope of our asset management business beyond real estate into new asset classes and geographies by organically creating and managing additional investment vehicles or through acquisitions, strategic partnerships and joint ventures.\nWe earn asset management and other fees, directly or indirectly, pursuant to management and other contracts and direct investments. In addition, we own NorthStar Securities, a captive broker-dealer platform registered with the SEC which raises capital in the retail market for our Sponsored Companies.\nAs of December 31, 2015, adjusted for Townsend and sales, acquisitions and commitments to sell or acquire investments by our Managed Companies, we had $38 billion of assets under management. In addition, inception to date, we invested $100 million in direct investments in entities that manage $10 billion, including assets held by our Managed Companies, across a variety of asset classes. We may also make opportunistic investments that take advantage of market dynamics, such as our recent purchases of NorthStar Realty common stock.\nTownsend Acquisition\nOn January 29, 2016, we acquired an approximate 84% interest in Townsend, a leading global provider of investment management and advisory services focused on real assets. Founded in 1983, Townsend is the manager or advisor to approximately $184 billion of real assets. Townsend's management team owns the remainder of the business and continues to direct day-to-day operations. We acquired the interest in Townsend for approximately $383 million, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. In connection with the acquisition, we obtained a $500 million term loan, which was used to fund the transaction, repay in full the amount outstanding under our revolving credit agreement and for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our common stock.\nStrategic Opportunities\nIn January 2016, our board of directors announced that it had engaged Goldman Sachs to assist us in exploring strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value. There is no assurance that this exploration will result in any transaction being announced or consummated.\nSummary of Business\nOur primary business lines are as follows:\n \u2022 NorthStar Listed Companies - Provide asset management and other services on a fee basis by managing the day-to-day activities of our NorthStar Listed Companies. We began earning fees from NorthStar Realty on July 1, 2014 and NorthStar Europe on November 1, 2015. \n \u2022 Sponsored Companies - Provide asset management and other services on a fee basis by managing the day-to-day activities of our Sponsored Companies. \n \u2022 Broker-dealer - Raise capital in the retail market through NorthStar Securities and earn dealer manager fees from our Sponsored Companies. \n \u2022 Direct Investments - Invest in strategic partnerships and joint ventures with third-parties with expertise in commercial real estate or other sectors and markets, where we benefit from the fee stream and potential incentive fee or promote. \n \u2022 Corporate/other - Includes corporate level general and administrative expenses, as well as special servicing on a fee basis in connection with certain securitization transactions. In addition, includes opportunistic investments, such as our recent purchase of NorthStar Realty's common stock.  Sources of Operating Revenues and Cash Flows\nWe primarily generate revenue from asset management and other fee income pursuant to contractual arrangements with our Managed Companies. We also generate revenue from commission income from selling equity in our Sponsored Companies. Effective July 1, 2014, we began generating revenue from asset management and other fee income from NorthStar Realty in addition to our Sponsored Companies. Effective November 1, 2015, we began generating revenue from asset management and other fee income from NorthStar Europe. Additionally, we record equity in earnings and receive distributions from our unconsolidated ventures.\nProfitability and Performance Metrics\nWe calculate certain metrics to evaluate the profitability and performance of our business.\n \u2022 CAD is a non-GAAP measure that provides investors and management with a meaningful indicator of operating performance (refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measure\u201d for a description of this metric); and \n \u2022 Our ability to raise capital for our Managed Companies, which in turn grows the assets of our Managed Companies, is a driver of our ability to grow our fee income.  Outlook and Recent Trends\nAs an asset manager, we and the assets of our Managed Companies are impacted by general market and economic conditions. We have focused to date on strategically managing our real estate investments platform but we may determine to expand the breadth of our business. Historically, we have principally managed U.S. CRE assets and have more recently expanded internationally. Consequently, global markets and economic conditions will have an impact on our business.\nThe U.S. economy has improved, with the Federal Reserve raising the Federal Funds Rate for the first time in nine years in December 2015. Concerns remain regarding low inflation in the United States, a stronger U.S. dollar, slow global growth and international market volatility. Many other global central banks are easing monetary conditions to combat their low inflation and stagnant growth. Recently, concerns over global economic conditions, geopolitical issues, deflation, foreign exchange rates, the availability and cost of credit, the sovereign debt crisis, the Chinese economy, the U.S. mortgage market and a potentially weakening real estate market in the United States have contributed to increased economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy. These factors, combined with volatile prices of oil and declining business and consumer confidence, may precipitate an economic slowdown, as well as cause extreme volatility in security prices. The concern of a possible recession is resulting in uncertainty regarding the timing of the next Federal Reserve increase to the Federal Funds Rate.\nThe European economy continues to steadily recover. However, regional disparities continue to persist as economies recover at different speeds. We believe that the European Central Bank's recently expanded quantitative easing\u201d program, which the European Central Bank president has signaled could be further expanded if necessary, along with historically low interest rates, the depreciation of the euro and lower energy prices has nonetheless created a compelling long-term investment environment in Europe. As financial institutions continue to deleverage, we anticipate that there will be further opportunities to acquire portfolios and assets at an attractive long term basis.\nGiven market conditions at the end of 2015 and into 2016, our NorthStar Listed Companies are constrained by their inability to access the capital markets. CRE fundamentals remain relatively healthy across U.S. property types. Robust investor demand in 2014 for commercial real estate increased transaction activity and prices as rent and vacancy fundamentals improved across most property sectors and continued to improve in 2015, especially in the real estate private markets. However, property price appreciation has slowed and the markets may be in the later stage of the current real estate cycle and could lead to a recession.\nGlobal economic and political headwinds, along with global market instability and the risk that maturing commercial real estate debt may have difficulties being refinanced, among other factors, may continue to cause periodic volatility in the commercial real estate market for some time. It is currently estimated that approximately $1.4 trillion of commercial real estate debt in the United States will mature through 2018. While there appears to be a supply of available liquidity and improved fundamentals in the commercial real estate market, we still anticipate that certain of these loans will not be able to be refinanced, potentially inhibiting growth and contracting credit.\nAs an active asset manager in the retail capital raising industry, historically focusing on the non-traded sector, we are continually monitoring market fundamentals and trends. After showing resiliency during the economic downturn between 2007 and 2010, the non-traded REIT sector experienced strong growth over recent years peaking in 2013 with approximately $20 billion of equity being raised for programs in this space, largely influenced by high volume of liquidity events due to favorable capital markets conditions. Non-traded REIT capital raising was down 20% in 2014 (with approximately $16 billion dollars in equity sales) and\n2015 sales were down 36% compared to 2014. Despite this declining industry trend, our Sponsored Companies have continued to gain market share with our non-traded REITs having a 7% market share in 2014 and 13% market share in 2015. We expect to continue to gain market share in the non-traded REIT market as well as the overall retail market as our institutional-quality sponsorship, rapidly broadening product line and innovative structures create opportunities to differentiate our platform in the marketplace during the implementation of FINRA 15-02 related to Broker Dealer account statements and the U.S. Department of Labor's recent proposal on a fiduciary standard for retirement accounts.\nFollowing the NSAM Spin-off, our assets under management grew substantially in part because of the significant capital raising activity at NorthStar Realty. Recent volatility in the equity markets has diminished our NorthStar Listed Companies' capital raising activity and this environment could continue for an extended period of time.\nDue to our expertise and industry relationships, we continue to see a robust pipeline of investment opportunities that have credit qualities and yield profiles that are consistent with our underwriting standards and that we believe offer the opportunity to meet or exceed our Managed Companies targeted returns, thereby increasing our assets under management and fee income. We also believe the opportunity exists to accelerate our growth through accretive investments in third party asset managers. While we remain optimistic that we will continue to be able to generate and capitalize on an attractive pipeline of opportunities, there is no assurance that will be the case.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nVariable Interest Entities\nA variable interest entity, or VIE, is an entity that lacks one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity. A VIE is defined as an entity in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The determination of whether an entity is a VIE includes both a qualitative and quantitative analysis. We base the qualitative analysis on our review of the design of the entity, its organizational structure including decision-making ability and relevant financial agreements and the quantitative analysis on the forecasted cash flow of the entity.\nWe reassess the initial evaluation of an entity as a VIE upon the occurrence of certain reconsideration events.\nA VIE must be consolidated only by its primary beneficiary, which is defined as the party who, along with its affiliates and agents has both the: (i) power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance; and (ii) obligation to absorb the losses of the VIE or the right to receive the benefits from the VIE, which could be significant to the VIE. We determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE by considering qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to: which activities most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and which party controls such activities; the amount and characteristics of its investment; the obligation or likelihood for us or other interests to provide financial support; consideration of the VIE's purpose and design, including the risks the VIE was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders and the similarity with and significance to our business activities and the other interests. We reassess the determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE each reporting period. Significant judgments related to these determinations include estimates about the current and future fair value and performance of investments held by these VIEs and general market conditions.\nWe evaluate our Managed Companies, investments in unconsolidated ventures and securitization financing transactions to which we are the special servicer to determine whether they are a VIE. We analyze new investments and financings, as well as reconsideration events for existing investments and financings, which vary depending on type of investment or financing.\nVoting Interest Entities\nA voting interest entity is an entity in which the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable it to finance its activities independently and the equity holders have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance, the obligation to absorb the losses of the entity and the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The usual condition for a controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity is ownership of a majority voting interest. If we have a majority voting interest in a voting interest entity, the entity will generally be consolidated. We do not consolidate a voting interest entity if there are substantive participating rights by other parties and/or kick-out rights by a single party or through a simple majority vote.\nWe perform on-going reassessments of whether entities previously evaluated under the voting interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Ventures\nA non-controlling, unconsolidated ownership interest in an entity may be accounted for using the equity method, at fair value or the cost method.\nUnder the equity method, the investment is adjusted each period for capital contributions and distributions and its share of the entity's net income (loss). Capital contributions, distributions and net income (loss) of such entities are recorded in accordance with the terms of the governing documents. An allocation of net income (loss) may differ from the stated ownership percentage interest in such entity as a result of a preferred return and allocation formula, if any, as described in such governing documents.\nWe may account for an investment in an unconsolidated entity at fair value by electing the fair value option. We record the change in fair value for our share of the projected future cash flow of such investments from one period to another in equity in earnings (losses) from unconsolidated ventures in the consolidated statements of operations. Any change in fair value attributed to market related assumptions is considered unrealized gain (loss).\nWe may account for an investment that does not qualify for equity method accounting or for which the fair value option was not elected using the cost method if we determine the investment in the unconsolidated entity is insignificant. Under the cost method, equity in earnings is recorded as dividends are received to the extent they are not considered a return of capital, which is recorded as a reduction of cost of the investment.\nEstimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that could affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates and assumptions.\nSecurities\nWe elected to apply the fair value option for our securities investments. Any unrealized gain (loss) from the change in fair value is recorded in unrealized gains (losses) on investments and other in the consolidated statements of operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nAsset Management and Other Fees\nAsset management and other fees include asset management and other fees, such as acquisition and disposition fees, earned from our Managed Companies. Base asset management and other fees are recognized based on contractual terms specified in the underlying governing documents in the periods during which the related services are performed and the amounts have been contractually earned. Incentive fees and payments are recognized subject to the achievement of return hurdles in accordance with the respective terms set forth in the governing documents of our Managed Companies.\nSelling Commission and Dealer Manager Fees and Commission Expense\nSelling commission and dealer manager fees represent income earned by us for selling equity in our Sponsored Companies through NorthStar Securities. Selling commission and dealer manager fees and commission expense are accrued on a trade date basis.\nFair Value Measurement\nWe follow fair value guidance in accordance with U.S. GAAP to account for our financial instruments. We categorize our financial instruments, based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique, into a three-level fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).\nFinancial assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets and are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows:\n\n\n (a) Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets. \n (b) Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets. \n (c) Pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. \n (d) Pricing models whose inputs are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. \n Level 3. Prices or valuation techniques based on inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair  value measurement.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our recurring financial measurements recorded at fair value were our securities. Such securities are valued using quoted prices in an active market, and as such, is classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. As of December 31, 2014, we did not have any recurring financial measurements recorded at fair value.\nEquity-Based Compensation\nWe account for equity-based compensation awards, including awards granted to co-employees, using the fair value method, which requires an estimate of the fair value of the award. Awards may be based on a variety of measures such as time, performance, market or a combination thereof. For time-based awards, fair value is determined based on the stock price on the grant date. We recognize compensation expense over the vesting period on a straight-line basis or the attribution method depending if the grant is to an employee or non-employee. For performance-based awards, fair value is determined based on the stock price at the date of grant and an estimate of the probable achievement of such measure. We recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated attribution expense method. For market-based measures, fair value is determined using a Monte Carlo analysis under a risk-neutral premise using a risk-free interest rate. We recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis.\nFor awards with a combination of performance or market measures, we estimate the fair value as if it were two separate awards. First, we estimate the probability of achieving the performance measure. If it is not probable the performance condition will be met, we recognize the compensation expense based on the fair value of the market measure, as described above. This expense is recorded even if the market-based measure is never met. If the performance-based measure is subsequently estimated to be achieved, we record compensation expense based on the performance-based measure. We would then record a cumulative catch-up adjustment for any additional compensation expense.\nEquity-based compensation issued to non-employees is accounted for using the fair value of the award at the earlier of the performance commitment date or performance completion date. The awards are remeasured every quarter based on the stock price as of the end of the reporting period until such awards vest, if any.\nIncome Taxes\nCertain of our subsidiaries are subject to taxation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities for the periods presented. On March 13, 2015, we restructured forming our new operating partnership, or Operating Partnership, under Delaware law, by converting an existing limited liability company disregarded as separate from us for federal income tax purposes to a Delaware limited partnership and admitting as limited partners LTIP Unit Holders. The Operating Partnership is taxed as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and consequently, its items of income gain, loss, deduction and credit are passed through to, and included in, the taxable income of each of its partners including us. For the period prior to March 13, 2015, we and our U.S. subsidiaries will file consolidated federal income tax returns. Income taxes are accounted for by the asset/liability approach in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Deferred taxes, if any, represent the expected future tax consequences when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. Such amounts arise from differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax laws and tax rates in the period which such changes are enacted. A provision for income tax represents the total of income taxes paid or payable for the current period, plus the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an accounting update requiring a company to recognize as revenue the amount of consideration it expects to be entitled to in connection with the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The accounting standard update will replace most of the existing revenue recognition guidance currently promulgated by U.S. GAAP. In July 2015, the FASB decided to delay the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year. The effective date of the new revenue standard for us will be January 1, 2018. We are in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, of the update on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance that changes the rules regarding consolidation. The pronouncement eliminates specialized guidance for limited partnerships and similar legal entities and removes the indefinite deferral for certain investment funds. The new guidance is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt the new standard on January 1, 2016 and it is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued an accounting update changing the presentation of financing costs in financial statements. Under the new guidance, an entity would present these costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs would continue to be reported as interest expense. The new guidance is effective for annual periods and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. In the fourth quarter 2015,\nwe adopted this guidance and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance that eliminates the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. Under the new guidance, an acquirer will recognize a measurement-period adjustment during the period in which it determines the amount of the adjustment. The new guidance is effective for annual periods and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. We adopted this guidance in the third quarter 2015 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting update that addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently assessing the impact of the guidance on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting update that requires lessees to present right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The new guidance is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach at the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2014 (dollars in thousands):\nThe following table represents our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands):\nThe consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 represent our results of operations following the NSAM Spin-off on June 30, 2014. The year ended December 31, 2014 includes: (i) our results of operations for the six months ended December 31, 2014, which represents our activity following the NSAM Spin-off; and (ii) our results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2014, which represents a carve-out of its historical financial information including revenues and expenses attributable to us related to NorthStar Realty's historical asset management business. As a result, the year ended December 31, 2015 may not be comparable to the prior period presented.\n\nAsset Management and Other Fees\nAsset management and other fees are comprised of fees from our Managed Companies summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\n__________________\n (1) We began earning fees on July 1, 2014 with NorthStar Realty and November 1, 2015 with NorthStar Europe. \n (2) The increase was driven by the growth in assets of our Sponsored Companies. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, our Sponsored Companies held aggregate assets of $6.7 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively. \n (3) The increase was due to more investment activity of our Sponsored Companies in 2015 compared to 2014, with investment activity of $1.7 billion at NorthStar Healthcare and $997.0 million at NorthStar Income II. \n (4) The increase was driven by more repayments of debt investments from our Sponsored Companies in 2015 compared to 2014.  Selling Commission and Dealer Manager Fees\nWe earn net commission income through NorthStar Securities for selling equity in our Sponsored Companies.\nSelling commission and dealer manager fees represent fees earned for selling equity in our Sponsored Companies through NorthStar Securities. Our Sponsored Companies offer various share class structures which have a range of selling commissions and deal manager fees generally as follows:\n \u2022 Class A shares: selling commissions of up to 7% of gross offering proceeds raised and dealer manager fee of up to 3% of gross offering proceeds raised. \n \u2022 Class T shares: selling commissions of up to 2% of gross offering proceeds raised and dealer manager fee of up to 2.75% of gross offering proceeds raised.  A portion of the dealer manager fees may be reallowed to participating broker-dealers and paid to certain employees of NorthStar Securities. We are currently introducing additional share classes to our Sponsored Companies that will differ from the Class A and Class T shares describe above.\nSelling commission and dealer manager fees increased due to higher capital raising activity for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014.\nThe following table presents equity raised by our Sponsored Companies for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\n\n_________________\n (1) Includes capital raised through dividend reinvestment plans of $109.0 million and $59.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for which NorthStar Securities did not earn commission income. \n (2) NorthStar Income successfully completed its primary offering on July 1, 2013. Equity raised subsequent to the completion of the primary offering represents proceeds from NorthStar Income's dividend reinvestment plan. \n (3) NorthStar Healthcare successfully completed its follow-on public offering on January 19, 2016. \n (4) Capital raising pace at NorthStar Income II accelerated in 2015 compared to 2014. \n (5) In December 2015, NorthStar Realty and RXR Realty satisfied NorthStar/RXR New York Metro's minimum offering amount through the purchase of 0.2 million shares of NorthStar/RXR New York Metro common stock for $2 million in the aggregate. NorthStar/RXR New York Metro began raising capital in the beginning of 2016. \nOther Income\nOther income primarily represents special servicing fees related to certain securitization transactions at the corporate level. We are a rated special servicer by Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings and we receive special servicing fees for services related to certain securitization transactions. The increase is primarily the result of more services performed in 2015.\nExpenses\nCommission Expense\nCommission expense represents fees to participating broker-dealers with whom we have selling agreements to raise capital for our Sponsored Companies and commissions to employees of NorthStar Securities. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we paid $14.0 million and $7.8 million, respectively, to NorthStar Securities employees. Commission income and expense both increased due to higher capital raising activity for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense relates to our revolving credit agreement that we entered into in November 2015, in our corporate segment.\nTransaction Costs\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, transaction costs represent a one-time buyout in satisfaction of all participating interests related to NorthStar Income in our corporate segment and professional fees associated with the acquisition of our interest in Townsend in our direct investments segment. For the year ended December 31, 2014, transaction costs represents costs such as professional fees associated with the NSAM Spin-off in our corporate segment.\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses increased primarily due to the base management fees we pay to AHI for the year ended December 31, 2015 in our corporate segment. Such fees only began to be paid in December 2014.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses are principally incurred at the corporate level except as it relates to direct compensation expense and other costs incurred at our broker-dealer, which is part of our broker-dealer segment. In addition, the amount of general and administrative expenses reflects an offset from an allocation of costs of $10.3 million to our NorthStar Listed Companies and $36.6 million to our Sponsored Companies for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $52.6 million primarily attributable to the following:\nSalaries and related expense increased $31.1 million primarily due to most employees of NorthStar Realty becoming our employees upon the NSAM Spin-off as well as hiring additional employees for increased activity at our Managed Companies.\nEquity-based compensation expense is comprised of (dollars in thousands):\n\n__________________\n (1) Represents equity-based compensation expense for one-time grants issued related to the NSAM Spin-off. The increase in 2015 is due to a full year of expenses. Certain awards had performance-based conditions which were met upon issuance and accordingly, are included in time-based awards as they are only currently subject to continued employment conditions. \n (2) Represents equity-based compensation expense related to annual grants issued by NorthStar Realty prior to the NSAM Spin-off. The increase in 2015 is due to a full year of expenses. \n (3) The year ended December 31, 2014 includes an allocation of equity-based compensation expense prior to the NSAM Spin-off of $13.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014.  Other general and administrative expenses increased $15.7 million primarily due to the NSAM Spin-off as the prior period amount represented an allocation of other general and administrative expense related to NorthStar Realty's historical\nasset management business for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and increased costs related to occupancy and professional fees.\nUnrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments and Other\nUnrealized gain (loss) on investments and other is primarily related to the non-cash change in fair value for our investment in NorthStar Realty's common stock.\nEquity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated ventures\nThe following table presents equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated ventures for the year ended December 31, 2015 and for the period from the respective acquisition date to December 31, 2014 (dollars in thousands):\n\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense)\nSubsequent to the NSAM Spin-off, we became subject to both domestic and international income tax, as such, there was no income tax benefit (expense) for the six months ended June 30, 2014. The increase is primarily due to a one-time valuation allowance in 2014 and the distribution of earnings between tax jurisdictions in 2015 compared to 2014.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2013 (dollars in thousands):\nThe following table represents our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):\nThe consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 includes: (i) our results of operations for the six months ended December 31, 2014 which represents our activity following the NSAM Spin-off; and (ii) our results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2014, which represents a carve-out of its historical financial information including revenues and expenses attributable to us related to NorthStar Realty's historical asset management business. The consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013 was prepared on the same basis as the six months ended June 30, 2014. As a result, the year ended December 31, 2014 may not be comparable to the prior period presented.\n\nAsset Management and Other Fees\nAsset management and other fees are comprised of fees from our Managed Companies summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\n__________________\n (1) We began earning fees on July 1, 2014 with NorthStar Realty. \n (2) The increase was driven by the growth in assets of our Sponsored Companies. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, our Sponsored Companies held aggregate assets of $3.8 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. \n (3) The increase was due to more investment activity of our Sponsored Companies, significantly driven by $21.1 million earned from NorthStar Healthcare's real estate equity investments made in 2014. \n (4) The increase was driven by more repayments of debt investments from our Sponsored Companies in 2014 compared to 2013.  Selling Commission and Dealer Manager Fees\nWe earn net commission income through NorthStar Securities for selling equity in our Sponsored Companies.\nSelling commission and dealer manager fees represent fees earned for selling equity in our Sponsored Companies through NorthStar Securities. Pursuant to dealer manager agreements between NorthStar Securities and our Sponsored Companies, we generally receive selling commissions of up to 7% of gross offering proceeds raised, which we reallow to participating broker-dealers. In addition, we also generally receive a dealer manager fee of up to 3% of gross offering proceeds raised, a portion of which may be reallowed to participating broker-dealers and paid to certain employees of NorthStar Securities.\nSelling commission and dealer manager fees increased due to higher capital raising activity for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013.\nThe following table presents equity raised by our Sponsored Companies for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\n\n_________________\n (1) Includes capital raised through dividend reinvestment plans of $59.0 million and $33.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, for which NorthStar Securities did not earn commission income. \n (2) NorthStar Income successfully completed its primary offering on July 1, 2013. Equity raised subsequent to the completion of the primary offering represents proceeds from NorthStar Income's dividend reinvestment plan. \n (3) Capital raising pace at both NorthStar Healthcare and NorthStar Income II accelerated in 2014 compared to 2013.  Other Income\nOther income primarily represents special servicing fees related to certain securitization transactions at the corporate level. We are a rated special servicer by Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings and we receive special servicing fees for services related to certain securitization transactions. The increase is primarily the result of more services performed in 2014.\nExpenses\nCommission Expense\nCommission expense represents fees to participating broker-dealers with whom we have selling agreements to raise capital for our Sponsored Companies and commissions to employees of NorthStar Securities. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we paid $7.8 million and $5.4 million, respectively, to NorthStar Securities employees. Commission income and expense both increased due to higher capital raising activity for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013.\nTransaction Costs\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, transaction costs represent costs such as professional fees associated with the NSAM Spin-off in our corporate segment. The increase of $22.9 million is primarily due to the NSAM Spin-off in 2014.\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses primarily represents depreciation expense, legal and other expenses associated with our broker-dealer and special servicing businesses in our corporate segment.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses are principally incurred at the corporate level except as it relates to direct compensation expense and other costs incurred at our broker-dealer, which is part of our broker-dealer segment. In addition, the amount of general and administrative expenses reflects an offset from an allocation of costs of $5.2 million to NorthStar Realty and $24.0 million to our Sponsored Companies for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $73.7 million primarily attributable to the following:\nSalaries and related expense increased $15.9 million primarily due to most employees of NorthStar Realty becoming our employees upon the NSAM Spin-off as well as hiring additional employees for increased activity at our Managed Companies.\nEquity-based compensation expense is comprised of (dollars in thousands):\n\n__________________\n (1) Represents equity-based compensation expense for one-time grants issued related to the NSAM Spin-off. Certain awards had performance-based conditions which were met upon issuance and accordingly, are included in time-based awards as they are only currently subject to continued employment conditions. \n (2) Represents equity-based compensation expense related to annual grants issued by NorthStar Realty prior to the NSAM Spin-off. \n (3) The year ended December 31, 2014 includes an allocation of equity-based compensation expense prior to the NSAM Spin-off of $13.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014. The year ended December 31, 2013 represents an allocation of equity-based compensation expense prior to the NSAM Spin-off of $5.2 million.  Other general and administrative expenses increased $11.4 million primarily due to the NSAM Spin-off as the prior period amount represented an allocation of other general and administrative expense related to NorthStar Realty's historical asset management business.\nUnrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments and Other\nUnrealized gain (loss) on investments and other is primarily related to foreign currency remeasurement on cash.\nEquity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated ventures\nThe following table presents equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated ventures for the period from respective acquisition date to December 31, 2014 (dollars in thousands):\n\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense)\nSubsequent to the NSAM Spin-off, we became subject to both domestic and international income tax, and as such, there was no income tax benefit (expense) for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur capital sources may include cash flow provided from operating activities, primarily from management and other fee income paid to us from our Managed Companies, as well as borrowings and the issuance of common stock. In connection with the NSAM Spin-off, we have available under a revolving credit agreement with NorthStar Realty up to $250 million of financing to us subject to certain conditions (refer to Related Party Arrangements). In November 2015, in connection with the Townsend acquisition, we simultaneously obtained a commitment for a $500 million term loan and entered into a $100 million revolving credit agreement, both of which were used to fund the transaction and for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our common stock. Upon the closing of Townsend, we entered into the $500 million term loan and used the proceeds to repay the revolving credit agreement and for general corporate purposes. In connection with the term loan, we obtained corporate issuer and issue credit ratings from S&P and Moody's of BBB- and Ba2, respectively. Our primary uses of liquidity include operating expenses, dividends, acquisitions of direct investments and repurchase of our common stock. On a quarterly basis, our board of directors determines an appropriate common stock dividend based upon numerous factors, including CAD, availability of existing cash balances, general economic conditions and economic conditions that more specifically impact our business or prospects. Future dividend levels are subject to adjustment based upon our evaluation of the factors described above, as well as other factors that our board of directors may, from time-to-time, deem relevant to consider when determining an appropriate common stock dividend.\nIn addition, in April 2015, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $400 million of our outstanding common stock. The authorization expires in April 2016, unless otherwise extended by our board of directors. As of December 31, 2015, we repurchased 7.8 million shares of our common stock for $105 million, with $295 million remaining under the authorization.\nWe expect that our cash flow from operating activities and available financing will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2015, we had a receivable, related parties balance primarily from our Managed Companies of $94 million, of which we received $54 million subsequent to December 31, 2015.\nWe currently believe that our existing sources of funds should be adequate for purposes of meeting our short-term liquidity needs. Unrestricted cash as of February 23, 2016, was approximately $96 million, including $42 million in the United States and $54 million outside the United States.\nCash Flows\nThe following presents a summary of our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):\nThe consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2015 represent our cash flow following the NSAM Spin-off on June 30, 2014. The consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2014 includes: (i) our cash flow for the six months ended December 31, 2014, which represents our cash flow following the NSAM Spin-off; and (ii) our cash flow for the six months ended June 30, 2014, which represents a carve-out of our historical financial information including revenues and expenses attributable to us related to NorthStar Realty's historical asset management business. The consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2013 was prepared on the same basis as the six months ended June 30, 2014. As a result, the year ended December 31, 2015 may not be comparable to the prior periods.\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to December 31, 2014\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $158 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $47 million provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was due to fees beginning to be earned on July 1, 2014 from NorthStar Realty and an increase in asset management and other fees from our Sponsored Companies due to more investment activity. Year ended December 31, 2015 excludes $54 million of fees received subsequent to December 31, 2015.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $44 million used in investment activities for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was due to the acquisition of the Island Interest in 2015 and the purchase of shares of NorthStar Realty.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $109 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $99 million provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014. Cash flow used for the year ended December 31, 2015 was due to $105 million for the retirement of our shares, $78 million for the payment of dividends, $17 million for the call spread premium and $7 million for withholding tax related to vesting and net settlement of RSUs, offset by $100 million borrowed under the revolving credit agreement. Cash flow provided by for the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to our initial capitalization from NorthStar Realty.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to December 31, 2013\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $47 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $6 million used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily due to asset management and other fees from our Managed Companies and excludes $47 million of fees received subsequent to December 31, 2014, offset by an increase in operating expenses incurred to grow our business.\nNet cash used in investing activities represents investments in unconsolidated ventures, including the AHI Interest ($40 million) and Distribution Finance Interest ($4 million).\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $99 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Cash flow provided by for the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to the initial capital contribution upon the spin-off of $116 million which became effective on June 30, 2014 and an excess tax benefit of $2 million, offset by $19 million for the payment of dividends. Cash flow provided for the year ended December 31, 2013 was due to the NorthStar Realty contribution.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table presents contractual obligations and commitments as", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d and risk factors in Part I. Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d of this report. References to NSAM,\u201d we,\u201d us\u201d or our\u201d refer to NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context specifically requires otherwise.\nIntroduction\nWe are a global asset management firm focused on strategically managing real estate and other investment platforms in the United States and internationally. We commenced operations on July 1, 2014 upon the NSAM Spin-off. The NSAM Spin-off was in the form of a tax-free distribution to NorthStar Realty's common stockholders where each NorthStar Realty common stockholder received shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis. At the same time, NorthStar Realty became externally managed by our affiliate through a management contract with an initial term of 20 years. NorthStar Realty continues to operate its CRE debt origination business. Most of NorthStar Realty's employees at the time of the NSAM Spin-off became our employees.\nOn October 31, 2015, NorthStar Realty completed the previously announced NRE Spin-off into a separate publicly-traded REIT, NorthStar Europe. We manage NorthStar Europe pursuant to a long-term management agreement, on substantially similar terms as our management agreement with NorthStar Realty.\nWe are organized to provide asset management and other services to our Managed Companies, or any other companies we may sponsor in the future, both in the United States and internationally. Our Managed Companies have historically invested in the CRE industry. We seek to expand the scope of our asset management business beyond real estate into new asset classes and geographies by organically creating and managing additional investment vehicles or through acquisitions, strategic partnerships and joint ventures.\nWe earn asset management and other fees, directly or indirectly, pursuant to management and other contracts and direct investments. In addition, we own NorthStar Securities, a captive broker-dealer platform registered with the SEC which raises capital in the retail market for our Sponsored Companies.\nAs of December 31, 2015, adjusted for Townsend and sales, acquisitions and commitments to sell or acquire investments by our Managed Companies, we had $38 billion of assets under management. In addition, inception to date, we invested $100 million in direct investments in entities that manage $10 billion, including assets held by our Managed Companies, across a variety of asset classes. We may also make opportunistic investments that take advantage of market dynamics, such as our recent purchases of NorthStar Realty common stock.\nTownsend Acquisition\nOn January 29, 2016, we acquired an approximate 84% interest in Townsend, a leading global provider of investment management and advisory services focused on real assets. Founded in 1983, Townsend is the manager or advisor to approximately $184 billion of real assets. Townsend's management team owns the remainder of the business and continues to direct day-to-day operations. We acquired the interest in Townsend for approximately $383 million, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. In connection with the acquisition, we obtained a $500 million term loan, which was used to fund the transaction, repay in full the amount outstanding under our revolving credit agreement and for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our common stock.\nStrategic Opportunities\nIn January 2016, our board of directors announced that it had engaged Goldman Sachs to assist us in exploring strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value. There is no assurance that this exploration will result in any transaction being announced or consummated.\nSummary of Business\nOur primary business lines are as follows:\n \u2022 NorthStar Listed Companies - Provide asset management and other services on a fee basis by managing the day-to-day activities of our NorthStar Listed Companies. We began earning fees from NorthStar Realty on July 1, 2014 and NorthStar Europe on November 1, 2015. \n \u2022 Sponsored Companies - Provide asset management and other services on a fee basis by managing the day-to-day activities of our Sponsored Companies. \n \u2022 Broker-dealer - Raise capital in the retail market through NorthStar Securities and earn dealer manager fees from our Sponsored Companies. \n \u2022 Direct Investments - Invest in strategic partnerships and joint ventures with third-parties with expertise in commercial real estate or other sectors and markets, where we benefit from the fee stream and potential incentive fee or promote. \n \u2022 Corporate/other - Includes corporate level general and administrative expenses, as well as special servicing on a fee basis in connection with certain securitization transactions. In addition, includes opportunistic investments, such as our recent purchase of NorthStar Realty's common stock.  Sources of Operating Revenues and Cash Flows\nWe primarily generate revenue from asset management and other fee income pursuant to contractual arrangements with our Managed Companies. We also generate revenue from commission income from selling equity in our Sponsored Companies. Effective July 1, 2014, we began generating revenue from asset management and other fee income from NorthStar Realty in addition to our Sponsored Companies. Effective November 1, 2015, we began generating revenue from asset management and other fee income from NorthStar Europe. Additionally, we record equity in earnings and receive distributions from our unconsolidated ventures.\nProfitability and Performance Metrics\nWe calculate certain metrics to evaluate the profitability and performance of our business.\n \u2022 CAD is a non-GAAP measure that provides investors and management with a meaningful indicator of operating performance (refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measure\u201d for a description of this metric); and \n \u2022 Our ability to raise capital for our Managed Companies, which in turn grows the assets of our Managed Companies, is a driver of our ability to grow our fee income.  Outlook and Recent Trends\nAs an asset manager, we and the assets of our Managed Companies are impacted by general market and economic conditions. We have focused to date on strategically managing our real estate investments platform but we may determine to expand the breadth of our business. Historically, we have principally managed U.S. CRE assets and have more recently expanded internationally. Consequently, global markets and economic conditions will have an impact on our business.\nThe U.S. economy has improved, with the Federal Reserve raising the Federal Funds Rate for the first time in nine years in December 2015. Concerns remain regarding low inflation in the United States, a stronger U.S. dollar, slow global growth and international market volatility. Many other global central banks are easing monetary conditions to combat their low inflation and stagnant growth. Recently, concerns over global economic conditions, geopolitical issues, deflation, foreign exchange rates, the availability and cost of credit, the sovereign debt crisis, the Chinese economy, the U.S. mortgage market and a potentially weakening real estate market in the United States have contributed to increased economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy. These factors, combined with volatile prices of oil and declining business and consumer confidence, may precipitate an economic slowdown, as well as cause extreme volatility in security prices. The concern of a possible recession is resulting in uncertainty regarding the timing of the next Federal Reserve increase to the Federal Funds Rate.\nThe European economy continues to steadily recover. However, regional disparities continue to persist as economies recover at different speeds. We believe that the European Central Bank's recently expanded quantitative easing\u201d program, which the European Central Bank president has signaled could be further expanded if necessary, along with historically low interest rates, the depreciation of the euro and lower energy prices has nonetheless created a compelling long-term investment environment in Europe. As financial institutions continue to deleverage, we anticipate that there will be further opportunities to acquire portfolios and assets at an attractive long term basis.\nGiven market conditions at the end of 2015 and into 2016, our NorthStar Listed Companies are constrained by their inability to access the capital markets. CRE fundamentals remain relatively healthy across U.S. property types. Robust investor demand in 2014 for commercial real estate increased transaction activity and prices as rent and vacancy fundamentals improved across most property sectors and continued to improve in 2015, especially in the real estate private markets. However, property price appreciation has slowed and the markets may be in the later stage of the current real estate cycle and could lead to a recession.\nGlobal economic and political headwinds, along with global market instability and the risk that maturing commercial real estate debt may have difficulties being refinanced, among other factors, may continue to cause periodic volatility in the commercial real estate market for some time. It is currently estimated that approximately $1.4 trillion of commercial real estate debt in the United States will mature through 2018. While there appears to be a supply of available liquidity and improved fundamentals in the commercial real estate market, we still anticipate that certain of these loans will not be able to be refinanced, potentially inhibiting growth and contracting credit.\nAs an active asset manager in the retail capital raising industry, historically focusing on the non-traded sector, we are continually monitoring market fundamentals and trends. After showing resiliency during the economic downturn between 2007 and 2010, the non-traded REIT sector experienced strong growth over recent years peaking in 2013 with approximately $20 billion of equity being raised for programs in this space, largely influenced by high volume of liquidity events due to favorable capital markets conditions. Non-traded REIT capital raising was down 20% in 2014 (with approximately $16 billion dollars in equity sales) and\n2015 sales were down 36% compared to 2014. Despite this declining industry trend, our Sponsored Companies have continued to gain market share with our non-traded REITs having a 7% market share in 2014 and 13% market share in 2015. We expect to continue to gain market share in the non-traded REIT market as well as the overall retail market as our institutional-quality sponsorship, rapidly broadening product line and innovative structures create opportunities to differentiate our platform in the marketplace during the implementation of FINRA 15-02 related to Broker Dealer account statements and the U.S. Department of Labor's recent proposal on a fiduciary standard for retirement accounts.\nFollowing the NSAM Spin-off, our assets under management grew substantially in part because of the significant capital raising activity at NorthStar Realty. Recent volatility in the equity markets has diminished our NorthStar Listed Companies' capital raising activity and this environment could continue for an extended period of time.\nDue to our expertise and industry relationships, we continue to see a robust pipeline of investment opportunities that have credit qualities and yield profiles that are consistent with our underwriting standards and that we believe offer the opportunity to meet or exceed our Managed Companies targeted returns, thereby increasing our assets under management and fee income. We also believe the opportunity exists to accelerate our growth through accretive investments in third party asset managers. While we remain optimistic that we will continue to be able to generate and capitalize on an attractive pipeline of opportunities, there is no assurance that will be the case.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nVariable Interest Entities\nA variable interest entity, or VIE, is an entity that lacks one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity. A VIE is defined as an entity in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The determination of whether an entity is a VIE includes both a qualitative and quantitative analysis. We base the qualitative analysis on our review of the design of the entity, its organizational structure including decision-making ability and relevant financial agreements and the quantitative analysis on the forecasted cash flow of the entity.\nWe reassess the initial evaluation of an entity as a VIE upon the occurrence of certain reconsideration events.\nA VIE must be consolidated only by its primary beneficiary, which is defined as the party who, along with its affiliates and agents has both the: (i) power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance; and (ii) obligation to absorb the losses of the VIE or the right to receive the benefits from the VIE, which could be significant to the VIE. We determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE by considering qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to: which activities most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and which party controls such activities; the amount and characteristics of its investment; the obligation or likelihood for us or other interests to provide financial support; consideration of the VIE's purpose and design, including the risks the VIE was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders and the similarity with and significance to our business activities and the other interests. We reassess the determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE each reporting period. Significant judgments related to these determinations include estimates about the current and future fair value and performance of investments held by these VIEs and general market conditions.\nWe evaluate our Managed Companies, investments in unconsolidated ventures and securitization financing transactions to which we are the special servicer to determine whether they are a VIE. We analyze new investments and financings, as well as reconsideration events for existing investments and financings, which vary depending on type of investment or financing.\nVoting Interest Entities\nA voting interest entity is an entity in which the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable it to finance its activities independently and the equity holders have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance, the obligation to absorb the losses of the entity and the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The usual condition for a controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity is ownership of a majority voting interest. If we have a majority voting interest in a voting interest entity, the entity will generally be consolidated. We do not consolidate a voting interest entity if there are substantive participating rights by other parties and/or kick-out rights by a single party or through a simple majority vote.\nWe perform on-going reassessments of whether entities previously evaluated under the voting interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Ventures\nA non-controlling, unconsolidated ownership interest in an entity may be accounted for using the equity method, at fair value or the cost method.\nUnder the equity method, the investment is adjusted each period for capital contributions and distributions and its share of the entity's net income (loss). Capital contributions, distributions and net income (loss) of such entities are recorded in accordance with the terms of the governing documents. An allocation of net income (loss) may differ from the stated ownership percentage interest in such entity as a result of a preferred return and allocation formula, if any, as described in such governing documents.\nWe may account for an investment in an unconsolidated entity at fair value by electing the fair value option. We record the change in fair value for our share of the projected future cash flow of such investments from one period to another in equity in earnings (losses) from unconsolidated ventures in the consolidated statements of operations. Any change in fair value attributed to market related assumptions is considered unrealized gain (loss).\nWe may account for an investment that does not qualify for equity method accounting or for which the fair value option was not elected using the cost method if we determine the investment in the unconsolidated entity is insignificant. Under the cost method, equity in earnings is recorded as dividends are received to the extent they are not considered a return of capital, which is recorded as a reduction of cost of the investment.\nEstimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that could affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates and assumptions.\nSecurities\nWe elected to apply the fair value option for our securities investments. Any unrealized gain (loss) from the change in fair value is recorded in unrealized gains (losses) on investments and other in the consolidated statements of operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nAsset Management and Other Fees\nAsset management and other fees include asset management and other fees, such as acquisition and disposition fees, earned from our Managed Companies. Base asset management and other fees are recognized based on contractual terms specified in the underlying governing documents in the periods during which the related services are performed and the amounts have been contractually earned. Incentive fees and payments are recognized subject to the achievement of return hurdles in accordance with the respective terms set forth in the governing documents of our Managed Companies.\nSelling Commission and Dealer Manager Fees and Commission Expense\nSelling commission and dealer manager fees represent income earned by us for selling equity in our Sponsored Companies through NorthStar Securities. Selling commission and dealer manager fees and commission expense are accrued on a trade date basis.\nFair Value Measurement\nWe follow fair value guidance in accordance with U.S. GAAP to account for our financial instruments. We categorize our financial instruments, based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique, into a three-level fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).\nFinancial assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets and are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows:\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level 1.\n</td> <td>Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level 2.\n</td> <td>Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on the following:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets. \n (b) Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets. \n (c) Pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. \n (d) Pricing models whose inputs are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. \n Level 3. Prices or valuation techniques based on inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair  value measurement.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our recurring financial measurements recorded at fair value were our securities. Such securities are valued using quoted prices in an active market, and as such, is classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. As of December 31, 2014, we did not have any recurring financial measurements recorded at fair value.\nEquity-Based Compensation\nWe account for equity-based compensation awards, including awards granted to co-employees, using the fair value method, which requires an estimate of the fair value of the award. Awards may be based on a variety of measures such as time, performance, market or a combination thereof. For time-based awards, fair value is determined based on the stock price on the grant date. We recognize compensation expense over the vesting period on a straight-line basis or the attribution method depending if the grant is to an employee or non-employee. For performance-based awards, fair value is determined based on the stock price at the date of grant and an estimate of the probable achievement of such measure. We recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated attribution expense method. For market-based measures, fair value is determined using a Monte Carlo analysis under a risk-neutral premise using a risk-free interest rate. We recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis.\nFor awards with a combination of performance or market measures, we estimate the fair value as if it were two separate awards. First, we estimate the probability of achieving the performance measure. If it is not probable the performance condition will be met, we recognize the compensation expense based on the fair value of the market measure, as described above. This expense is recorded even if the market-based measure is never met. If the performance-based measure is subsequently estimated to be achieved, we record compensation expense based on the performance-based measure. We would then record a cumulative catch-up adjustment for any additional compensation expense.\nEquity-based compensation issued to non-employees is accounted for using the fair value of the award at the earlier of the performance commitment date or performance completion date. The awards are remeasured every quarter based on the stock price as of the end of the reporting period until such awards vest, if any.\nIncome Taxes\nCertain of our subsidiaries are subject to taxation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities for the periods presented. On March 13, 2015, we restructured forming our new operating partnership, or Operating Partnership, under Delaware law, by converting an existing limited liability company disregarded as separate from us for federal income tax purposes to a Delaware limited partnership and admitting as limited partners LTIP Unit Holders. The Operating Partnership is taxed as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and consequently, its items of income gain, loss, deduction and credit are passed through to, and included in, the taxable income of each of its partners including us. For the period prior to March 13, 2015, we and our U.S. subsidiaries will file consolidated federal income tax returns. Income taxes are accounted for by the asset/liability approach in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Deferred taxes, if any, represent the expected future tax consequences when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. Such amounts arise from differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax laws and tax rates in the period which such changes are enacted. A provision for income tax represents the total of income taxes paid or payable for the current period, plus the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an accounting update requiring a company to recognize as revenue the amount of consideration it expects to be entitled to in connection with the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The accounting standard update will replace most of the existing revenue recognition guidance currently promulgated by U.S. GAAP. In July 2015, the FASB decided to delay the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year. The effective date of the new revenue standard for us will be January 1, 2018. We are in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, of the update on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance that changes the rules regarding consolidation. The pronouncement eliminates specialized guidance for limited partnerships and similar legal entities and removes the indefinite deferral for certain investment funds. The new guidance is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt the new standard on January 1, 2016 and it is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued an accounting update changing the presentation of financing costs in financial statements. Under the new guidance, an entity would present these costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs would continue to be reported as interest expense. The new guidance is effective for annual periods and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. In the fourth quarter 2015,\nwe adopted this guidance and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance that eliminates the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. Under the new guidance, an acquirer will recognize a measurement-period adjustment during the period in which it determines the amount of the adjustment. The new guidance is effective for annual periods and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. We adopted this guidance in the third quarter 2015 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting update that addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently assessing the impact of the guidance on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting update that requires lessees to present right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The new guidance is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach at the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2014 (dollars in thousands):\nThe following table represents our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands):\nThe consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 represent our results of operations following the NSAM Spin-off on June 30, 2014. The year ended December 31, 2014 includes: (i) our results of operations for the six months ended December 31, 2014, which represents our activity following the NSAM Spin-off; and (ii) our results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2014, which represents a carve-out of its historical financial information including revenues and expenses attributable to us related to NorthStar Realty's historical asset management business. As a result, the year ended December 31, 2015 may not be comparable to the prior period presented.\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

by the growth in assets of our Sponsored Companies. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, our Sponsored Companies held aggregate assets of $6.7 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively. \n (3) The increase was due to more investment activity of our Sponsored Companies in 2015 compared to 2014, with investment activity of $1.7 billion at NorthStar Healthcare and $997.0 million at NorthStar Income II. \n (4) The increase was driven by more repayments of debt investments from our Sponsored Companies in 2015 compared to 2014.  Selling Commission and Dealer Manager Fees\nWe earn net commission income through NorthStar Securities for selling equity in our Sponsored Companies.\nSelling commission and dealer manager fees represent fees earned for selling equity in our Sponsored Companies through NorthStar Securities. Our Sponsored Companies offer various share class structures which have a range of selling commissions and deal manager fees generally as follows:\n \u2022 Class A shares: selling commissions of up to 7% of gross offering proceeds raised and dealer manager fee of up to 3% of gross offering proceeds raised. \n \u2022 Class T shares: selling commissions of up to 2% of gross offering proceeds raised and dealer manager fee of up to 2.75% of gross offering proceeds raised.  A portion of the dealer manager fees may be reallowed to participating broker-dealers and paid to certain employees of NorthStar Securities. We are currently introducing additional share classes to our Sponsored Companies that will differ from the Class A and Class T shares describe above.\nSelling commission and dealer manager fees increased due to higher capital raising activity for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014.\nThe following table presents equity raised by our Sponsored Companies for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\nTable 226: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NorthStar Income(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,783\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NorthStar Healthcare\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>824,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>867,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NorthStar Income II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>553,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>280,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NorthStar/RXR New York Metro\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,423,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,190,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________\n (1) Includes capital raised through dividend reinvestment plans of $109.0 million and $59.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for which NorthStar Securities did not earn commission income. \n (2) NorthStar Income successfully completed its primary offering on July 1, 2013. Equity raised subsequent to the completion of the primary offering represents proceeds from NorthStar Income's dividend reinvestment plan. \n (3) NorthStar Healthcare successfully completed its follow-on public offering on January 19, 2016. \n (4) Capital raising pace at NorthStar Income II accelerated in 2015 compared to 2014. \n (5) In December 2015, NorthStar Realty and RXR Realty satisfied NorthStar/RXR New York Metro's minimum offering amount through the purchase of 0.2 million shares of NorthStar/RXR New York Metro common stock for $2 million in the aggregate. NorthStar/RXR New York Metro began raising capital in the beginning of 2016. \nOther Income\nOther income primarily represents special servicing fees related to certain securitization transactions at the corporate level. We are a rated special servicer by Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings and we receive special servicing fees for services related to certain securitization transactions. The increase is primarily the result of more services performed in 2015.\nExpenses\nCommission Expense\nCommission expense represents fees to participating broker-dealers with whom we have selling agreements to raise capital for our Sponsored Companies and commissions to employees of NorthStar Securities. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we paid $14.0 million and $7.8 million, respectively, to NorthStar Securities employees. Commission income and expense both increased due to higher capital raising activity for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense relates to our revolving credit agreement that we entered into in November 2015, in our corporate segment.\nTransaction Costs\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, transaction costs represent a one-time buyout in satisfaction of all participating interests related to NorthStar Income in our corporate segment and professional fees associated with the acquisition of our interest in Townsend in our direct investments segment. For the year ended December 31, 2014, transaction costs represents costs such as professional fees associated with the NSAM Spin-off in our corporate segment.\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses increased primarily due to the base management fees we pay to AHI for the year ended December 31, 2015 in our corporate segment. Such fees only began to be paid in December 2014.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses are principally incurred at the corporate level except as it relates to direct compensation expense and other costs incurred at our broker-dealer, which is part of our broker-dealer segment. In addition, the amount of general and administrative expenses reflects an offset from an allocation of costs of $10.3 million to our NorthStar Listed Companies and $36.6 million to our Sponsored Companies for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $52.6 million primarily attributable to the following:\nSalaries and related expense increased $31.1 million primarily due to most employees of NorthStar Realty becoming our employees upon the NSAM Spin-off as well as hiring additional employees for increased activity at our Managed Companies.\nEquity-based compensation expense is comprised of (dollars in thousands):\nTable 232: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Time-Based Awards\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Performance-Based Awards\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NSAM spin grants(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NSAM bonus plan\n</td> <td>9,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NorthStar Realty bonus plan(2)\n</td> <td>9,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Grants to non-employees\n</td> <td>1,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________\n (1) Represents equity-based compensation expense for one-time grants issued related to the NSAM Spin-off.

As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, our Sponsored Companies held aggregate assets of $3.8 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. \n (3) The increase was due to more investment activity of our Sponsored Companies, significantly driven by $21.1 million earned from NorthStar Healthcare's real estate equity investments made in 2014. \n (4) The increase was driven by more repayments of debt investments from our Sponsored Companies in 2014 compared to 2013.  Selling Commission and Dealer Manager Fees\nWe earn net commission income through NorthStar Securities for selling equity in our Sponsored Companies.\nSelling commission and dealer manager fees represent fees earned for selling equity in our Sponsored Companies through NorthStar Securities. Pursuant to dealer manager agreements between NorthStar Securities and our Sponsored Companies, we generally receive selling commissions of up to 7% of gross offering proceeds raised, which we reallow to participating broker-dealers. In addition, we also generally receive a dealer manager fee of up to 3% of gross offering proceeds raised, a portion of which may be reallowed to participating broker-dealers and paid to certain employees of NorthStar Securities.\nSelling commission and dealer manager fees increased due to higher capital raising activity for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013.\nThe following table presents equity raised by our Sponsored Companies for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\nTable 243: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NorthStar Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>545,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NorthStar Healthcare\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>867,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NorthStar Income II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>280,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,190,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>682,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________\n (1) Includes capital raised through dividend reinvestment plans of $59.0 million and $33.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, for which NorthStar Securities did not earn commission income. \n (2) NorthStar Income successfully completed its primary offering on July 1, 2013. Equity raised subsequent to the completion of the primary offering represents proceeds from NorthStar Income's dividend reinvestment plan. \n (3) Capital raising pace at both NorthStar Healthcare and NorthStar Income II accelerated in 2014 compared to 2013.  Other Income\nOther income primarily represents special servicing fees related to certain securitization transactions at the corporate level. We are a rated special servicer by Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings and we receive special servicing fees for services related to certain securitization transactions. The increase is primarily the result of more services performed in 2014.\nExpenses\nCommission Expense\nCommission expense represents fees to participating broker-dealers with whom we have selling agreements to raise capital for our Sponsored Companies and commissions to employees of NorthStar Securities. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we paid $7.8 million and $5.4 million, respectively, to NorthStar Securities employees. Commission income and expense both increased due to higher capital raising activity for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013.\nTransaction Costs\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, transaction costs represent costs such as professional fees associated with the NSAM Spin-off in our corporate segment. The increase of $22.9 million is primarily due to the NSAM Spin-off in 2014.\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses primarily represents depreciation expense, legal and other expenses associated with our broker-dealer and special servicing businesses in our corporate segment.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses are principally incurred at the corporate level except as it relates to direct compensation expense and other costs incurred at our broker-dealer, which is part of our broker-dealer segment. In addition, the amount of general and administrative expenses reflects an offset from an allocation of costs of $5.2 million to NorthStar Realty and $24.0 million to our Sponsored Companies for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $73.7 million primarily attributable to the following:\nSalaries and related expense increased $15.9 million primarily due to most employees of NorthStar Realty becoming our employees upon the NSAM Spin-off as well as hiring additional employees for increased activity at our Managed Companies.\nEquity-based compensation expense is comprised of (dollars in thousands):\nTable 247: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Time-Based Awards\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Performance-Based Awards\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NSAM spin grants(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NSAM bonus plan\n</td> <td>4,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NorthStar Realty bonus plan(2)\n</td> <td>13,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> <td>3,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> <td>5,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Grants to non-employees\n</td> <td>124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________\n (1) Represents equity-based compensation expense for one-time grants issued related to the NSAM Spin-off.

In connection with the NSAM Spin-off, we have available under a revolving credit agreement with NorthStar Realty up to $250 million of financing to us subject to certain conditions (refer to Related Party Arrangements). In November 2015, in connection with the Townsend acquisition, we simultaneously obtained a commitment for a $500 million term loan and entered into a $100 million revolving credit agreement, both of which were used to fund the transaction and for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our common stock. Upon the closing of Townsend, we entered into the $500 million term loan and used the proceeds to repay the revolving credit agreement and for general corporate purposes. In connection with the term loan, we obtained corporate issuer and issue credit ratings from S&P and Moody's of BBB- and Ba2, respectively. Our primary uses of liquidity include operating expenses, dividends, acquisitions of direct investments and repurchase of our common stock. On a quarterly basis, our board of directors determines an appropriate common stock dividend based upon numerous factors, including CAD, availability of existing cash balances, general economic conditions and economic conditions that more specifically impact our business or prospects. Future dividend levels are subject to adjustment based upon our evaluation of the factors described above, as well as other factors that our board of directors may, from time-to-time, deem relevant to consider when determining an appropriate common stock dividend.\nIn addition, in April 2015, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $400 million of our outstanding common stock. The authorization expires in April 2016, unless otherwise extended by our board of directors. As of December 31, 2015, we repurchased 7.8 million shares of our common stock for $105 million, with $295 million remaining under the authorization.\nWe expect that our cash flow from operating activities and available financing will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2015, we had a receivable, related parties balance primarily from our Managed Companies of $94 million, of which we received $54 million subsequent to December 31, 2015.\nWe currently believe that our existing sources of funds should be adequate for purposes of meeting our short-term liquidity needs. Unrestricted cash as of February 23, 2016, was approximately $96 million, including $42 million in the United States and $54 million outside the United States.\nCash Flows\nThe following presents a summary of our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):\nThe consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2015 represent our cash flow following the NSAM Spin-off on June 30, 2014. The consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2014 includes: (i) our cash flow for the six months ended December 31, 2014, which represents our cash flow following the NSAM Spin-off; and (ii) our cash flow for the six months ended June 30, 2014, which represents a carve-out of our historical financial information including revenues and expenses attributable to us related to NorthStar Realty's historical asset management business. The consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2013 was prepared on the same basis as the six months ended June 30, 2014. As a result, the year ended December 31, 2015 may not be comparable to the prior periods.\nTable 252: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>158,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,363\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(72,639\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(43,582\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(109,442\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(529\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(410\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(24,492\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>894\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to December 31, 2014\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $158 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $47 million provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014.
