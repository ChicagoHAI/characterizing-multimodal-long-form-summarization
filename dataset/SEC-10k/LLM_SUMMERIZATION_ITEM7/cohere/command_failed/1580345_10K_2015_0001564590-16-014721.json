Important assumptions include our ability to originate new loans and investments, certain margins and levels of profitability and the availability of additional capital. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this annual report on Form 10-K should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. These risks and uncertainties include those described in Risk Factors\u201d in this annual report on Form 10-K under Part 1A. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ending December 31, 2014.\nOur shares are currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE\u201d) under the symbol TPVG\u201d. Our 6.75% Notes due 2020 (the \"2020 Notes\") are currently listed on the NYSE under the symbol TPVZ\u201d.\nOur investment objective is to maximize our total return to stockholders primarily in the form of current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation by primarily lending with warrants to venture growth stage companies focused in technology, life sciences and other high growth industries which are backed by TPC's select group of leading venture capital investors.\nWe were formed to expand the venture growth stage business segment of TPC's global investment platform and are the primary vehicle through which TPC focuses its venture growth stage business. TPC is widely recognized as a leading global financing provider devoted to serving venture capital-backed companies with creative, flexible and customized debt financing, equity capital and complementary services throughout their lifespan. TPC is located on Sand Hill Road in Silicon Valley and has a primary focus in technology, life sciences and other high growth industries.\nWe commenced investment activities on March 5, 2014. In order to expedite the ramp-up of our investment activities and further our ability to meet our investment objectives, on March 5, 2014, we acquired our initial portfolio. The net consideration paid was approximately $121.7 million which reflected approximately $123.7 million of investments less approximately $2.0 million of prepaid interest and the fair value of unfunded commitments. We financed the acquisition of our initial portfolio by using a portion of a $200.0 million credit facility (the Bridge Facility\u201d) provided by Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch ( Deutsche Bank\u201d). On March 11, 2014, we completed our initial public offering and sold 9,840,665 shares of common stock (including 1,250,000 shares of common stock through the underwriters' exercise of their overallotment option and the concurrent private placement of 257,332 shares of common stock to our Adviser's senior team and other persons associated with TPC) of our common stock at an offering price of $15.00 per share. We received $141.6 million of net proceeds in connection with the initial public offering and concurrent private placement, net of the portion of the underwriting sales load and offering costs we paid. We used a portion of these net proceeds to pay down all amounts outstanding under the Bridge Facility and terminated the Bridge Facility in conjunction with such repayment.\nIn February 2014, we entered into a credit agreement with Deutsche Bank acting as administrative agent and a lender, and KeyBank National Association, Everbank Commercial Lender Finance, Inc., and AloStar Bank of Commerce, as other lenders, which provided us with a $150.0 million commitment, subject to borrowing base\nrequirements ( Credit Facility\u201d). In August 2014, we amended the Credit Facility to increase the total commitments by $50.0 million to $200.0 million in aggregate. Effective as of a January 2016 amendment to the Credit Facility, borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at the sum of (i) the commercial paper rate for certain specified lenders and 30-day LIBOR for other lenders or, if LIBOR is unavailable, the higher of Deutsche Bank's commercial lending rate or the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50% plus (ii) a margin of 3.0% during the Credit Facility's revolving period. The revolving period under the amended Credit Facility expires in February 2018.\nOn March 27, 2015, we priced a public offering of 6,500,000 shares of our common stock, raising approximately $93.7 million after offering costs. On April 29, 2015, we received an additional approximately $2.2 million through the issuance of 154,018 shares of our common stock as the result of the underwriters' partial exercise of their overallotment option.\nOn August 4, 2015, we completed a public offering of $50.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2020 Notes and received net proceeds of $48.3 million after the payment of fees and offering costs. The interest on the 2020 Notes is payable quarterly on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15, beginning on October 15, 2015. On September 2, 2015, we issued an additional $4.6 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2020 Notes and received net proceeds of approximately $4.5 million, after the payment of the underwriting sales load and offering costs, as a result of the underwriters' partial exercise of their option to purchase additional 2020 Notes.\nPortfolio Composition, Investment Activity and Asset Quality\nPortfolio Composition\nWe originate and invest primarily in venture growth stage companies. Companies at the venture growth stage have distinct characteristics differentiating them from venture capital-backed companies at other stages in their development lifecycle. We invest primarily in (i) growth capital loans that have a secured collateral position and that are used by venture growth stage companies to finance their continued expansion and growth, (ii) equipment financings, which may be structured as loans or leases, that have a secured collateral position on specified mission-critical equipment, (iii) on a select basis, revolving loans that have a secured collateral position and that are used by venture growth stage companies to advance against inventory, components, accounts receivable, contractual or future billings, bookings, revenues, sales or cash payments and collections including proceeds from a sale, financing or the equivalent and (iv) direct equity investments in venture growth stage companies. In connection with our growth capital loans, equipment financings and revolving loans, we generally receive warrants that allow us to participate in any equity appreciation of our borrowers and enhance our overall investment returns.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had 85 investments in 34 companies and our four largest portfolio companies represented approximately 43.7% of our portfolio investments. Our investments included 47 debt investments, 31 warrant investments, and seven direct equity investments. The total cost and fair value of these investments were approximately $276.4 million and approximately $271.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, two of our customers were publicly traded. At December 31, 2015, the 47 debt investments with an aggregate fair value of approximately $259.6 million had a weighted average loan to enterprise value at the time of underwriting ratio of approximately 19.2%. Enterprise value of the borrower is estimated based on information available, including any information regarding the most recent rounds of borrower funding. Excluding the debt investment to Intermodal Data, Inc. (due to its foreclosure agreement to purchase certain assets and assume the outstanding obligations - see further discussion in Asset Quality\u201d section), the weighted average loan to enterprise value at the time of underwriting ratio was approximately 8.6%.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had 76 investments in 27 companies. Our investments included 46 debt investments, 26 warrant investments, and four direct equity investments. The total cost and fair value of these investments were approximately $256.5 million and approximately $258.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, one of our customers was publicly traded. At December 31, 2014, the 46 debt investments with an aggregate fair value of approximately $247.6 million had a weighted average loan to enterprise value at the time of underwriting ratio of approximately 9.1%.\nThe following tables provide information on the cost, fair value, and net unrealized gains (losses) of our investments in companies along with the number of companies in our portfolio as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nTable 279: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investments by Type\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Unrealized\n(Losses) Gains\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Number of\nInvestments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Number of\nCompanies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 265,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 259,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5,721\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Warrants\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Investments in Portfolio Companies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 276,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 271,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (4,635\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 280: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investments by Type\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Unrealized\nGains\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Number of\nInvestments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Number of\nCompanies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 247,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 247,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Warrants\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Investments in Portfolio Companies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 256,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 257,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 281: <table> <tr> <td> *\n</td> <td> Represents non-duplicative number of companies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following tables show the fair value of the portfolio of investments, by industry and the percentage of the total investment portfolio, as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nTable 282: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investments in Portfolio Companies by Industry\n(dollars in thousands)\u200d\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> At Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage of Total\nInvestments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Database Software\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 42,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> E-Commerce -

During the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014, we entered into fifteen new commitments with eleven new customers and four existing customers totaling $269.5 million, we funded 32 debt investments for approximately $159.4 million in principal balance, acquired warrants representing approximately $3.5 million of value, and made two equity investments totaling approximately $0.5 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we had prepayments from six of our portfolio companies for approximately $73.4 million in principal value. During the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014, we had prepayments from two of our portfolio companies for approximately $27.7 million in principal value.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our unfunded commitments to twelve companies totaled approximately $190.0 million; as of December 31, 2014, our unfunded commitments to eleven companies totaled $211.0 million.

Since these commitments may expire without being drawn upon, unfunded commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements or future earning assets for the Company. We generally expect approximately 75% of our gross unfunded commitments to eventually be drawn before the expiration of their corresponding availability periods.\nThe fair value at the inception of the agreement of the delay draw credit agreements with our customers is equal to the fees and/or warrants received to enter into these agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties' credit profile. The unfunded commitment liability reflects the fair value of these future funding commitments. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the fair value for these unfunded commitments totaled approximately $1.1 million and $2.1 million, respectively, and was included in other accrued expenses and liabilities\u201d in our consolidated statements of assets and liabilities.\nOur level of investment activity can vary substantially from period to period as our Adviser chooses to slow or accelerate new business originations depending on market conditions, rate of investment of TPC's select group of leading venture capital investors, our Adviser's knowledge, expertise and experience, our funding capacity\n(including availability under our credit facilities and our ability or inability to raise equity or debt capital), and other market dynamics.\nThe following table shows the debt commitments, fundings of debt investments (principal balance) and equity investments and non-binding term sheet activity for the year ended December 31, 2015 and for the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014.\nTable 288: <table> <tr> <td> Commitments and Fundings\nSince Acquisition of Initial Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Period From\nMarch 5, 2014\n(Commencement of\nOperations) to\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt Commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> New customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 144,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 232,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Existing customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Previous customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 213,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 269,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Funded Debt Investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 101,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 159,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity Investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-Binding Term Sheets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 427,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 445,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn December 31, 2015, we acquired $70.0 million in U.S. Treasury bills which were subsequently sold on January 5, 2016.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, there were five changes within the credit categories. One borrower with a principal balance of $5.0 million was upgraded from White (2) to Clear (1). One borrower with a principal balance of $6.9 million was downgraded from White (2) to Yellow (3). Two borrowers, Virtual Instruments Corporation with principal balance of $25.6 million and Mind Candy Limited with principal balance of $10.0 million, were downgraded from Yellow (3) to Orange (4). The other downgrade included the debt investments that were initially to Coraid, Inc., which were assumed by Intermodal Data, Inc. as part of the foreclosure agreement it entered into to purchase certain assets and assume the outstanding obligations owed to us. The debt investment to Intermodal Data, Inc. was ranked as Orange (4) as of December 31, 2015.\nDuring the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014, there were four changes within the credit categories.

Net investment income (loss) is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees and other investment income and our operating expenses including interest on borrowed funds. Net realized gains (losses) on investments are the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their amortized cost. Net unrealized gains (losses) on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio.\nSince we commenced operations on March 5, 2014, the results of operations for the period ended December 31, 2014 represents only 302 days of operations, as compared to 365 days for the year ended December 31, 2015, which accounts for most of the differences in operating results over these two periods.\nAs summarized in the table below, for the year ended December 31, 2015, our net increase in net assets resulting from operations was approximately $15.5 million, which was comprised of approximately $21.9 million of net investment income, partially offset by approximately $0.3 million of net realized losses and approximately $6.1 million of net change in unrealized losses. On a per share basis, net investment income was $1.46 per share and the net increase in net assets from operations was $1.03 per share. Our core net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately $21.6 million, or $1.44 per share. For the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014, our net increase in net assets resulting from operations was approximately $14.3 million, consisting of approximately $12.8 million in net investment income and approximately $1.5 million of net change in unrealized gains on investments. On a per share basis, net investment income was $1.30 per share and the net change in net assets from operations was $1.45 per share. Our core net investment income for the same period was approximately $13.1 million, or $1.33 per share.\nOur investment and other income increased by $16.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014 primarily due to the increase in average portfolio balance and higher prepayment activity in 2015. The year-over-year fluctuations were also due to the lower number of days of operations in 2014. Operating expenses also increased by $7.6 million during the same period for the following reasons: higher base management and incentive fees of $3.9 million due to higher asset balance and higher returns, higher interest expense of $2.4 million due to higher outstanding average balances and issuance of 2020 Notes in the third quarter of 2015, increase in general and administrative expenses of $0.9 million and administration agreement expenses of $0.4 million primarily due to the difference in number of days of operations in 2014. Net investment income and core net investment income increased during the same period for the reasons noted above.\nNet realized losses were approximately $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the losses on warrants of one portfolio company. There were no realized gains or losses during any period in 2014. Net change in unrealized losses during the year ended December 31, 2015, were $6.1 million as compared to a net change in unrealized gains of $1.5 million during the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to\nDecember 31, 2014. These have been discussed in more detail in the tables below.

Core net investment income, unlike GAAP net investment income, excludes accrued, but as yet unearned, capital gains incentive fee. We believe an important measure of the investment income that we will be required to distribute each year is core net investment income as capital gains incentive fee is accrued based on unrealized gains but are not earned until realized gains occur. Specifically, the capital gains component of the incentive fee is paid at the end of each calendar year and is 20.0% of our aggregate cumulative realized capital gains from commencement of operations through the end of the year, computed net of our aggregate cumulative realized capital losses and our aggregate cumulative unrealized losses through the end of such year. For the foregoing purpose, our aggregate cumulative realized capital gains\u201d does not include any unrealized gains. The capital gains component of the incentive fee is not subject to any minimum return to stockholders. For the year ended December 31, 2015 and the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014, no net capital gains were realized and thus no capital gains incentive fee was earned and was payable. During the same periods, we reported approximately $6.1 million in net change in unrealized losses and approximately $1.5 million in net change in unrealized gains, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015 we reversed previously accrued capital gains incentive fee of approximately $0.3 million. For the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014, we accrued approximately $0.3 million in capital gains incentive fee.\nTable 293: <table> <tr> <td> Net Investment Income and Core Net Investment Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Period from March 5, 2014 (Commencement of Operations) to\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Investment Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital gains incentive fee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (296\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Core Net Investment Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Investment Income per Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital gains incentive fee per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.02\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.03\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Core Net Investment Income per Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.33\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment income includes interest income on our debt investments utilizing the effective yield method and includes cash interest income as well as the amortization of purchase premium, accretion of purchase discount, original issue discount, facilities fees, and the amortization and payment of the end-of-term ( EOT\u201d) payments. For the year ended December 31, 2015 and for the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014, investment income totaled approximately $39.9 million and $24.7 million, respectively, representing a weighted average portfolio yield of approximately 17.0% and 15.4%, respectively, on debt investments for the periods held.\nWe calculate weighted average portfolio yields for periods shown as the annualized rates of the interest income recognized during the period divided by the average amortized cost of debt investments in the portfolio at the beginning of each month in the period. The weighted average yields reported for these periods are annualized and reflect the weighted average yields to maturities. Should the portfolio companies choose to repay their loans earlier, our weighted average yields will increase for those debt investments affected but may reduce our weighted average yields on the remaining portfolio in future quarters. As our portfolio grows and seasons, we expect our loans to be outstanding for shorter periods than to maturity and to reflect healthy prepayment activity.\nThe following table provides the weighted average portfolio yield on our portfolio comprising of cash interest income, accretion of the net purchase discount, facilities fees and the value of warrants received, accretion of EOT payments and the accelerated receipt of EOT payments on prepayments.\nTable 294: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Period from March 5, 2014 (Commencement of Operations) to\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Portfolio Yield (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average portfolio yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Coupon income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accretion of discount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accretion of end-of-term payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impact of prepayments during the\nperiod\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 295: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> The yields for periods shown are the annualized rates of interest income or the components of interest income recognized during the period divided by the average amortized cost of debt investments in the portfolio at the beginning of each month in the period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe yield on our portfolio, excluding the impact of prepayments was approximately 15.4% and 14.5%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015 and for the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of\noperations) to December 31, 2014. The yields on our portfolio are dependent on fundings and the performance of our loans including prepayments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized approximately $2.2 million in other income consisting of approximately $1.8 million due to the termination or expiration of unfunded commitments and approximately $0.4 million from the realization of certain fees paid by companies and miscellaneous income. For the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014, we recognized approximately $0.7 million in other income consisting of approximately $0.4 million due to the termination or expiration of unfunded commitments and approximately $0.3 million from the realization of certain fees paid by companies and miscellaneous income.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, total operating expenses were approximately $20.1 million, comprising of approximately $9.5 million in base management and incentive fees, approximately $6.3 million in interest expense, approximately $1.5 million in administrative agreement expenses, and approximately $2.8 million in general and administrative expenses. For the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014, total operating expenses were approximately $12.5 million, comprising of approximately $5.6 million in base management and incentive fees, approximately $3.9 million in interest expense, approximately $1.1 million in administrative agreement expenses, and approximately $1.9 million in general and administrative expenses. In determining the base management fee, our Adviser had agreed to exclude the U.S. Treasury bill assets acquired at the end of the applicable quarters in 2015 and 2014 in the calculation of the gross assets. We anticipate operating expenses will increase over time as our portfolio continues to grow. However, we anticipate operating expenses, as a percentage of totals assets and net assets, will decrease over time as our portfolio and capital base grow. We expect base management and income incentive fees will increase as we grow our asset base and our earnings. Capital gains incentive fee will depend on realized and unrealized gains and losses. Interest expense will increase as we utilize more of our Credit Facility, and we expect fees per the administrative agreement and general and administrative agreements will increase to meet the additional requirements associated with servicing a larger portfolio.\nThere were $0.3 million of realized losses during the year ended December 31, 2015 and no realized gains or losses for the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014.\nThe table below summarizes our net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments, which was primarily due to changes discount rates used to determine fair value. Net change in unrealized gains (losses) in subsequent periods may be volatile as it depends on changes in the market, changes in the underlying performance of our portfolio companies and their respective industries, and many other factors.\nTable 296: <table> <tr> <td> Net Change in Unrealized Gains (Losses)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For

estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. In addition to the discussion below, we describe our critical accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nValuation of Investments\nWe measure the value of our investments at fair value in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure, or ASC Topic 820,\u201d issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB.\u201d Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nThe Valuation Committee of the Board is responsible for assisting the Board in valuing investments that are not publicly traded or for which current market values are not readily available. Investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued using market quotations, which are generally obtained from independent pricing services, broker-dealers or market makers. With respect to portfolio investments for which market quotations\nare not readily available, the Board, with the assistance of the Adviser and its senior investment team and independent valuation agents, is responsible for determining, in good faith, the fair value in accordance with the valuation policy approved by the Board. If more than one valuation method is used to measure fair value, the results are evaluated and weighted, as appropriate, considering the reasonableness of the range indicated by those results. The Adviser considers a range of fair values based upon the valuation techniques utilized and generally selects a value within that range that most represents fair value based on current market conditions as well as other factors the Adviser's senior investment team considers relevant. The Board makes this fair value determination on at least a quarterly basis or at such other times when the Board feels it would be appropriate to do so given the circumstances. A determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates and depends on the facts and circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of portfolio investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material.\nASC Topic 820 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. ASC Topic 820 also provides guidance regarding a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings and provides for enhanced disclosures determined by the level within the hierarchy of information used in the valuation. In accordance with ASC Topic 820, these inputs are summarized in the three levels listed below.\nLevel 1-Valuations are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date.\nLevel 2-Valuations are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable.\nLevel 3-Valuations are based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models incorporating significant unobservable inputs, such as discounted cash flow models and other similar valuations techniques. The valuation of Level 3 assets and liabilities generally requires significant management judgment due to the inability to observe inputs to valuation.\nIn certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an investment's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of observable input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and it considers factors specific to the investment.\nUnder ASC 820, the fair value measurement also assumes that the transaction to sell an asset occurs in the principal market for the asset or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset, which may be a hypothetical market, and excludes transaction costs. The principal market for any asset is the market with the greatest volume and level of activity for such asset in which the reporting entity would or could sell or transfer the asset. In determining the principal market for an asset or liability, it is assumed that the reporting entity has access to such market as of the measurement date. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable and willing and able to transact.\nWith respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, the Board undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\nTable 301: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> The quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the Adviser's professionals that are responsible for the portfolio investment;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 302: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with the Adviser's senior investment team;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 303: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> The Valuation Committee then reviews these preliminary valuations and makes fair value recommendations to the Board;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 304: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> At least once annually, the valuation for each portfolio investment will be reviewed by an independent valuation firm. However, the Board does not intend to have de minimis investments of less than 1.0% of our gross assets (up to an aggregate of 10.0% of our gross assets) independently reviewed; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 305: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> The Board then discusses valuations and determines, in good faith, the fair value of each investment in our portfolio based on the input of the Adviser, the respective independent valuation firms and the Valuation Committee.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDebt Investments\nThe debt investments identified on the consolidated schedule of investments are loans and equipment financings made to venture growth stage companies focused in technology, life sciences and other high growth industries which are backed by a select group of leading venture capital investors. These investments are considered Level 3 assets under ASC Topic 820 because there is no known or accessible market or market indices for these types of debt instruments and thus the Adviser's senior management team must estimate the fair value of these investment securities based on models utilizing unobservable inputs.\nTo estimate the fair value of debt investments, we compare the cost basis of each debt investment, which includes original issue discount, to the resulting fair value determined using a discounted cash flow model, unless another model is more appropriate based on the circumstances at the measurement date. The discounted cash flow approach entails analyzing the interest rate spreads for recently completed financing transactions which are similar in nature to these debt investments, in order to determine a comparable range of effective market interest rates. The range of interest rate spreads utilized is based on borrowers with similar credit profiles. All remaining expected cash flows of the investment are discounted using this range of interest rates to determine a range of fair values for the debt investment.\nThis valuation process includes, among other things, evaluating the underlying investment performance and the portfolio company's current financial condition and ability to raise additional capital, as well as macro-economic events that may impact valuations. These events include, but are not limited to, current market yields and interest rate spreads of similar securities as of the measurement date. Changes in these unobservable inputs could result in significantly different fair value measurements.\nUnder certain circumstances, an alternative technique may be used to value certain debt investments that better reflected the fair value of the investment, such as the price paid or realized in a recently completed transaction or a binding offer received in an arm's length transaction, the use of multiple probability weighted cash flow models when the expected future cash flows contain elements of variability or estimates of proceeds that would be received in a liquidation scenario.\nWarrants\nThe fair value of the warrants is primarily estimated using a Black Scholes option pricing model. Privately held warrants and equity-related securities are valued based on an analysis of various factors, but not limited to, the following:\nTable 306: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Underlying enterprise value of the issuer is estimated based on information available, including any information regarding the most recent rounds of borrower funding. Valuation techniques to determine enterprise value include market multiple approaches, income approaches or approaches that utilize recent rounds of financing and the portfolio company's capital structure to determine enterprise value. Valuation techniques are also utilized to allocate the enterprise fair value of a portfolio company to the specific class of common or preferred stock exercisable in the warrant. Such techniques take into account the rights and preferences of the portfolio company's securities, expected exit scenarios, and volatility associated with such outcomes to allocate the fair value to the specific class of stock held in the portfolio. Such techniques included option pricing models, including back solve techniques, probability weighted expected return models and other techniques as determined to be appropriate.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 307: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Volatility, or the amount of uncertainty or risk about the size of the changes in the warrant price, is based on comparable publicly traded companies within indices similar in nature to the underlying\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 308: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> company issuing the warrant.

Warrants may be exercised in the event of acquisitions, mergers or initial public offerings, and cancelled due to events such as bankruptcies, restructuring activities or additional financings. These events cause the expected remaining life assumption to be shorter than the contractual term of the warrants. Increases (decreases) in this unobservable input could result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnder certain circumstances alternative techniques may be used to value certain warrants that better reflect the warrants' fair values, such as an expected settlement of a warrant in the near term, a model that incorporates a put feature associated with the warrant, or the price paid or realized in a recently completed transaction or binding offer received in an arm's length transaction. The fair value may be determined based on the expected proceeds to be received from such settlement or based on the net present value of the expected proceeds from the put option.\nThese valuation methodologies involve a significant degree of judgment. There is no single standard for determining the estimated fair value of investments which do not have an active public market. Valuations of privately held investments are inherently uncertain, as they are based on estimates, and their values may fluctuate over time. The determination of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if an active market for these investments existed. In some cases, the fair value of such investments is best expressed as a range of values derived utilizing different methodologies from which a single estimate may then be determined.\nEquity Investments\nThe fair value of an equity investment in a privately held company is initially the amount invested. We adjust the fair value of equity investments in private companies upon the completion of a new third party round of equity financing subsequent to its investment. We may make adjustments to fair value, absent a new equity financing event, based upon positive or negative changes in a portfolio company's financial or operational performance. We may also reference comparable transactions and/or secondary market transactions of comparable companies to estimate fair value. These valuation methodologies involve a significant degree of judgment. The fair value of an equity investment in a publicly traded company is based upon the closing public share price on the date of measurement. These assets are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. There is no single standard for determining the estimated fair value of investments which do not have an active public market. Valuations of privately held investments are inherently uncertain, as they are based on estimates, and their values may fluctuate over time. The determination of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if an active market for these investments existed. In some cases, the fair value of such investments is best expressed as a range of values derived utilizing different methodologies from which a single estimate may then be determined.\nIncome Recognition\nInterest income, adjusted for amortization of market premium and accretion of market discount, is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. Original issue discount, principally representing the estimated fair value of detachable equity or warrants obtained in conjunction with our debt investments, and market discount or premium are capitalized and accreted or amortized into interest income over the life of the respective security using the effective interest method. Loan origination fees received in connection with the closing of investments are reported as unearned income which is included as amortized cost of the investment; the unearned income from such fees is accreted over the contractual life of the loan based on the effective interest\nmethod as interest income. Upon prepayment of a loan or debt security, unamortized loan origination fees and unamortized market discounts are recorded as interest income. End-of-term (EOT) payments are contractual and fixed interest payments due in cash at the maturity date of the loan, including upon prepayment, and are a fixed percentage of the original principal balance of the loan unless otherwise noted. Interest is accrued during the life of the loan on the EOT payment using the effective interest method as non-cash income. The EOT payment generally ceases accruing to the extent the borrower is unable to pay the remaining principal and interest due. The EOT payment may also include a cash success fee due upon the earlier of the maturity date of the loans or in the event of a certain milestone reached by the portfolio company.\nFor debt investments with contractual payment-in-kind ( PIK\u201d) interest, which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the principal balance that generally becomes due at maturity, we do not accrue PIK interest if it is deemed uncollectible.\nOther income includes certain fees paid by portfolio companies (for example, extension fees, revolver loan facility fees, prepayment fees) and the recognition of the value of unfunded commitments that expired during the reporting period.\nRealized/Unrealized Gains or Losses\nWe measure realized gains or losses from the repayment or sale of investments using the specific identification method. The amortized cost basis of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the accretion/amortization of discounts and premiums and upfront loan origination fees. We report changes in fair value of investments that are measured at fair value as a component of net change in unrealized gain (loss) on investments in the consolidated statements of operations.\nU.S. Federal Income Taxes\nWe have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under Subchapter M the Code, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, beginning with our taxable year ending December 31, 2014. Generally, a RIC is not subject to U.S. federal income taxes on distributed income and gains if it distributes at least 90% of its net ordinary income and net short-term capital gains in excess of its net long-term capital losses, if any, to its stockholders. Additionally, a RIC must distribute at least 98% of its ordinary income and 98.2% of its capital gain net income on an annual basis and any net ordinary income and net capital gains for preceding years that were not distributed during such years and on which the RIC previously paid no U.S. federal income tax to avoid a U.S. federal excise tax. We intend to distribute sufficient dividends to maintain our RIC status each year and do not anticipate paying any material U.S. federal income taxes in the future.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, cash provided by operating activities, consisting primarily of purchases, sales and repayments of investments and the items described in Results of Operations,\u201d was approximately $2.1 million. Cash provided by financing activities, including net proceeds from issuance of common stock and net proceeds from issuance of 2020 Notes, net of repayment of borrowings and dividend distributions, was approximately $23.4 million. As of December 31, 2015, cash, including restricted cash, was approximately $38.5 million.\nOn March 27, 2015, we priced a public equity offering of 6.5 million shares of our common stock, raising approximately $93.7 million after offering costs. The proceeds from this public equity offering of our common stock were received on April 1, 2015. On April 29, 2015, we received an additional approximately $2.2 million through the issuance of 154,018 shares of our Company's common stock as the result of underwriters' partial exercise of their overallotment option. We used a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to temporarily repay a portion of our outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility.\nFor the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014, cash used in operating activities, consisting primarily of purchases, sales and repayments of investments and the items described\nin Results of Operations,\u201d was approximately $238.4 million. Cash provided by financing activities, including net proceeds from issuance of common stock and net borrowings, was approximately $245.3 million. As of December 31, 2014, cash, including restricted cash, was approximately $14.9 million.\nAs a BDC, we generally have an ongoing need to raise additional capital for investment purposes. As a result, we expect, from time to time, to access the debt and equity markets when we believe it is necessary and appropriate to do so. In this regard, we continue to explore various options for obtaining additional debt or equity capital for investments. This may include expanding or extending our credit facility, or the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or debt securities. If we are unable to obtain leverage or raise equity capital on terms that are acceptable to us, our ability to grow our portfolio could be substantially impacted.\nContractual Obligations\nIn February 2014, we entered into a credit agreement with Deutsche Bank, acting as administrative agent and a lender, and KeyBank National Association, Everbank Commercial Lender Finance, Inc., and AloStar Bank of Commerce, as other lenders, which provided us with a $150.0 million commitment, subject to borrowing base requirements. In August 2014, we amended our Credit Facility to increase the total commitments available there under by $50.0 million to $200.0 million in aggregate, subject to borrowing base requirements.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had outstanding borrowings of $18.0 million and $118.0 million, respectively, under our Credit Facility, which is included in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. We had $182.0 million and $82.0 million of remaining capacity on our Credit Facility as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.\nOn August 4, 2015, we completed a public offering of $50.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2020 Notes and received net proceeds of $48.3 million after the payment of fees and offering costs. The interest on the 2020 Notes is payable quarterly on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15, beginning on October 15, 2015. The 2020 Notes are currently listed on the NYSE under the symbol TPVZ\u201d. On September 2, 2015, we issued an additional $4.6 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2020 Notes and received net proceeds of approximately $4.5 million after the payment of fees and offering costs as a result of the underwriters' partial exercise of their option to purchase additional 2020 Notes.\nThe tables below provide a summary of when payments are due under our Credit Facility and 2020 Notes as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nTable 312: <table> <tr> <td> Payments Due By Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2020 Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 72,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 54,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 313: <table> <tr> <td> Payments Due By Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 118,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 118,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 118,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 118,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe are a party to certain delay draw credit agreements with our portfolio companies, which require us to make future advances at the companies' discretion during a defined loan availability period. Our credit agreements contain customary lending provisions which allow us relief from funding obligations for previously made commitments in instances where the underlying company experiences materially adverse events that affect the financial condition or business outlook for the company. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, our unfunded commitments to twelve and eleven companies, respectively, totaled approximately $190.0 million and $211.0 million, respectively.

Over time, we generally expect approximately 75% of our gross unfunded commitments to be drawn before the expiration of their corresponding availability periods. We evaluate funding needs and expectations for each company at the time of commitment and as the company progresses and develops during the availability period. As of December 31, 2015, we had a payable of approximately $70.0 million due January 5, 2016, for the acquisition of U.S. Treasury bills. On January 5, 2016, we sold the U.S. Treasury bills and settled the payable in full. As of December 31, 2014, we had a payable of approximately $50.0 million due January 2, 2015, for the acquisition of U.S. Treasury bills. We sold the U.S. Treasury bills on January 2, 2015 and settled the payable in full.\nIn addition to the contractual obligations set forth above, we have certain obligations with respect to the investment advisory and administration services we received during the year ended December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the outstanding obligations totaled approximately $3.1 million and $4.6 million, respectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, our off-balance sheet arrangements consisted of approximately, $190.0 million and $211.0 million, respectively, of unfunded commitments, of which $50.0 million and $40.5 million, respectively, was dependent upon the companies reaching certain milestones before the debt commitment becomes available to them.

Additionally, we must distribute at least 98% of our ordinary income and 98.2% of our capital gain net income on an annual basis and any net ordinary income and net capital gains for preceding years that were not distributed during such years and on which we previously paid no U.S. federal income tax to avoid a U.S. federal excise tax. To the extent our earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for a taxable year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a tax-free return of capital to our stockholders. Our Adviser monitors available taxable earnings, including net investment income and realized capital gains, to determine if a tax-free return of capital may occur for the year. The tax character of distributions will be determined at the end of the taxable year. Stockholders should read any written disclosure accompanying a dividend payment carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our taxable ordinary income or capital gains. The specific tax characteristics of our distributions will be reported to stockholders after the end of the taxable year.\nRelated Parties\nWe have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following:\nTable 316: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> We have entered into an advisory agreement, dated February 18, 2014, with our Adviser.

Our Code of Ethics requires that all employees and directors avoid any conflict, or the appearance of a conflict, between an individual's personal interests and our interests. Pursuant to our Code of Ethics, each employee and director must disclose any conflicts of interest, or actions or relationships that might give rise to a conflict, to our Chief Compliance Officer. Our Audit Committee is charged with approving any waivers under our Code of Ethics. As required by the NYSE corporate governance listing standards, the Audit Committee of our board of directors (the Board\u201d) is also required to review and approve any transactions with related parties (as such term is defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K).\nRecent Developments\nDividends\nOn March 14, 2016, we announced that our Board declared a $0.36 per share regular quarterly dividend, payable on April 15, 2016 to stockholders of record on March 31, 2016.\nCredit Facility\nOn January 27, 2016, we amended our Credit Facility to: (i) reduce the applicable margin above the base rates specified in the Credit Facility from 3.50% to 3.00%, and (ii) extended the revolving period of the Credit Facility from February 21, 2016 to February 21, 2018 and the maturity date of the Credit Facility from February 21, 2017 to February 21, 2019.\nRecent Portfolio Activity\nFrom January 1, 2016 through March 11, 2016, we closed $75.0 million of additional debt commitments and funded $31.3 million in new investments.

These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about TriplePoint Venture Growth BDC Corp., our current and prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs, and our assumptions. Words such as anticipates,\u201d expects,\u201d intends,\u201d plans,\u201d will,\u201d may,\u201d continue,\u201d believes,\u201d seeks,\u201d estimates,\u201d would,\u201d could,\u201d should,\u201d targets,\u201d projects,\u201d and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K include statements as to:\n \u00b7 our future operating results; \n \u00b7 our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies; \n \u00b7 our relationships with third parties including venture capital investors; \n \u00b7 the impact and timing of our unfunded commitments; \n \u00b7 the expected market for venture capital investments; \n \u00b7 the performance of our existing portfolio and other investments we may make in the future; \n \u00b7 the impact of investments that we expect to make; \n \u00b7 actual and potential conflicts of interest with TPC and our Adviser and its senior investment team and Investment Committee; \n \u00b7 our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; \n \u00b7 the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its impact on the industries in which we invest; \n \u00b7 the ability of our portfolio companies to achieve their objectives; \n \u00b7 our expected financings and investments; \n \u00b7 the ability of our Adviser to attract, retain and have access to highly talented professionals, including our Adviser's senior management team; \n \u00b7 our ability to qualify and maintain our qualification as a RIC and as a BDC; \n \u00b7 the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital; and \n \u00b7 the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our portfolio companies. \nThese statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements, including without limitation:\n \u00b7 an economic downturn could impair our portfolio companies' ability to continue to operate, which could lead to the loss of some or all of our investments in such portfolio companies; \n \u00b7 a contraction of available credit and/or an inability to access the equity markets could impair our lending and investment activities; \n \u00b7 interest rate volatility could adversely affect our results, particularly when we elect to use leverage as part of our investment strategy; \n \u00b7 currency fluctuations could adversely affect the results of our investments in foreign companies, particularly to the extent that we receive payments denominated in foreign currency rather than U.S. dollars; and \n \u00b7 the risks, uncertainties and other factors we identify in Risk Factors\u201d in this annual report on Form 10-K under Part 1A and in our other filings with the SEC. \nAlthough we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. Important assumptions include our ability to originate new loans and investments, certain margins and levels of profitability and the availability of additional capital. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this annual report on Form 10-K should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. These risks and uncertainties include those described in Risk Factors\u201d in this annual report on Form 10-K under Part 1A. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ending December 31, 2014.\nOur shares are currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE\u201d) under the symbol TPVG\u201d. Our 6.75% Notes due 2020 (the \"2020 Notes\") are currently listed on the NYSE under the symbol TPVZ\u201d.\nOur investment objective is to maximize our total return to stockholders primarily in the form of current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation by primarily lending with warrants to venture growth stage companies focused in technology, life sciences and other high growth industries which are backed by TPC's select group of leading venture capital investors.\nWe were formed to expand the venture growth stage business segment of TPC's global investment platform and are the primary vehicle through which TPC focuses its venture growth stage business. TPC is widely recognized as a leading global financing provider devoted to serving venture capital-backed companies with creative, flexible and customized debt financing, equity capital and complementary services throughout their lifespan. TPC is located on Sand Hill Road in Silicon Valley and has a primary focus in technology, life sciences and other high growth industries.\nWe commenced investment activities on March 5, 2014. In order to expedite the ramp-up of our investment activities and further our ability to meet our investment objectives, on March 5, 2014, we acquired our initial portfolio. The net consideration paid was approximately $121.7 million which reflected approximately $123.7 million of investments less approximately $2.0 million of prepaid interest and the fair value of unfunded commitments. We financed the acquisition of our initial portfolio by using a portion of a $200.0 million credit facility (the Bridge Facility\u201d) provided by Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch ( Deutsche Bank\u201d). On March 11, 2014, we completed our initial public offering and sold 9,840,665 shares of common stock (including 1,250,000 shares of common stock through the underwriters' exercise of their overallotment option and the concurrent private placement of 257,332 shares of common stock to our Adviser's senior team and other persons associated with TPC) of our common stock at an offering price of $15.00 per share. We received $141.6 million of net proceeds in connection with the initial public offering and concurrent private placement, net of the portion of the underwriting sales load and offering costs we paid. We used a portion of these net proceeds to pay down all amounts outstanding under the Bridge Facility and terminated the Bridge Facility in conjunction with such repayment.\nIn February 2014, we entered into a credit agreement with Deutsche Bank acting as administrative agent and a lender, and KeyBank National Association, Everbank Commercial Lender Finance, Inc., and AloStar Bank of Commerce, as other lenders, which provided us with a $150.0 million commitment, subject to borrowing base\nrequirements ( Credit Facility\u201d). In August 2014, we amended the Credit Facility to increase the total commitments by $50.0 million to $200.0 million in aggregate. Effective as of a January 2016 amendment to the Credit Facility, borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at the sum of (i) the commercial paper rate for certain specified lenders and 30-day LIBOR for other lenders or, if LIBOR is unavailable, the higher of Deutsche Bank's commercial lending rate or the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50% plus (ii) a margin of 3.0% during the Credit Facility's revolving period. The revolving period under the amended Credit Facility expires in February 2018.\nOn March 27, 2015, we priced a public offering of 6,500,000 shares of our common stock, raising approximately $93.7 million after offering costs. On April 29, 2015, we received an additional approximately $2.2 million through the issuance of 154,018 shares of our common stock as the result of the underwriters' partial exercise of their overallotment option.\nOn August 4, 2015, we completed a public offering of $50.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2020 Notes and received net proceeds of $48.3 million after the payment of fees and offering costs. The interest on the 2020 Notes is payable quarterly on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15, beginning on October 15, 2015. On September 2, 2015, we issued an additional $4.6 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2020 Notes and received net proceeds of approximately $4.5 million, after the payment of the underwriting sales load and offering costs, as a result of the underwriters' partial exercise of their option to purchase additional 2020 Notes.\nPortfolio Composition, Investment Activity and Asset Quality\nPortfolio Composition\nWe originate and invest primarily in venture growth stage companies. Companies at the venture growth stage have distinct characteristics differentiating them from venture capital-backed companies at other stages in their development lifecycle. We invest primarily in (i) growth capital loans that have a secured collateral position and that are used by venture growth stage companies to finance their continued expansion and growth, (ii) equipment financings, which may be structured as loans or leases, that have a secured collateral position on specified mission-critical equipment, (iii) on a select basis, revolving loans that have a secured collateral position and that are used by venture growth stage companies to advance against inventory, components, accounts receivable, contractual or future billings, bookings, revenues, sales or cash payments and collections including proceeds from a sale, financing or the equivalent and (iv) direct equity investments in venture growth stage companies. In connection with our growth capital loans, equipment financings and revolving loans, we generally receive warrants that allow us to participate in any equity appreciation of our borrowers and enhance our overall investment returns.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had 85 investments in 34 companies and our four largest portfolio companies represented approximately 43.7% of our portfolio investments. Our investments included 47 debt investments, 31 warrant investments, and seven direct equity investments. The total cost and fair value of these investments were approximately $276.4 million and approximately $271.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, two of our customers were publicly traded. At December 31, 2015, the 47 debt investments with an aggregate fair value of approximately $259.6 million had a weighted average loan to enterprise value at the time of underwriting ratio of approximately 19.2%. Enterprise value of the borrower is estimated based on information available, including any information regarding the most recent rounds of borrower funding. Excluding the debt investment to Intermodal Data, Inc. (due to its foreclosure agreement to purchase certain assets and assume the outstanding obligations - see further discussion in Asset Quality\u201d section), the weighted average loan to enterprise value at the time of underwriting ratio was approximately 8.6%.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had 76 investments in 27 companies. Our investments included 46 debt investments, 26 warrant investments, and four direct equity investments. The total cost and fair value of these investments were approximately $256.5 million and approximately $258.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, one of our customers was publicly traded. At December 31, 2014, the 46 debt investments with an aggregate fair value of approximately $247.6 million had a weighted average loan to enterprise value at the time of underwriting ratio of approximately 9.1%.\nThe following tables provide information on the cost, fair value, and net unrealized gains (losses) of our investments in companies along with the number of companies in our portfolio as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\n\n\n * Represents non-duplicative number of companies. \nThe following tables show the fair value of the portfolio of investments, by industry and the percentage of the total investment portfolio, as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\n\n\n * Less than 0.05%. \nThe following tables present the product type of our debt investments as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\n\n\nApproximately 18.0% and 20.5% of the debt investments in our portfolio as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, based on the aggregate fair value, consisted of growth capital loans where the borrower has a term loan facility, with or without an accompanying revolving loan, in priority to our senior lien.\nInvestment Activity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we entered into fifteen new commitments with eight new customers, six existing customers and one previous customer totaling $213.8 million, funded seventeen debt investments for approximately $101.3 million in principal value, acquired warrants representing approximately $1.8\nmillion of value and exercised warrants into equity with a cost basis of approximately $0.2 million in one company, and made two equity investments of approximately $0.7 million. During the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014, we entered into fifteen new commitments with eleven new customers and four existing customers totaling $269.5 million, we funded 32 debt investments for approximately $159.4 million in principal balance, acquired warrants representing approximately $3.5 million of value, and made two equity investments totaling approximately $0.5 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we had prepayments from six of our portfolio companies for approximately $73.4 million in principal value. During the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014, we had prepayments from two of our portfolio companies for approximately $27.7 million in principal value.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our unfunded commitments to twelve companies totaled approximately $190.0 million; as of December 31, 2014, our unfunded commitments to eleven companies totaled $211.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2015, $35.0 million in unfunded commitments were terminated, $98.5 million in unfunded commitments expired and approximately $101.3 million were funded. During the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014, $50.3 million in unfunded commitments expired and approximately $159.4 million were funded. The following table provides additional information on our unfunded commitments regarding milestones, expirations, the companies' industries, and types of loans.\n\nOur credit agreements with our customers contain customary lending provisions which allow us relief from funding obligations for previously made commitments in instances where the underlying company experiences materially adverse events that affect the financial condition or business outlook for the company. Since these commitments may expire without being drawn upon, unfunded commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements or future earning assets for the Company. We generally expect approximately 75% of our gross unfunded commitments to eventually be drawn before the expiration of their corresponding availability periods.\nThe fair value at the inception of the agreement of the delay draw credit agreements with our customers is equal to the fees and/or warrants received to enter into these agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties' credit profile. The unfunded commitment liability reflects the fair value of these future funding commitments. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the fair value for these unfunded commitments totaled approximately $1.1 million and $2.1 million, respectively, and was included in other accrued expenses and liabilities\u201d in our consolidated statements of assets and liabilities.\nOur level of investment activity can vary substantially from period to period as our Adviser chooses to slow or accelerate new business originations depending on market conditions, rate of investment of TPC's select group of leading venture capital investors, our Adviser's knowledge, expertise and experience, our funding capacity\n(including availability under our credit facilities and our ability or inability to raise equity or debt capital), and other market dynamics.\nThe following table shows the debt commitments, fundings of debt investments (principal balance) and equity investments and non-binding term sheet activity for the year ended December 31, 2015 and for the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014.\n\nOn December 31, 2015, we acquired $70.0 million in U.S. Treasury bills which were subsequently sold on January 5, 2016. On December 30, 2014, we acquired $50.0 million in U.S. Treasury bills which were subsequently sold on January 2, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2015, and the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014, we acquired approximately $130.0 million and $210.0 million, respectively, of U.S. Treasury bills and sold approximately $110.0 million and $160.0 million, respectively, of U.S. Treasury bills. The purchase and sale of U.S. Treasury bills were done to efficiently meet certain diversification tests.\nAsset Quality\nConsistent with TPC's existing policies, our Adviser maintains a credit watch list with borrowers placed into five groups based on our Adviser's senior investment team's judgment, where 1 is the highest rating and all new loans are generally assigned a rating of 2.\n\nAs of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the weighted average investment ranking of our debt investment portfolio was 2.23 and 2.06, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015, there were five changes within the credit categories. One borrower with a principal balance of $5.0 million was upgraded from White (2) to Clear (1). One borrower with a principal balance of $6.9 million was downgraded from White (2) to Yellow (3). Two borrowers, Virtual Instruments Corporation with principal balance of $25.6 million and Mind Candy Limited with principal balance of $10.0 million, were downgraded from Yellow (3) to Orange (4). The other downgrade included the debt investments that were initially to Coraid, Inc., which were assumed by Intermodal Data, Inc. as part of the foreclosure agreement it entered into to purchase certain assets and assume the outstanding obligations owed to us. The debt investment to Intermodal Data, Inc. was ranked as Orange (4) as of December 31, 2015.\nDuring the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014, there were four changes within the credit categories. Two borrowers were moved to Clear (1) from White (2) and one subsequently paid off its loans and is no longer in our portfolio. Two borrowers were moved to Yellow (3) from White (2).\nThe following tables show the credit rankings for the portfolio companies that had outstanding obligations to us as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\n\n\nResults of Operations\nOperating results for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014\nAn important measure of our financial performance is net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income (loss), net realized gains (losses) and net unrealized gains (losses). Net investment income (loss) is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees and other investment income and our operating expenses including interest on borrowed funds. Net realized gains (losses) on investments are the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their amortized cost. Net unrealized gains (losses) on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio.\nSince we commenced operations on March 5, 2014, the results of operations for the period ended December 31, 2014 represents only 302 days of operations, as compared to 365 days for the year ended December 31, 2015, which accounts for most of the differences in operating results over these two periods.\nAs summarized in the table below, for the year ended December 31, 2015, our net increase in net assets resulting from operations was approximately $15.5 million, which was comprised of approximately $21.9 million of net investment income, partially offset by approximately $0.3 million of net realized losses and approximately $6.1 million of net change in unrealized losses. On a per share basis, net investment income was $1.46 per share and the net increase in net assets from operations was $1.03 per share. Our core net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately $21.6 million, or $1.44 per share. For the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014, our net increase in net assets resulting from operations was approximately $14.3 million, consisting of approximately $12.8 million in net investment income and approximately $1.5 million of net change in unrealized gains on investments. On a per share basis, net investment income was $1.30 per share and the net change in net assets from operations was $1.45 per share. Our core net investment income for the same period was approximately $13.1 million, or $1.33 per share.\nOur investment and other income increased by $16.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014 primarily due to the increase in average portfolio balance and higher prepayment activity in 2015. The year-over-year fluctuations were also due to the lower number of days of operations in 2014. Operating expenses also increased by $7.6 million during the same period for the following reasons: higher base management and incentive fees of $3.9 million due to higher asset balance and higher returns, higher interest expense of $2.4 million due to higher outstanding average balances and issuance of 2020 Notes in the third quarter of 2015, increase in general and administrative expenses of $0.9 million and administration agreement expenses of $0.4 million primarily due to the difference in number of days of operations in 2014. Net investment income and core net investment income increased during the same period for the reasons noted above.\nNet realized losses were approximately $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the losses on warrants of one portfolio company. There were no realized gains or losses during any period in 2014. Net change in unrealized losses during the year ended December 31, 2015, were $6.1 million as compared to a net change in unrealized gains of $1.5 million during the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to\nDecember 31, 2014. These have been discussed in more detail in the tables below. Our net increase in net assets from operations increased for the reasons noted above.\nThe table below presents our statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 and for the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014.\n\nThe table below reconciles generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\u201d) net income to core net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2015, and for the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014. Core net investment income, unlike GAAP net investment income, excludes accrued, but as yet unearned, capital gains incentive fee. We believe an important measure of the investment income that we will be required to distribute each year is core net investment income as capital gains incentive fee is accrued based on unrealized gains but are not earned until realized gains occur. Specifically, the capital gains component of the incentive fee is paid at the end of each calendar year and is 20.0% of our aggregate cumulative realized capital gains from commencement of operations through the end of the year, computed net of our aggregate cumulative realized capital losses and our aggregate cumulative unrealized losses through the end of such year. For the foregoing purpose, our aggregate cumulative realized capital gains\u201d does not include any unrealized gains. The capital gains component of the incentive fee is not subject to any minimum return to stockholders. For the year ended December 31, 2015 and the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014, no net capital gains were realized and thus no capital gains incentive fee was earned and was payable. During the same periods, we reported approximately $6.1 million in net change in unrealized losses and approximately $1.5 million in net change in unrealized gains, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015 we reversed previously accrued capital gains incentive fee of approximately $0.3 million. For the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014, we accrued approximately $0.3 million in capital gains incentive fee.\n\nInvestment income includes interest income on our debt investments utilizing the effective yield method and includes cash interest income as well as the amortization of purchase premium, accretion of purchase discount, original issue discount, facilities fees, and the amortization and payment of the end-of-term ( EOT\u201d) payments. For the year ended December 31, 2015 and for the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014, investment income totaled approximately $39.9 million and $24.7 million, respectively, representing a weighted average portfolio yield of approximately 17.0% and 15.4%, respectively, on debt investments for the periods held.\nWe calculate weighted average portfolio yields for periods shown as the annualized rates of the interest income recognized during the period divided by the average amortized cost of debt investments in the portfolio at the beginning of each month in the period. The weighted average yields reported for these periods are annualized and reflect the weighted average yields to maturities. Should the portfolio companies choose to repay their loans earlier, our weighted average yields will increase for those debt investments affected but may reduce our weighted average yields on the remaining portfolio in future quarters. As our portfolio grows and seasons, we expect our loans to be outstanding for shorter periods than to maturity and to reflect healthy prepayment activity.\nThe following table provides the weighted average portfolio yield on our portfolio comprising of cash interest income, accretion of the net purchase discount, facilities fees and the value of warrants received, accretion of EOT payments and the accelerated receipt of EOT payments on prepayments.\n\n (1) The yields for periods shown are the annualized rates of interest income or the components of interest income recognized during the period divided by the average amortized cost of debt investments in the portfolio at the beginning of each month in the period. \nThe yield on our portfolio, excluding the impact of prepayments was approximately 15.4% and 14.5%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015 and for the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of\noperations) to December 31, 2014. The yields on our portfolio are dependent on fundings and the performance of our loans including prepayments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized approximately $2.2 million in other income consisting of approximately $1.8 million due to the termination or expiration of unfunded commitments and approximately $0.4 million from the realization of certain fees paid by companies and miscellaneous income. For the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014, we recognized approximately $0.7 million in other income consisting of approximately $0.4 million due to the termination or expiration of unfunded commitments and approximately $0.3 million from the realization of certain fees paid by companies and miscellaneous income.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, total operating expenses were approximately $20.1 million, comprising of approximately $9.5 million in base management and incentive fees, approximately $6.3 million in interest expense, approximately $1.5 million in administrative agreement expenses, and approximately $2.8 million in general and administrative expenses. For the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014, total operating expenses were approximately $12.5 million, comprising of approximately $5.6 million in base management and incentive fees, approximately $3.9 million in interest expense, approximately $1.1 million in administrative agreement expenses, and approximately $1.9 million in general and administrative expenses. In determining the base management fee, our Adviser had agreed to exclude the U.S. Treasury bill assets acquired at the end of the applicable quarters in 2015 and 2014 in the calculation of the gross assets. We anticipate operating expenses will increase over time as our portfolio continues to grow. However, we anticipate operating expenses, as a percentage of totals assets and net assets, will decrease over time as our portfolio and capital base grow. We expect base management and income incentive fees will increase as we grow our asset base and our earnings. Capital gains incentive fee will depend on realized and unrealized gains and losses. Interest expense will increase as we utilize more of our Credit Facility, and we expect fees per the administrative agreement and general and administrative agreements will increase to meet the additional requirements associated with servicing a larger portfolio.\nThere were $0.3 million of realized losses during the year ended December 31, 2015 and no realized gains or losses for the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014.\nThe table below summarizes our net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments, which was primarily due to changes discount rates used to determine fair value. Net change in unrealized gains (losses) in subsequent periods may be volatile as it depends on changes in the market, changes in the underlying performance of our portfolio companies and their respective industries, and many other factors.\n\nThe tables below summarize the unrealized gains and losses in our investments in portfolio companies as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\n\n\nIn addition to the unrealized gains and losses in our investments in portfolio companies summarized in the table above, there were unrealized losses of approximately $3 thousand, on U.S. Treasury bills as of both December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nThe table below summarizes our return on average total assets and return on average net asset value for the year ended December 31, 2015 and for the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014.\n\n (1) Percentage is presented on an annualized basis. \nThe average net asset values and the average total assets are computed based on daily balances.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. In addition to the discussion below, we describe our critical accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nValuation of Investments\nWe measure the value of our investments at fair value in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure, or ASC Topic 820,\u201d issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB.\u201d Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nThe Valuation Committee of the Board is responsible for assisting the Board in valuing investments that are not publicly traded or for which current market values are not readily available. Investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued using market quotations, which are generally obtained from independent pricing services, broker-dealers or market makers. With respect to portfolio investments for which market quotations\nare not readily available, the Board, with the assistance of the Adviser and its senior investment team and independent valuation agents, is responsible for determining, in good faith, the fair value in accordance with the valuation policy approved by the Board. If more than one valuation method is used to measure fair value, the results are evaluated and weighted, as appropriate, considering the reasonableness of the range indicated by those results. The Adviser considers a range of fair values based upon the valuation techniques utilized and generally selects a value within that range that most represents fair value based on current market conditions as well as other factors the Adviser's senior investment team considers relevant. The Board makes this fair value determination on at least a quarterly basis or at such other times when the Board feels it would be appropriate to do so given the circumstances. A determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates and depends on the facts and circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of portfolio investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material.\nASC Topic 820 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. ASC Topic 820 also provides guidance regarding a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings and provides for enhanced disclosures determined by the level within the hierarchy of information used in the valuation. In accordance with ASC Topic 820, these inputs are summarized in the three levels listed below.\nLevel 1-Valuations are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date.\nLevel 2-Valuations are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable.\nLevel 3-Valuations are based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models incorporating significant unobservable inputs, such as discounted cash flow models and other similar valuations techniques. The valuation of Level 3 assets and liabilities generally requires significant management judgment due to the inability to observe inputs to valuation.\nIn certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an investment's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of observable input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and it considers factors specific to the investment.\nUnder ASC 820, the fair value measurement also assumes that the transaction to sell an asset occurs in the principal market for the asset or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset, which may be a hypothetical market, and excludes transaction costs. The principal market for any asset is the market with the greatest volume and level of activity for such asset in which the reporting entity would or could sell or transfer the asset. In determining the principal market for an asset or liability, it is assumed that the reporting entity has access to such market as of the measurement date. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable and willing and able to transact.\nWith respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, the Board undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\n \u00b7 The quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the Adviser's professionals that are responsible for the portfolio investment; \n \u00b7 Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with the Adviser's senior investment team; \n \u00b7 The Valuation Committee then reviews these preliminary valuations and makes fair value recommendations to the Board; \n \u00b7 At least once annually, the valuation for each portfolio investment will be reviewed by an independent valuation firm. However, the Board does not intend to have de minimis investments of less than 1.0% of our gross assets (up to an aggregate of 10.0% of our gross assets) independently reviewed; and \n \u00b7 The Board then discusses valuations and determines, in good faith, the fair value of each investment in our portfolio based on the input of the Adviser, the respective independent valuation firms and the Valuation Committee. \nDebt Investments\nThe debt investments identified on the consolidated schedule of investments are loans and equipment financings made to venture growth stage companies focused in technology, life sciences and other high growth industries which are backed by a select group of leading venture capital investors. These investments are considered Level 3 assets under ASC Topic 820 because there is no known or accessible market or market indices for these types of debt instruments and thus the Adviser's senior management team must estimate the fair value of these investment securities based on models utilizing unobservable inputs.\nTo estimate the fair value of debt investments, we compare the cost basis of each debt investment, which includes original issue discount, to the resulting fair value determined using a discounted cash flow model, unless another model is more appropriate based on the circumstances at the measurement date. The discounted cash flow approach entails analyzing the interest rate spreads for recently completed financing transactions which are similar in nature to these debt investments, in order to determine a comparable range of effective market interest rates. The range of interest rate spreads utilized is based on borrowers with similar credit profiles. All remaining expected cash flows of the investment are discounted using this range of interest rates to determine a range of fair values for the debt investment.\nThis valuation process includes, among other things, evaluating the underlying investment performance and the portfolio company's current financial condition and ability to raise additional capital, as well as macro-economic events that may impact valuations. These events include, but are not limited to, current market yields and interest rate spreads of similar securities as of the measurement date. Changes in these unobservable inputs could result in significantly different fair value measurements.\nUnder certain circumstances, an alternative technique may be used to value certain debt investments that better reflected the fair value of the investment, such as the price paid or realized in a recently completed transaction or a binding offer received in an", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and schedules thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.

The forward-looking statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K include statements as to:\n \u00b7 our future operating results; \n \u00b7 our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies; \n \u00b7 our relationships with third parties including venture capital investors; \n \u00b7 the impact and timing of our unfunded commitments; \n \u00b7 the expected market for venture capital investments; \n \u00b7 the performance of our existing portfolio and other investments we may make in the future; \n \u00b7 the impact of investments that we expect to make; \n \u00b7 actual and potential conflicts of interest with TPC and our Adviser and its senior investment team and Investment Committee; \n \u00b7 our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; \n \u00b7 the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its impact on the industries in which we invest; \n \u00b7 the ability of our portfolio companies to achieve their objectives; \n \u00b7 our expected financings and investments; \n \u00b7 the ability of our Adviser to attract, retain and have access to highly talented professionals, including our Adviser's senior management team; \n \u00b7 our ability to qualify and maintain our qualification as a RIC and as a BDC; \n \u00b7 the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital; and \n \u00b7 the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our portfolio companies. \nThese statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements, including without limitation:\n \u00b7 an economic downturn could impair our portfolio companies' ability to continue to operate, which could lead to the loss of some or all of our investments in such portfolio companies; \n \u00b7 a contraction of available credit and/or an inability to access the equity markets could impair our lending and investment activities; \n \u00b7 interest rate volatility could adversely affect our results, particularly when we elect to use leverage as part of our investment strategy; \n \u00b7 currency fluctuations could adversely affect the results of our investments in foreign companies, particularly to the extent that we receive payments denominated in foreign currency rather than U.S. dollars; and \n \u00b7 the risks, uncertainties and other factors we identify in Risk Factors\u201d in this annual report on Form 10-K under Part 1A and in our other filings with the SEC. \nAlthough we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. Important assumptions include our ability to originate new loans and investments, certain margins and levels of profitability and the availability of additional capital. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this annual report on Form 10-K should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. These risks and uncertainties include those described in Risk Factors\u201d in this annual report on Form 10-K under Part 1A. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ending December 31, 2014.\nOur shares are currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE\u201d) under the symbol TPVG\u201d. Our 6.75% Notes due 2020 (the \"2020 Notes\") are currently listed on the NYSE under the symbol TPVZ\u201d.\nOur investment objective is to maximize our total return to stockholders primarily in the form of current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation by primarily lending with warrants to venture growth stage companies focused in technology, life sciences and other high growth industries which are backed by TPC's select group of leading venture capital investors.\nWe were formed to expand the venture growth stage business segment of TPC's global investment platform and are the primary vehicle through which TPC focuses its venture growth stage business. TPC is widely recognized as a leading global financing provider devoted to serving venture capital-backed companies with creative, flexible and customized debt financing, equity capital and complementary services throughout their lifespan. TPC is located on Sand Hill Road in Silicon Valley and has a primary focus in technology, life sciences and other high growth industries.\nWe commenced investment activities on March 5, 2014. In order to expedite the ramp-up of our investment activities and further our ability to meet our investment objectives, on March 5, 2014, we acquired our initial portfolio. The net consideration paid was approximately $121.7 million which reflected approximately $123.7 million of investments less approximately $2.0 million of prepaid interest and the fair value of unfunded commitments. We financed the acquisition of our initial portfolio by using a portion of a $200.0 million credit facility (the Bridge Facility\u201d) provided by Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch ( Deutsche Bank\u201d). On March 11, 2014, we completed our initial public offering and sold 9,840,665 shares of common stock (including 1,250,000 shares of common stock through the underwriters' exercise of their overallotment option and the concurrent private placement of 257,332 shares of common stock to our Adviser's senior team and other persons associated with TPC) of our common stock at an offering price of $15.00 per share. We received $141.6 million of net proceeds in connection with the initial public offering and concurrent private placement, net of the portion of the underwriting sales load and offering costs we paid. We used a portion of these net proceeds to pay down all amounts outstanding under the Bridge Facility and terminated the Bridge Facility in conjunction with such repayment.\nIn February 2014, we entered into a credit agreement with Deutsche Bank acting as administrative agent and a lender, and KeyBank National Association, Everbank Commercial Lender Finance, Inc., and AloStar Bank of Commerce, as other lenders, which provided us with a $150.0 million commitment, subject to borrowing base\nrequirements ( Credit Facility\u201d). In August 2014, we amended the Credit Facility to increase the total commitments by $50.0 million to $200.0 million in aggregate. Effective as of a January 2016 amendment to the Credit Facility, borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at the sum of (i) the commercial paper rate for certain specified lenders and 30-day LIBOR for other lenders or, if LIBOR is unavailable, the higher of Deutsche Bank's commercial lending rate or the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50% plus (ii) a margin of 3.0% during the Credit Facility's revolving period. The revolving period under the amended Credit Facility expires in February 2018.\nOn March 27, 2015, we priced a public offering of 6,500,000 shares of our common stock, raising approximately $93.7 million after offering costs. On April 29, 2015, we received an additional approximately $2.2 million through the issuance of 154,018 shares of our common stock as the result of the underwriters' partial exercise of their overallotment option.\nOn August 4, 2015, we completed a public offering of $50.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2020 Notes and received net proceeds of $48.3 million after the payment of fees and offering costs. The interest on the 2020 Notes is payable quarterly on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15, beginning on October 15, 2015. On September 2, 2015, we issued an additional $4.6 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2020 Notes and received net proceeds of approximately $4.5 million, after the payment of the underwriting sales load and offering costs, as a result of the underwriters' partial exercise of their option to purchase additional 2020 Notes.\nPortfolio Composition, Investment Activity and Asset Quality\nPortfolio Composition\nWe originate and invest primarily in venture growth stage companies. Companies at the venture growth stage have distinct characteristics differentiating them from venture capital-backed companies at other stages in their development lifecycle. We invest primarily in (i) growth capital loans that have a secured collateral position and that are used by venture growth stage companies to finance their continued expansion and growth, (ii) equipment financings, which may be structured as loans or leases, that have a secured collateral position on specified mission-critical equipment, (iii) on a select basis, revolving loans that have a secured collateral position and that are used by venture growth stage companies to advance against inventory, components, accounts receivable, contractual or future billings, bookings, revenues, sales or cash payments and collections including proceeds from a sale, financing or the equivalent and (iv) direct equity investments in venture growth stage companies. In connection with our growth capital loans, equipment financings and revolving loans, we generally receive warrants that allow us to participate in any equity appreciation of our borrowers and enhance our overall investment returns.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had 85 investments in 34 companies and our four largest portfolio companies represented approximately 43.7% of our portfolio investments. Our investments included 47 debt investments, 31 warrant investments, and seven direct equity investments. The total cost and fair value of these investments were approximately $276.4 million and approximately $271.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, two of our customers were publicly traded. At December 31, 2015, the 47 debt investments with an aggregate fair value of approximately $259.6 million had a weighted average loan to enterprise value at the time of underwriting ratio of approximately 19.2%. Enterprise value of the borrower is estimated based on information available, including any information regarding the most recent rounds of borrower funding. Excluding the debt investment to Intermodal Data, Inc. (due to its foreclosure agreement to purchase certain assets and assume the outstanding obligations - see further discussion in Asset Quality\u201d section), the weighted average loan to enterprise value at the time of underwriting ratio was approximately 8.6%.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had 76 investments in 27 companies. Our investments included 46 debt investments, 26 warrant investments, and four direct equity investments. The total cost and fair value of these investments were approximately $256.5 million and approximately $258.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, one of our customers was publicly traded. At December 31, 2014, the 46 debt investments with an aggregate fair value of approximately $247.6 million had a weighted average loan to enterprise value at the time of underwriting ratio of approximately 9.1%.\nThe following tables provide information on the cost, fair value, and net unrealized gains (losses) of our investments in companies along with the number of companies in our portfolio as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nTable 279: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investments by Type\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Unrealized\n(Losses) Gains\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Number of\nInvestments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Number of\nCompanies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 265,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 259,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5,721\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Warrants\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Investments in Portfolio Companies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 276,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 271,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (4,635\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 280: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investments by Type\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Unrealized\nGains\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Number of\nInvestments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Number of\nCompanies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 247,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 247,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Warrants\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Investments in Portfolio Companies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 256,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 257,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n * Represents non-duplicative number of companies. \nThe following tables show the fair value of the portfolio of investments, by industry and the percentage of the total investment portfolio, as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nTable 282: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investments in Portfolio Companies by Industry\n(dollars in thousands)\u200d\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> At Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage of Total\nInvestments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Database Software\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 42,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> E-Commerce -

During the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014, we entered into fifteen new commitments with eleven new customers and four existing customers totaling $269.5 million, we funded 32 debt investments for approximately $159.4 million in principal balance, acquired warrants representing approximately $3.5 million of value, and made two equity investments totaling approximately $0.5 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we had prepayments from six of our portfolio companies for approximately $73.4 million in principal value. During the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014, we had prepayments from two of our portfolio companies for approximately $27.7 million in principal value.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our unfunded commitments to twelve companies totaled approximately $190.0 million; as of December 31, 2014, our unfunded commitments to eleven companies totaled $211.0 million.

Since these commitments may expire without being drawn upon, unfunded commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements or future earning assets for the Company. We generally expect approximately 75% of our gross unfunded commitments to eventually be drawn before the expiration of their corresponding availability periods.\nThe fair value at the inception of the agreement of the delay draw credit agreements with our customers is equal to the fees and/or warrants received to enter into these agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties' credit profile. The unfunded commitment liability reflects the fair value of these future funding commitments. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the fair value for these unfunded commitments totaled approximately $1.1 million and $2.1 million, respectively, and was included in other accrued expenses and liabilities\u201d in our consolidated statements of assets and liabilities.\nOur level of investment activity can vary substantially from period to period as our Adviser chooses to slow or accelerate new business originations depending on market conditions, rate of investment of TPC's select group of leading venture capital investors, our Adviser's knowledge, expertise and experience, our funding capacity\n(including availability under our credit facilities and our ability or inability to raise equity or debt capital), and other market dynamics.\nThe following table shows the debt commitments, fundings of debt investments (principal balance) and equity investments and non-binding term sheet activity for the year ended December 31, 2015 and for the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014.\nTable 288: <table> <tr> <td> Commitments and Fundings\nSince Acquisition of Initial Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Period From\nMarch 5, 2014\n(Commencement of\nOperations) to\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt Commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> New customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 144,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 232,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Existing customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Previous customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 213,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 269,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Funded Debt Investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 101,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 159,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity Investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-Binding Term Sheets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 427,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 445,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn December 31, 2015, we acquired $70.0 million in U.S. Treasury bills which were subsequently sold on January 5, 2016.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, there were five changes within the credit categories. One borrower with a principal balance of $5.0 million was upgraded from White (2) to Clear (1). One borrower with a principal balance of $6.9 million was downgraded from White (2) to Yellow (3). Two borrowers, Virtual Instruments Corporation with principal balance of $25.6 million and Mind Candy Limited with principal balance of $10.0 million, were downgraded from Yellow (3) to Orange (4). The other downgrade included the debt investments that were initially to Coraid, Inc., which were assumed by Intermodal Data, Inc. as part of the foreclosure agreement it entered into to purchase certain assets and assume the outstanding obligations owed to us. The debt investment to Intermodal Data, Inc. was ranked as Orange (4) as of December 31, 2015.\nDuring the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014, there were four changes within the credit categories.

Net investment income (loss) is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees and other investment income and our operating expenses including interest on borrowed funds. Net realized gains (losses) on investments are the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their amortized cost. Net unrealized gains (losses) on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio.\nSince we commenced operations on March 5, 2014, the results of operations for the period ended December 31, 2014 represents only 302 days of operations, as compared to 365 days for the year ended December 31, 2015, which accounts for most of the differences in operating results over these two periods.\nAs summarized in the table below, for the year ended December 31, 2015, our net increase in net assets resulting from operations was approximately $15.5 million, which was comprised of approximately $21.9 million of net investment income, partially offset by approximately $0.3 million of net realized losses and approximately $6.1 million of net change in unrealized losses. On a per share basis, net investment income was $1.46 per share and the net increase in net assets from operations was $1.03 per share. Our core net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately $21.6 million, or $1.44 per share. For the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014, our net increase in net assets resulting from operations was approximately $14.3 million, consisting of approximately $12.8 million in net investment income and approximately $1.5 million of net change in unrealized gains on investments. On a per share basis, net investment income was $1.30 per share and the net change in net assets from operations was $1.45 per share. Our core net investment income for the same period was approximately $13.1 million, or $1.33 per share.\nOur investment and other income increased by $16.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014 primarily due to the increase in average portfolio balance and higher prepayment activity in 2015. The year-over-year fluctuations were also due to the lower number of days of operations in 2014. Operating expenses also increased by $7.6 million during the same period for the following reasons: higher base management and incentive fees of $3.9 million due to higher asset balance and higher returns, higher interest expense of $2.4 million due to higher outstanding average balances and issuance of 2020 Notes in the third quarter of 2015, increase in general and administrative expenses of $0.9 million and administration agreement expenses of $0.4 million primarily due to the difference in number of days of operations in 2014. Net investment income and core net investment income increased during the same period for the reasons noted above.\nNet realized losses were approximately $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the losses on warrants of one portfolio company. There were no realized gains or losses during any period in 2014. Net change in unrealized losses during the year ended December 31, 2015, were $6.1 million as compared to a net change in unrealized gains of $1.5 million during the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to\nDecember 31, 2014. These have been discussed in more detail in the tables below.

Core net investment income, unlike GAAP net investment income, excludes accrued, but as yet unearned, capital gains incentive fee. We believe an important measure of the investment income that we will be required to distribute each year is core net investment income as capital gains incentive fee is accrued based on unrealized gains but are not earned until realized gains occur. Specifically, the capital gains component of the incentive fee is paid at the end of each calendar year and is 20.0% of our aggregate cumulative realized capital gains from commencement of operations through the end of the year, computed net of our aggregate cumulative realized capital losses and our aggregate cumulative unrealized losses through the end of such year. For the foregoing purpose, our aggregate cumulative realized capital gains\u201d does not include any unrealized gains. The capital gains component of the incentive fee is not subject to any minimum return to stockholders. For the year ended December 31, 2015 and the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014, no net capital gains were realized and thus no capital gains incentive fee was earned and was payable. During the same periods, we reported approximately $6.1 million in net change in unrealized losses and approximately $1.5 million in net change in unrealized gains, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015 we reversed previously accrued capital gains incentive fee of approximately $0.3 million. For the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014, we accrued approximately $0.3 million in capital gains incentive fee.\nTable 293: <table> <tr> <td> Net Investment Income and Core Net Investment Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Period from March 5, 2014 (Commencement of Operations) to\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Investment Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital gains incentive fee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (296\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Core Net Investment Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Investment Income per Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital gains incentive fee per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.02\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.03\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Core Net Investment Income per Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.33\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment income includes interest income on our debt investments utilizing the effective yield method and includes cash interest income as well as the amortization of purchase premium, accretion of purchase discount, original issue discount, facilities fees, and the amortization and payment of the end-of-term ( EOT\u201d) payments. For the year ended December 31, 2015 and for the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014, investment income totaled approximately $39.9 million and $24.7 million, respectively, representing a weighted average portfolio yield of approximately 17.0% and 15.4%, respectively, on debt investments for the periods held.\nWe calculate weighted average portfolio yields for periods shown as the annualized rates of the interest income recognized during the period divided by the average amortized cost of debt investments in the portfolio at the beginning of each month in the period. The weighted average yields reported for these periods are annualized and reflect the weighted average yields to maturities. Should the portfolio companies choose to repay their loans earlier, our weighted average yields will increase for those debt investments affected but may reduce our weighted average yields on the remaining portfolio in future quarters. As our portfolio grows and seasons, we expect our loans to be outstanding for shorter periods than to maturity and to reflect healthy prepayment activity.\nThe following table provides the weighted average portfolio yield on our portfolio comprising of cash interest income, accretion of the net purchase discount, facilities fees and the value of warrants received, accretion of EOT payments and the accelerated receipt of EOT payments on prepayments.\nTable 294: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Period from March 5, 2014 (Commencement of Operations) to\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Portfolio Yield (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average portfolio yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Coupon income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accretion of discount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accretion of end-of-term payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impact of prepayments during the\nperiod\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) The yields for periods shown are the annualized rates of interest income or the components of interest income recognized during the period divided by the average amortized cost of debt investments in the portfolio at the beginning of each month in the period. \nThe yield on our portfolio, excluding the impact of prepayments was approximately 15.4% and 14.5%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015 and for the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of\noperations) to December 31, 2014. The yields on our portfolio are dependent on fundings and the performance of our loans including prepayments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized approximately $2.2 million in other income consisting of approximately $1.8 million due to the termination or expiration of unfunded commitments and approximately $0.4 million from the realization of certain fees paid by companies and miscellaneous income. For the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014, we recognized approximately $0.7 million in other income consisting of approximately $0.4 million due to the termination or expiration of unfunded commitments and approximately $0.3 million from the realization of certain fees paid by companies and miscellaneous income.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, total operating expenses were approximately $20.1 million, comprising of approximately $9.5 million in base management and incentive fees, approximately $6.3 million in interest expense, approximately $1.5 million in administrative agreement expenses, and approximately $2.8 million in general and administrative expenses. For the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014, total operating expenses were approximately $12.5 million, comprising of approximately $5.6 million in base management and incentive fees, approximately $3.9 million in interest expense, approximately $1.1 million in administrative agreement expenses, and approximately $1.9 million in general and administrative expenses. In determining the base management fee, our Adviser had agreed to exclude the U.S. Treasury bill assets acquired at the end of the applicable quarters in 2015 and 2014 in the calculation of the gross assets. We anticipate operating expenses will increase over time as our portfolio continues to grow. However, we anticipate operating expenses, as a percentage of totals assets and net assets, will decrease over time as our portfolio and capital base grow. We expect base management and income incentive fees will increase as we grow our asset base and our earnings. Capital gains incentive fee will depend on realized and unrealized gains and losses. Interest expense will increase as we utilize more of our Credit Facility, and we expect fees per the administrative agreement and general and administrative agreements will increase to meet the additional requirements associated with servicing a larger portfolio.\nThere were $0.3 million of realized losses during the year ended December 31, 2015 and no realized gains or losses for the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014.\nThe table below summarizes our net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments, which was primarily due to changes discount rates used to determine fair value. Net change in unrealized gains (losses) in subsequent periods may be volatile as it depends on changes in the market, changes in the underlying performance of our portfolio companies and their respective industries, and many other factors.\nTable 296: <table> <tr> <td> Net Change in Unrealized Gains (Losses)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For

liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. In addition to the discussion below, we describe our critical accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nValuation of Investments\nWe measure the value of our investments at fair value in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure, or ASC Topic 820,\u201d issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB.\u201d Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nThe Valuation Committee of the Board is responsible for assisting the Board in valuing investments that are not publicly traded or for which current market values are not readily available. Investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued using market quotations, which are generally obtained from independent pricing services, broker-dealers or market makers. With respect to portfolio investments for which market quotations\nare not readily available, the Board, with the assistance of the Adviser and its senior investment team and independent valuation agents, is responsible for determining, in good faith, the fair value in accordance with the valuation policy approved by the Board. If more than one valuation method is used to measure fair value, the results are evaluated and weighted, as appropriate, considering the reasonableness of the range indicated by those results. The Adviser considers a range of fair values based upon the valuation techniques utilized and generally selects a value within that range that most represents fair value based on current market conditions as well as other factors the Adviser's senior investment team considers relevant. The Board makes this fair value determination on at least a quarterly basis or at such other times when the Board feels it would be appropriate to do so given the circumstances. A determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates and depends on the facts and circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of portfolio investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material.\nASC Topic 820 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. ASC Topic 820 also provides guidance regarding a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings and provides for enhanced disclosures determined by the level within the hierarchy of information used in the valuation. In accordance with ASC Topic 820, these inputs are summarized in the three levels listed below.\nLevel 1-Valuations are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date.\nLevel 2-Valuations are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable.\nLevel 3-Valuations are based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models incorporating significant unobservable inputs, such as discounted cash flow models and other similar valuations techniques. The valuation of Level 3 assets and liabilities generally requires significant management judgment due to the inability to observe inputs to valuation.\nIn certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an investment's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of observable input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and it considers factors specific to the investment.\nUnder ASC 820, the fair value measurement also assumes that the transaction to sell an asset occurs in the principal market for the asset or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset, which may be a hypothetical market, and excludes transaction costs. The principal market for any asset is the market with the greatest volume and level of activity for such asset in which the reporting entity would or could sell or transfer the asset. In determining the principal market for an asset or liability, it is assumed that the reporting entity has access to such market as of the measurement date. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable and willing and able to transact.\nWith respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, the Board undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\n \u00b7 The quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the Adviser's professionals that are responsible for the portfolio investment; \n \u00b7 Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with the Adviser's senior investment team; \n \u00b7 The Valuation Committee then reviews these preliminary valuations and makes fair value recommendations to the Board; \n \u00b7 At least once annually, the valuation for each portfolio investment will be reviewed by an independent valuation firm. However, the Board does not intend to have de minimis investments of less than 1.0% of our gross assets (up to an aggregate of 10.0% of our gross assets) independently reviewed; and \n \u00b7 The Board then discusses valuations and determines, in good faith, the fair value of each investment in our portfolio based on the input of the Adviser, the respective independent valuation firms and the Valuation Committee. \nDebt Investments\nThe debt investments identified on the consolidated schedule of investments are loans and equipment financings made to venture growth stage companies focused in technology, life sciences and other high growth industries which are backed by a select group of leading venture capital investors. These investments are considered Level 3 assets under ASC Topic 820 because there is no known or accessible market or market indices for these types of debt instruments and thus the Adviser's senior management team must estimate the fair value of these investment securities based on models utilizing unobservable inputs.\nTo estimate the fair value of debt investments, we compare the cost basis of each debt investment, which includes original issue discount, to the resulting fair value determined using a discounted cash flow model, unless another model is more appropriate based on the circumstances at the measurement date. The discounted cash flow approach entails analyzing the interest rate spreads for recently completed financing transactions which are similar in nature to these debt investments, in order to determine a comparable range of effective market interest rates. The range of interest rate spreads utilized is based on borrowers with similar credit profiles. All remaining expected cash flows of the investment are discounted using this range of interest rates to determine a range of fair values for the debt investment.\nThis valuation process includes, among other things, evaluating the underlying investment performance and the portfolio company's current financial condition and ability to raise additional capital, as well as macro-economic events that may impact valuations. These events include, but are not limited to, current market yields and interest rate spreads of similar securities as of the measurement date. Changes in these unobservable inputs could result in significantly different fair value measurements.\nUnder certain circumstances, an alternative technique may be used to value certain debt investments that better reflected the fair value of the investment, such as the price paid or realized in a recently completed transaction or a binding offer received in an"}
