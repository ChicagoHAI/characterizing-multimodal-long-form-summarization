Our fine dining heritage and commitment to community building, hospitality and the sourcing of premium ingredients is what we call \"fine casual.\" Fine casual couples the ease, value and convenience of fast casual concepts with the high standards of excellence grounded in our fine dining heritage-thoughtful ingredient sourcing and preparation, hospitality and quality.\nOur mission is to Stand For Something Good in all aspects of our business, including the exceptional team we hire and train, the premium ingredients making up our menu, our community engagement and the design of our Shacks. Stand For Something Good is a call to action for all of our stakeholders-our team, guests, communities, suppliers and investors-and we actively invite them all to share in this philosophy with us. This commitment drives our integration into the local communities in which we operate and fosters a deep and lasting connection with our guests.\nFISCAL 2019 HIGHLIGHTS\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal 2019 was another strong year for Shake Shack in which we continued to execute upon our growth strategy by opening a record-breaking number of domestic company-operated Shacks, further expanded our licensed business both internationally and domestic, enhanced our infrastructure and support systems and kept focus on our digital strategy, specifically in rolling out our delivery partnership. We met our targeted growth plan and opened 39 domestic company-operated Shacks and we entered into the new markets of New Orleans, Salt Lake City and Columbus, as well as deepened our roots in our current markets across the country. Internationally, we expanded our footprint by opening 24 new licensed Shacks, which included our first Shack openings in Shanghai, Mexico City, Singapore and Manila. Additionally, we opened 10 domestic licensed Shacks, further supporting our licensed growth strategy with eight of those openings in airports across the country.\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 54\nWe further executed upon our commitment of putting our people first. To foster an inclusive and diverse work environment, we launched our All-In initiative across the entire organization. The All-In program works to provide equal opportunities for success, removing obstacles and fostering a culture of diversity, inclusion and empowerment. This program included a number of new initiatives, including a mentorship program, flexible work arrangement policy and the pilot of our 4-day workweek for Shack managers. We were proud to be named one of the \"Best places to work for LGBTQ+ Equality\" and earn a 100% score on the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index for our support of the LGBTQ+ community in the workplace.\nWe continued to innovate our menu throughout fiscal 2019 with exciting promotions and events, chef collaborations, LTOs and limited launches from our Innovation Kitchen. One of the biggest promotions we ran was in honor of the final season of Game of Throne where we launched our limited-edition #ForTheThrone menu. This promotion included our icy Dragonglass Shake and our Dracarys Burger, as well as offering limited edition shake cups at Shacks nationwide. We also featured a different shake each month throughout the year as well as a variety of lemonades. Additionally, we launched Chick'n Bites as an LTO and have since added to the core menu.\nFor the past couple of years we have participated in various delivery pilots with a number of partners. In 2019 we announced our national integrated partnership with Grubhub. We believe our partnership allows us to provide faster delivery, fresher food and a winning guest experience. We will also have access to enhanced tools to analyze performance and ordering trends to be able to connect with guests in new and more personalized ways, as well as engage in joint marketing initiatives that we believe will generate connections with new guests and drive order frequency for existing fans. We also ran our #SHACKUP campaign throughout the year in celebration of our new delivery partnership. This campaign featured an elevated Shake Shack experience highlighting key delivery moments, such as treat yourself, family dinner, date night, celebrating with friends and ordering for the office team.\nTo support our growth and rapid expansion we needed to enhance our infrastructure and support systems. We completed the first phase of our enterprise-wide system upgrade initiative, Project Concrete, in June 2019. In an effort to ensure our infrastructure and support systems are sufficiently robust and scalable to deliver upon our current and anticipated future growth opportunities, we made key investments in our core financial and operational systems, which included those supporting our finance, procure-to-pay, inventory and human capital management areas.\nOur success in these growth strategies resonated through our fiscal 2019 results. Some financial highlights for fiscal 2019 include:\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Total revenue increased 29.4% to $594.5 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Shack sales increased 29.0% to $574.6 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Same-Shack sales increased 1.3%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Licensed revenue increased 45.0% to $19.9 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Shack system-wide sales increased 33.2% to $895.3 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Operating income was $25.7 million, or 4.3% of total revenue, which included the impact of costs associated with Project Concrete and other one-time items totaling $2.4 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Shack-level operating profit*, a non-GAAP measure, increased 13.4% to $128.0 million, or 22.3% of Shack sales.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net income was $24.1 million and net income attributable to Shake Shack Inc. was $19.8 million, or $0.61 per diluted share.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Adjusted EBITDA*, a non-GAAP measure, increased 10.8% to $81.8 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Adjusted pro forma net income*, a non-GAAP measure, increased 1.7% to $27.4 million, or $0.72 per fully exchanged and diluted share.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>73 system-wide Shack openings, including 39 domestic company-operated Shacks and 34 licensed Shacks.

Form 10-K | 55\nWe plan to continue to expand our business, drive Shack sales and enhance our competitive positioning by executing on the following strategies: (i) opening new domestic company-operated Shacks; (ii) growing our licensed Shack business, both domestically and abroad; (iii) expanding and enhancing our guest experience; and (iv) capitalizing on our outsized brand awareness.\nOur primary means of growth continues to be opening new domestic company-operated Shacks, increasing our footprint in our existing markets as well as expanding into a select number of new ones. We continue to broaden our Shack formats to suit our new and existing markets, such formats include free-standing pads, airports, events, food trucks, digital focused, urban, stadium, shopping center, mall, food court and roadside. Our development strategy in fiscal 2020 focuses on further penetration of existing markets, complemented by launches in some new markets, including Indianapolis and Sacramento.\nAs we continue to grow, especially outside of New York City and other urban markets, we expect our company-wide average unit volume (\"AUV\") for all domestic company-operated Shacks to continue to decline over time as Shacks of various unit volumes are introduced into the system. Our historical AUVs have been higher, due in large part to our concentration in New York City and urban markets, and as such, historical domestic company-operated AUVs are not a good measure of expected sales at new Shacks. For fiscal 2020, we expect domestic company-operated AUV to be between $3.7 to $3.8 million.\nWe continue to devote attention to expanding our licensed business, both internationally and domestically, which we executed this year with 24 international licensed Shack and 10 domestic licensed Shack openings. We opened Shacks in four additional countries throughout the year, including: three Shacks in mainland China, two Shacks in the Philippines, two Shacks in Mexico and one Shack in Singapore. A meaningful part of our international business strategy remains focused in Asia. To further foster our growth in Asia, we opened our first international office in Hong Kong in 2019 to support the brand and day-to-day operations. Domestically, we have continued to grow our licensed business, especially in our presence at airport locations around the country, which have been an exciting layer of growth to our licensed strategy. Of the 10 domestic licensed locations we opened in 2019, eight were in airports across the country. For further details around financial information about geographic areas, see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8.\nWe remain focused on expanding and enhancing our guest experience, which we strive to do so through the community gathering places we create, menu innovation and the digital space. We plan to execute on this strategy by:\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Continuing to expand our Shacks through a variety of formats and gaining market share. Though our base is heavily weighted toward free-standing pads, and we plan on building many more of those, we are also looking to expand our footprint with our other formats, including: airports, events, food trucks, digital focused, urban, stadium, shopping center, mall, food court and roadside.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Creating buzz-worthy LTOs, innovating our core menu and looking towards new menu categories in fiscal 2020, which includes bringing back some guest favorites like the ShackMeister Burger and Hot Chick'n, as well as adding Hot Chick'n Bites.

As part of our digital expansion, we are working to redesign the full web experience, which encompasses everything from ordering on the app or your desktop, at the Shack or via Grubhub.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe first phase of our enterprise-wide systems upgrade initiative, Project Concrete, was completed in June 2019 and we plan on continuing the next phase in fiscal 2020. Given our expected growth of between 40 to 42 Shacks to open in fiscal 2020, and digital expansion over the past year, we recognize that it is essential for our infrastructure and support systems to be sufficiently robust and scalable to deliver upon our anticipated future growth opportunities. We will be focusing on our operational and back-office systems during this phase of the initiative and continuing in making those key investments necessary to reduce the administrative tasks in the Shacks.\nWhile we believe there are significant opportunities ahead of us, we also face many challenges, along with our industry, particularly around labor and related expenses, our digital expansion and geopolitical factors.\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We expect the high labor cost trends to continue into fiscal 2020, as we have seen for the last couple of years. We believe that rising minimum wage legislation and a competitive and low unemployment labor market will continue to affect the restaurant industry and with significant mandatory increases in both minimum wages and salaries in many of our key markets. Additionally, we have seen increased regulatory pressures, such as the Fair Workweek legislation in New York City, with similar legislation proposed in other jurisdictions as well, including Philadelphia and Chicago in fiscal 2020. Several states in which we operate have enacted minimum wage increases and it is possible that other states or the federal government could also enact minimum\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 56\nwage increases. Our primary challenge for fiscal 2020 and the next few years will be preserving our margins in the face of these rising labor costs. As more minimum wage increases are enacted, we may be required to implement additional pay increases or offer additional benefits in the future in order to attract and retain the most qualified people, which we expect to put further pressure on our operating margins. In addition to recruiting the most qualified people, we are committed to retaining our employees and will continue to evolve training, compensation and benefits to do so, for example, by extending our equity-based compensation program to general managers.\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>As we have described throughout our growth strategies, the digital space is a key area of focus for us and we are continuing to evolve in it. Digital touches upon almost every aspect of our guest experience, so it is crucial for us to understand our guest behaviors and remain competitive in the industry. For example, our delivery partnership with Grubhub was launched in 2019 and will take some time for us to evaluate and apply the insights we will learn through the guest data we retrieve.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In fiscal 2019 we further expanded internationally by opening our first Shacks in mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, the Philippines and Mexico. As with any international Shack, there remains risk due to political and economicl uncertainties. Specifically, due to the geopolitical factors in Hong Kong, we expect to see some impact due to closures from time to time. Additionally, with the onset of the coronavirus outbreak in China and the World Health Organization's declaration of its global health emergency, we would also expect to see lower traffic in the impacted areas and potentially beyond.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We expect our operating profit to increase in absolute terms and our margin to begin to stabilize in 2020 compared to the contraction seen over the past few years.\nWith 275 Shacks system-wide as of December 25, 2019, we remain excited for the new opportunities ahead of us, both domestically and abroad.

Form 10-K | 59\nShack Sales\nShack sales represent the aggregate sales of food, beverages and Shake Shack branded merchandise at our domestic company-operated Shacks. Shack sales in any period are directly influenced by the number of operating weeks in such period, the number of open Shacks and same-Shack sales. Same-Shack sales means, for any reporting period, sales for the comparable Shack base, which we define as the number of domestic company-operated Shacks open for 24 full fiscal months or longer.\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollar amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shack sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>574,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>445,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>346,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>96.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Dollar change compared to prior year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>129,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Percentage change compared to prior year\n</td> <td>29.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in Shack sales for fiscal 2019 is primarily driven by the opening of 39 new domestic company-operated Shacks and a same-Shack sales increase of 1.3%, which was approximately $4.3 million of the total increase in Shack sales. The same-Shack sales increase was primarily driven by a combined increase of 1.8% in price and sales mix partially offset by decreased guest traffic of 0.5%. For purposes of calculating same-Shack sales growth, Shack sales for 85 Shacks were included in the comparable Shack base. AUVs for domestic company-operated Shacks decreased to $4.1 million in fiscal 2019 from $4.4 million in fiscal 2018, primarily due to the addition of Shacks with lower unit volumes to the system.\nThe increase in Shack sales for fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by the opening of 34 new domestic company-operated Shacks and a same-Shack sales increase of 1.0%, which was approximately $2.5 million of the total increase in Shack sales.

For purposes of calculating same-Shack sales growth, Shack sales for 61 Shacks were included in the comparable Shack base. AUVs for domestic company-operated Shacks decreased to $4.4 million in fiscal 2018 from $4.6 million in fiscal 2017, primarily due to the addition of Shacks with lower unit volumes to the system.\nLicensing Revenue\nOn December 28, 2017, we adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Results for reporting periods beginning on or after December 28, 2017 are presented under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 (\"ASC 606\"). Prior period amounts were not revised and continue to be reported in accordance with ASC Topic 605 (\"ASC 605\"), the accounting standard then in effect. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for more information.\nLicensing revenue is comprised of sales-based royalty fees and amortization of certain upfront fees, including opening fees for certain licensed Shacks and initial territory fees received for the exclusive right to develop Shacks in a specific geographic area. Prior to the adoption of ASC 606, opening fees were typically recognized as revenue when a licensed Shack opened and territory fees were recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the license agreement.\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollar amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Licensing revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Dollar change compared to prior year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Percentage change compared to prior year\n</td> <td>45.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in licensing revenue for fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by the opening of 28 net licensed Shacks during the fiscal year and the strong performance of Shacks that opened in the new markets of Shanghai, Mexico City, Singapore and Manila.\nThis increase in licensing revenue for 2018 was primarily driven by the opening of 15 licensed Shacks during the fiscal year and strong performance in Asia, including the initial strength of newer Shacks in Hong Kong and Japan.\nShake Shack Inc.

The increase in food and paper costs as a percentage of Shack sales for fiscal 2019 was driven by a higher cost profile of Chick'n Bites, which launched in January 2019; significant commodity inflation in beef and some inflation with dairy; and an increase in paper costs, as a direct result of digital sales mix, which comes with additional packaging.\nThe increase in food and paper costs for fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the opening of 34 new domestic company-operated Shacks during the fiscal year. The decrease in food and paper costs as a percentage of Shack sales for fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the menu price increase we implemented in December 2017, sponsorship receipts for our biennial leadership retreat and costs associated with the free burger promotion in fiscal 2017 related to the launch of our mobile app that did not exist in fiscal 2018.\nLabor and Related Expenses\nLabor and related expenses include domestic company-operated Shack-level hourly and management wages, bonuses, payroll taxes, equity-based compensation, workers' compensation expense and medical benefits. As we expect with other variable expense items, we expect labor costs to grow as our Shack sales grow. Factors that influence labor costs include minimum wage and payroll tax legislation, health care costs and the performance of our domestic company-operated Shacks.\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollar amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Labor and related expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>160,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>122,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91,740\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of Shack sales\n</td> <td>28.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Dollar change compared to prior year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Percentage change compared to prior year\n</td> <td>31.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in labor and related expenses for fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the opening of 39 new domestic company-operated Shacks during the fiscal year.

All such costs incurred prior to the opening of a domestic company-operated Shack are expensed in the period in which the expense is incurred. Pre-opening costs can fluctuate significantly from period to period, based on the number and timing of domestic company-operated Shack openings and the specific pre-opening costs recognized for each domestic company-operated Shack. Additionally, domestic company-operated Shack openings in new geographic market areas will initially experience higher pre-opening costs than our established geographic market areas, such as the New York City metropolitan area, where we have greater economies of scale and typically incur lower travel and lodging costs for our training team.\nShake Shack Inc.

Any taxable income or loss generated by SSE Holdings is passed through to and included in the taxable income or loss of its members, including us, on a pro rata basis.

Our weighted-average ownership interest in SSE Holdings increased to 84.1% in fiscal 2019 from 76.6% in 2018. Our effective income tax rate decreased to 12.3% in fiscal 2019 from 28.8% in fiscal 2018 primarily due to the aforementioned items.\nThe decrease in income tax expense for fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by the remeasurement of the deferred tax assets in fiscal 2017 made in connection with the enactment of the TCJA, which resulted in $138.6 million of additional income tax expense, which was partially offset by an increase in our ownership interest in SSE Holdings. As our ownership interest in SSE Holdings increases, our share of the taxable income of SSE Holdings also increases.

Accordingly, we consolidate the financial results of SSE Holdings and report a non-controlling interest on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss), representing the portion of net income attributable to the other members of SSE Holdings. The SSE Holdings LLC Agreement provides that holders of LLC Interests may, from time to time, require SSE Holdings to redeem all or a portion of their LLC Interests for newly-issued shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. In connection with any redemption or exchange, we receive a corresponding number of LLC Interests, increasing our total ownership interest in SSE Holdings. The weighted average ownership percentages for the applicable reporting periods are used to attribute net income and other comprehensive income to Shake Shack Inc. and the non-controlling interest holders.\nShake Shack Inc.

Additionally, Shack-level operating profit and Shack-level operating profit margin are key metrics used internally by our management to develop internal budgets and forecasts, as well as assess the performance of our Shacks relative to budget and against prior periods. It is also used to evaluate employee compensation as it serves as a metric in certain of our performance-based employee bonus arrangements. We believe presentation of Shack-level operating profit and Shack-level operating profit margin provides investors with a supplemental view of our operating performance that can provide meaningful insights to the underlying operating performance of our Shacks, as these measures depict the operating results that are directly impacted by our Shacks and exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, the ongoing operations of our Shacks. It may also assist investors to evaluate our performance relative to peers of various sizes and maturities and provides greater transparency with respect to how our management evaluates our business, as well as our financial and operational decision-making.\nLimitations of the Usefulness of this Measure\nShack-level operating profit and Shack-level operating profit margin may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation. Presentation of Shack-level operating profit and Shack-level operating profit margin is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Shack-level operating profit excludes certain costs, such as general and administrative expenses and pre-opening costs, which are considered normal, recurring cash operating expenses and are essential to support the operation and development of our Shacks. Therefore, this measure may not provide a complete understanding of the operating results of our company as a whole and Shack-level operating profit and Shack-level operating profit margin should be reviewed in conjunction with our GAAP financial results.

Adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share is calculated by dividing adjusted pro forma net income by the weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding, assuming the full exchange of all outstanding LLC Interests, after giving effect to the dilutive effect of outstanding equity-based awards.\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 68\nHow These Measures Are Useful\nWhen used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, adjusted pro forma net income and adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share are supplemental measures of operating performance that we believe are useful measures to evaluate our performance period over period and relative to our competitors. By assuming the full exchange of all outstanding LLC Interests, we believe these measures facilitate comparisons with other companies that have different organizational and tax structures, as well as comparisons period over period because it eliminates the effect of any changes in net income attributable to Shake Shack Inc. driven by increases in our ownership of SSE Holdings, which are unrelated to our operating performance, and excludes items that are non-recurring or may not be indicative of our ongoing operating performance.\nLimitations of the Usefulness of These Measures\nAdjusted pro forma net income and adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation. Presentation of adjusted pro forma net income and adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share, as determined under GAAP. While these measures are useful in evaluating our performance, it does not account for the earnings attributable to the non-controlling interest holders and therefore does not provide a complete understanding of the net income attributable to Shake Shack Inc. Adjusted pro forma net income and adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share should be evaluated in conjunction with our GAAP financial results. A reconciliation of adjusted pro forma net income to net income (loss) attributable to Shake Shack Inc., the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and the computation of adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share are set forth below.\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

As of December 25, 2019, we maintained a cash and cash equivalents balance of $37.1 million, a short-term investments balance of $36.5 million and had $50.0 million of availability under our revolving credit facility.\nOur primary requirements for liquidity are to fund our working capital needs, operating and finance lease obligations, capital expenditures and general corporate needs. Our requirements for working capital are not significant because our guests pay for their food and beverage purchases in cash or on debit or credit cards at the time of the sale and we are able to sell many of our inventory items before payment is due to the supplier of such items. Our ongoing capital expenditures are principally related to opening new Shacks, existing Shack capital investments (both for remodels and maintenance), as well as investments in our corporate infrastructure.\nIn addition, we are obligated to make payments to the non-controlling interest holders under the Tax Receivable Agreement. As of December 25, 2019, such obligations totaled $234.4 million, of which $7.8 million is expected to be paid in fiscal 2020. Amounts payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement are contingent upon, among other things, (i) generation of future taxable income over the term of the Tax Receivable Agreement and (ii) future changes in tax laws. If we do not generate sufficient taxable income in the aggregate over the term of the Tax Receivable Agreement to utilize the tax benefits, then we would not be required to make the related TRA Payments. Although the amount of any payments that must be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be significant, the timing of these payments will vary and will generally be limited to one payment per member per year. The amount of such payments are also limited to the extent we utilize the related deferred tax assets. The payments that we are required to make will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us or to SSE Holdings, but we expect the cash tax savings we will realize from the utilization of the related deferred tax assets to fund the required payments.\nWe believe that cash provided by operating activities, cash on hand and availability under the Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our operating and finance lease obligations, capital expenditures, tax receivable agreement obligations and working capital needs for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future.\nSummary of Cash Flows\nThe following table and discussion presents, for the periods indicated, a summary of our key cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(80,686\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(86,604\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(61,943\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>3,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>965\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>12,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period\n</td> <td>24,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents at end of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nFor fiscal 2019, net cash provided by operating activities was $89.9 million compared to $85.4 million for fiscal 2018, an increase of $4.5 million. This increase was primarily driven by the opening of 39 new domestic company-operated Shacks during fiscal 2019, offset by spending related to our foundational infrastructure upgrades to support our ongoing growth initiatives.\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 71\nFor fiscal 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $85.4 million compared to $70.9 million for fiscal 2017, an increase of $14.5 million. This increase was primarily driven by the opening of 34 new domestic company-operated Shacks during fiscal 2018.\nInvesting Activities\nFor fiscal 2019, net cash used in investing activities was $80.7 million compared to $86.6 million for fiscal 2018, a decrease of $5.9 million. This decrease primarily relates to an increase of $25.0 million of proceeds from sales of marketable securities offset by an increase in capital expenditures of $19.0 million to construct new domestic company-operated Shacks compared to fiscal 2018.\nFor fiscal 2018, net cash used in investing activities was $86.6 million compared to $61.9 million for fiscal 2017, an increase of $24.7 million. This increase primarily relates to an increase in capital expenditures of $26.0 million to construct new domestic company-operated Shacks compared to fiscal 2017.\nFinancing Activities\nFor fiscal 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $3.2 million compared to $4.5 million for fiscal 2018, a decrease of $1.3 million. This decrease is primarily due to an increase of $1.0 million in distributions to non-controlling interest holders, $0.7 million of payments related to the TRA and principal payments on financing leases offset by an increase in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options.\nFor fiscal 2018, net cash provided by financing activities was $4.5 million compared to $1.0 million for fiscal 2017, an increase of $3.5 million. This increase is primarily due to a reduction in financing cash outflows of $1.6 million in distributions to non-controlling interest holders and $4.8 million of payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement in fiscal 2017 that did not exist in fiscal 2018, offset by a decrease of $2.1 million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nWe maintain a Credit Agreement that provides for a revolving credit facility of $50.0 million, of which the entire commitment is available immediately, with the ability to increase available borrowings up to an additional $100 million, to be made available subject to certain conditions. The Credit Agreement will mature and all amounts outstanding will be due and payable in August 2024 and permits the issuance of letters of credit upon our request of up to $15.0 million. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at either: (i) LIBOR plus a percentage ranging from 1.0% to 1.5% or (ii) the base rate plus a percentage ranging from 0.0% to 0.5%, in each case depending on our net lease adjusted leverage ratio. To the extent the LIBOR reference rate is no longer available, the administrative agent, in consultation with us, will determine a replacement rate which will be generally in accordance with similar transactions in which it serves as administrative agent. We have $50.0 million of availability as of December 25, 2019.\nThe obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of SSE Holdings and the guarantors. The obligations under the Credit Agreement were guaranteed by each of SSE Holdings' direct and indirect subsidiaries (with certain exceptions).\nThe Credit Agreement requires us to comply with maximum net lease adjusted leverage and minimum fixed charge coverage ratios. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains other customary affirmative and negative covenants, including those which (subject to certain exceptions and dollar thresholds) limit our ability to incur debt; incur liens; make investments; engage in mergers, consolidations, liquidations or acquisitions; dispose of assets; make distributions on or repurchase equity securities; engage in transactions with affiliates; and prohibits us, with certain exceptions, from engaging in any line of business not related to our current line of business. As of December 25, 2019, we were in compliance with all covenants.\nShake Shack Inc.

Form 10-K | 73\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclose contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis.\nThe critical accounting policies and estimates described below are those that materially affect or have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments made by management. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results may differ from those estimates we use in applying our critical accounting policies and estimates. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nProperty and Equipment\nWe assess potential impairments to our long-lived assets, which includes property and equipment and operating lease assets, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of an asset is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is primarily at the individual Shack level. Significant judgment is involved in determining the assumptions used in estimating future cash flows, including projected sales growth and operating margins. If the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. There were no impairment charges recorded during fiscal 2019, 2018 or 2017.\nLeases\nOn December 27, 2018 we adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), using a modified retrospective approach. Refer to Note 10 Leases for further details.\nWe currently lease all of our domestic company-operated Shacks, our Home Office, and certain equipment under various non-cancelable lease agreements that expire on various dates through 2035. Upon the possession of a leased asset, we determine its classification as an operating or financing lease. Most of our real estate leases are classified as operating leases and most of our equipment leases are classified as finance leases.\nWe make judgments regarding the probable term for each lease, which can impact the classification and accounting for a lease as financing or operating, as well as the amount of straight-lined rent expense in a particular period. Typically, our real estate leases have initial terms ranging from 10 to 15 years and include multiple five-year renewal options. Renewal options are generally not included in the lease term as it is not reasonably certain at commencement date that we would exercise the options to extend the lease.\nOur real estate leases typically provide for fixed minimum rent payments and/or contingent rent payments based upon sales in excess of specified thresholds. When the achievement of such sales thresholds are deemed to be probable, contingent rent is accrued in proportion to the sales recognized during the period. Fixed minimum rent payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term starting on the date we take possession of the leased property. Lease expense incurred before a Shack opens is recorded in pre-opening costs. Once a Shack opens, we record the straight-line lease expense and any contingent rent, if applicable, in occupancy and related expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Many of our leases also require us to pay real estate taxes, common area maintenance costs and other occupancy costs which are included in occupancy and related expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nWe make judgments in determining the appropriate discount rate used to measure the lease liability. Given there are no explicit rates provided in our leases, we use our incremental borrowing rate ( IBR\u201d). The IBR is derived from the average of the yield curves obtained from using the notching method and the recovery rate method. The most significant assumption in calculating the incremental\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 74\nborrowing rate is our credit rating. We determined our credit rating based on a comparison of the financial information of SSE Holdings to other public companies and then used their respective credit ratings to develop our own.\nWe expend cash for leasehold improvements and to build out and equip our leased premises. Generally, a portion of the leasehold improvements and building costs are reimbursed to us by our landlords as construction contributions pursuant to agreed-upon terms in our leases. If obtained, landlord construction contributions usually take the form of cash, full or partial credits against our future minimum or percentage rents otherwise payable by us, or a combination thereof. In most cases, landlord incentives are received after we take possession of the property, as we meet required milestones during the construction of the property. We include these amounts in the measurement of the initial operating lease liability, which are also reflected as a reduction to the initial measurement of the right-of-use asset.\nSelf-Insurance Liabilities\nWe are self-insured for our employee medical and dental plans and we recognize a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is based on a number of assumptions and factors, which requires significant judgment including historical claims experience, severity factors, litigation costs, inflation and other actuarial assumptions. Our history of claims experience is short and our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of our estimates. If a greater amount of claims are reported, or if medical costs increase beyond our expectations, our liabilities may not be sufficient and we could recognize additional expense.\nEquity-Based Compensation\nEquity-based compensation expense is measured based on fair value. For awards with graded-vesting features and service conditions only, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the total requisite service period for the entire award. For awards with graded-vesting features and a combination of service and performance conditions, compensation expense is recognized using a graded-vesting attribution method over the vesting period based on the most probable outcome of the performance conditions. We determine the probability of achievement of future performance conditions based on our internal estimates of future performance, and we account for forfeitures as they occur. We estimate the grant date fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Calculating the grant date fair value of stock-based awards is based on certain assumptions and requires judgment, including estimating stock price volatility, and expected life. We have limited historical data of our own to utilize in determining our assumptions. As such, for stock options granted in fiscal 2019 and 2018, we based our volatility assumption on a combined weighted average of our own historical data and that of a selected peer group. The weighted-average volatility used in determining the grant date fair value of awards granted in fiscal 2019 and 2018 was 42.2% and 42.5%, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nWe record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. We routinely evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered based on all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, estimates of future taxable income, tax planning strategies and results of operations. Estimating future taxable income is inherently uncertain and requires judgment. In projecting future taxable income, we consider our historical results and incorporate certain assumptions, including projected Shack openings, revenue growth, and operating margins, among others. As of December 25, 2019, we had $279.8 million of deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances. We expect to realize future tax benefits related to the utilization of these assets. If we determine in the future that we will not be able to fully utilize all or part of these deferred tax assets, we would record a valuation allowance through earnings in the period the determination was made, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and earnings in future periods.\nLiabilities Under Tax Receivable Agreement\nAs described in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, we are a party to the Tax Receivable Agreement under which we are contractually committed to pay the non-controlling interest holders 85% of the amount of any tax benefits that we actually realize, or in some cases are deemed to realize, as a result of certain transactions. Amounts payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement are contingent upon, among other things, (i) generation of future taxable income over the term of the Tax Receivable Agreement and (ii) future changes in tax laws. If we do not generate sufficient taxable income in the aggregate over the\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 75\nterm of the Tax Receivable Agreement to utilize the tax benefits, then we would not be required to make the related TRA Payments. Therefore, we would only recognize a liability for TRA Payments if we determine it is probable that we will generate sufficient future taxable income over the term of the Tax Receivable Agreement to utilize the related tax benefits. Estimating future taxable income is inherently uncertain and requires judgment. In projecting future taxable income, we consider our historical results and incorporate certain assumptions, including projected Shack openings, revenue growth, and operating margins, among others. During fiscal 2019, as a result of the redemptions of LLC Interests, we recognized liabilities totaling $234.4 million relating to our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement, after concluding that it was probable that we would have sufficient future taxable income to utilize the related tax benefits. If we determine in the future that we will not be able to fully utilize all or part of the related tax benefits, we would derecognize the portion of the liability related the benefits not expected to be utilized.\nAdditionally, we estimate the amount of TRA Payments expected to be paid within the next 12 months and classify this amount as current on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. This determination is based on our estimate of taxable income for the next fiscal year. To the extent our estimate differs from actual results, we may be required to reclassify portions of our liabilities under the Tax Receivable Agreement between current and non-current.\nShake Shack Inc.

Our fine dining heritage and commitment to community building, hospitality and the sourcing of premium ingredients is what we call \"fine casual.\" Fine casual couples the ease, value and convenience of fast casual concepts with the high standards of excellence grounded in our fine dining heritage-thoughtful ingredient sourcing and preparation, hospitality and quality.\nOur mission is to Stand For Something Good in all aspects of our business, including the exceptional team we hire and train, the premium ingredients making up our menu, our community engagement and the design of our Shacks. Stand For Something Good is a call to action for all of our stakeholders-our team, guests, communities, suppliers and investors-and we actively invite them all to share in this philosophy with us. This commitment drives our integration into the local communities in which we operate and fosters a deep and lasting connection with our guests.\nFISCAL 2019 HIGHLIGHTS\n \nFiscal 2019 was another strong year for Shake Shack in which we continued to execute upon our growth strategy by opening a record-breaking number of domestic company-operated Shacks, further expanded our licensed business both internationally and domestic, enhanced our infrastructure and support systems and kept focus on our digital strategy, specifically in rolling out our delivery partnership. We met our targeted growth plan and opened 39 domestic company-operated Shacks and we entered into the new markets of New Orleans, Salt Lake City and Columbus, as well as deepened our roots in our current markets across the country. Internationally, we expanded our footprint by opening 24 new licensed Shacks, which included our first Shack openings in Shanghai, Mexico City, Singapore and Manila. Additionally, we opened 10 domestic licensed Shacks, further supporting our licensed growth strategy with eight of those openings in airports across the country.\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 54\nWe further executed upon our commitment of putting our people first. To foster an inclusive and diverse work environment, we launched our All-In initiative across the entire organization. The All-In program works to provide equal opportunities for success, removing obstacles and fostering a culture of diversity, inclusion and empowerment. This program included a number of new initiatives, including a mentorship program, flexible work arrangement policy and the pilot of our 4-day workweek for Shack managers. We were proud to be named one of the \"Best places to work for LGBTQ+ Equality\" and earn a 100% score on the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index for our support of the LGBTQ+ community in the workplace.\nWe continued to innovate our menu throughout fiscal 2019 with exciting promotions and events, chef collaborations, LTOs and limited launches from our Innovation Kitchen. One of the biggest promotions we ran was in honor of the final season of Game of Throne where we launched our limited-edition #ForTheThrone menu. This promotion included our icy Dragonglass Shake and our Dracarys Burger, as well as offering limited edition shake cups at Shacks nationwide. We also featured a different shake each month throughout the year as well as a variety of lemonades. Additionally, we launched Chick'n Bites as an LTO and have since added to the core menu.\nFor the past couple of years we have participated in various delivery pilots with a number of partners. In 2019 we announced our national integrated partnership with Grubhub. We believe our partnership allows us to provide faster delivery, fresher food and a winning guest experience. We will also have access to enhanced tools to analyze performance and ordering trends to be able to connect with guests in new and more personalized ways, as well as engage in joint marketing initiatives that we believe will generate connections with new guests and drive order frequency for existing fans. We also ran our #SHACKUP campaign throughout the year in celebration of our new delivery partnership. This campaign featured an elevated Shake Shack experience highlighting key delivery moments, such as treat yourself, family dinner, date night, celebrating with friends and ordering for the office team.\nTo support our growth and rapid expansion we needed to enhance our infrastructure and support systems. We completed the first phase of our enterprise-wide system upgrade initiative, Project Concrete, in June 2019. In an effort to ensure our infrastructure and support systems are sufficiently robust and scalable to deliver upon our current and anticipated future growth opportunities, we made key investments in our core financial and operational systems, which included those supporting our finance, procure-to-pay, inventory and human capital management areas.\nOur success in these growth strategies resonated through our fiscal 2019 results. Some financial highlights for fiscal 2019 include:\n \u2022 Total revenue increased 29.4% to $594.5 million. \n \u2022 Shack sales increased 29.0% to $574.6 million. \n \u2022 Same-Shack sales increased 1.3%. \n \u2022 Licensed revenue increased 45.0% to $19.9 million. \n \u2022 Shack system-wide sales increased 33.2% to $895.3 million. \n \u2022 Operating income was $25.7 million, or 4.3% of total revenue, which included the impact of costs associated with Project Concrete and other one-time items totaling $2.4 million. \n \u2022 Shack-level operating profit*, a non-GAAP measure, increased 13.4% to $128.0 million, or 22.3% of Shack sales. \n \u2022 Net income was $24.1 million and net income attributable to Shake Shack Inc. was $19.8 million, or $0.61 per diluted share. \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA*, a non-GAAP measure, increased 10.8% to $81.8 million. \n \u2022 Adjusted pro forma net income*, a non-GAAP measure, increased 1.7% to $27.4 million, or $0.72 per fully exchanged and diluted share. \n \u2022 73 system-wide Shack openings, including 39 domestic company-operated Shacks and 34 licensed Shacks. Six licensed Shack closures, which included four closures in Russia. System-wide Shack count net increase of 32.2%. \n* Shack-level operating profit, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted pro forma net income are non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of Shack-level operating profit to operating income, adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) attributable to Shake Shack Inc., and adjusted pro forma net income to net income (loss) attributable to Shake Shack Inc., the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, are set forth on pages 66-70.\nTRENDS IN OUR BUSINESS\n \nIn fiscal 2019 we continued to focus on driving long-term value creation and carried out our Stand For Something Good Mission by: putting our people first, creating a winning guest experience, engaging the community and operating with purpose.\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 55\nWe plan to continue to expand our business, drive Shack sales and enhance our competitive positioning by executing on the following strategies: (i) opening new domestic company-operated Shacks; (ii) growing our licensed Shack business, both domestically and abroad; (iii) expanding and enhancing our guest experience; and (iv) capitalizing on our outsized brand awareness.\nOur primary means of growth continues to be opening new domestic company-operated Shacks, increasing our footprint in our existing markets as well as expanding into a select number of new ones. We continue to broaden our Shack formats to suit our new and existing markets, such formats include free-standing pads, airports, events, food trucks, digital focused, urban, stadium, shopping center, mall, food court and roadside. Our development strategy in fiscal 2020 focuses on further penetration of existing markets, complemented by launches in some new markets, including Indianapolis and Sacramento.\nAs we continue to grow, especially outside of New York City and other urban markets, we expect our company-wide average unit volume (\"AUV\") for all domestic company-operated Shacks to continue to decline over time as Shacks of various unit volumes are introduced into the system. Our historical AUVs have been higher, due in large part to our concentration in New York City and urban markets, and as such, historical domestic company-operated AUVs are not a good measure of expected sales at new Shacks. For fiscal 2020, we expect domestic company-operated AUV to be between $3.7 to $3.8 million.\nWe continue to devote attention to expanding our licensed business, both internationally and domestically, which we executed this year with 24 international licensed Shack and 10 domestic licensed Shack openings. We opened Shacks in four additional countries throughout the year, including: three Shacks in mainland China, two Shacks in the Philippines, two Shacks in Mexico and one Shack in Singapore. A meaningful part of our international business strategy remains focused in Asia. To further foster our growth in Asia, we opened our first international office in Hong Kong in 2019 to support the brand and day-to-day operations. Domestically, we have continued to grow our licensed business, especially in our presence at airport locations around the country, which have been an exciting layer of growth to our licensed strategy. Of the 10 domestic licensed locations we opened in 2019, eight were in airports across the country. For further details around financial information about geographic areas, see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8.\nWe remain focused on expanding and enhancing our guest experience, which we strive to do so through the community gathering places we create, menu innovation and the digital space. We plan to execute on this strategy by:\n \u2022 Continuing to expand our Shacks through a variety of formats and gaining market share. Though our base is heavily weighted toward free-standing pads, and we plan on building many more of those, we are also looking to expand our footprint with our other formats, including: airports, events, food trucks, digital focused, urban, stadium, shopping center, mall, food court and roadside. \n \u2022 Creating buzz-worthy LTOs, innovating our core menu and looking towards new menu categories in fiscal 2020, which includes bringing back some guest favorites like the ShackMeister Burger and Hot Chick'n, as well as adding Hot Chick'n Bites. We will continue to use our Innovation Kitchen in New York and regionally around the country and globe to collaborate with chefs and test new items. \n \u2022 We will continue to evolve our digital strategy by providing the best app, kiosk and delivery experiences. As part of our digital expansion, we are working to redesign the full web experience, which encompasses everything from ordering on the app or your desktop, at the Shack or via Grubhub. \nThe first phase of our enterprise-wide systems upgrade initiative, Project Concrete, was completed in June 2019 and we plan on continuing the next phase in fiscal 2020. Given our expected growth of between 40 to 42 Shacks to open in fiscal 2020, and digital expansion over the past year, we recognize that it is essential for our infrastructure and support systems to be sufficiently robust and scalable to deliver upon our anticipated future growth opportunities. We will be focusing on our operational and back-office systems during this phase of the initiative and continuing in making those key investments necessary to reduce the administrative tasks in the Shacks.\nWhile we believe there are significant opportunities ahead of us, we also face many challenges, along with our industry, particularly around labor and related expenses, our digital expansion and geopolitical factors.\n \u2022 We expect the high labor cost trends to continue into fiscal 2020, as we have seen for the last couple of years. We believe that rising minimum wage legislation and a competitive and low unemployment labor market will continue to affect the restaurant industry and with significant mandatory increases in both minimum wages and salaries in many of our key markets. Additionally, we have seen increased regulatory pressures, such as the Fair Workweek legislation in New York City, with similar legislation proposed in other jurisdictions as well, including Philadelphia and Chicago in fiscal 2020. Several states in which we operate have enacted minimum wage increases and it is possible that other states or the federal government could also enact minimum \nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 56\nwage increases. Our primary challenge for fiscal 2020 and the next few years will be preserving our margins in the face of these rising labor costs. As more minimum wage increases are enacted, we may be required to implement additional pay increases or offer additional benefits in the future in order to attract and retain the most qualified people, which we expect to put further pressure on our operating margins. In addition to recruiting the most qualified people, we are committed to retaining our employees and will continue to evolve training, compensation and benefits to do so, for example, by extending our equity-based compensation program to general managers.\n \u2022 As we have described throughout our growth strategies, the digital space is a key area of focus for us and we are continuing to evolve in it. Digital touches upon almost every aspect of our guest experience, so it is crucial for us to understand our guest behaviors and remain competitive in the industry. For example, our delivery partnership with Grubhub was launched in 2019 and will take some time for us to evaluate and apply the insights we will learn through the guest data we retrieve. \n \u2022 In fiscal 2019 we further expanded internationally by opening our first Shacks in mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, the Philippines and Mexico. As with any international Shack, there remains risk due to political and economicl uncertainties. Specifically, due to the geopolitical factors in Hong Kong, we expect to see some impact due to closures from time to time. Additionally, with the onset of the coronavirus outbreak in China and the World Health Organization's declaration of its global health emergency, we would also expect to see lower traffic in the impacted areas and potentially beyond.  We expect our operating profit to increase in absolute terms and our margin to begin to stabilize in 2020 compared to the contraction seen over the past few years.\nWith 275 Shacks system-wide as of December 25, 2019, we remain excited for the new opportunities ahead of us, both domestically and abroad. Despite the challenges we face, we believe that we are positioned well for future growth.\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 57\nFISCAL 2020 GUIDANCE\n \nThese forward-looking projections are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the guidance set forth below. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year under the heading Risk Factors.\u201d These forward-looking projections should be reviewed in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the section titled Trends in Our Business\u201d which forms the basis of our assumptions used to prepare these forward-looking projections. You should not attribute undue certainty to these projections and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking information, except as required by law.\nFor the fiscal year ending December 30, 2020, a 53-week fiscal year, we are providing the following preliminary financial outlook:\n\n (1) Includes approximately $15 million sales impact from the 53rd week in 2020. \n (2) Includes approximately 1.5% to 2.0% of menu price increases taken in December 2019. \n (3) Normalized for the 53rd week. \n (4) Shack-level operating profit margin is a non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, operating income, has not been provided as we cannot project certain reconciling items, such as gains or losses on disposal of property and equipment, without unreasonable effort given the uncertainty around the timing and amount of such gains or losses. Losses on disposal of property and equipment were less than $1.5 million for each of the fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017. \n (5) Adjusted pro forma effective tax rate is a non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, income tax expense, has not been provided as we cannot project income tax expense without unreasonable effort due to our inability to predict changes in our ownership interest in SSE Holdings, LLC resulting from redemptions of LLC Interests by non-controlling interest holders and equity-based award activity. Income tax expense for fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $3.4 million, $8.9 million and $151.4 million, respectively. \nShake Shack Inc.

Form 10-K | 59\nShack Sales\nShack sales represent the aggregate sales of food, beverages and Shake Shack branded merchandise at our domestic company-operated Shacks. Shack sales in any period are directly influenced by the number of operating weeks in such period, the number of open Shacks and same-Shack sales. Same-Shack sales means, for any reporting period, sales for the comparable Shack base, which we define as the number of domestic company-operated Shacks open for 24 full fiscal months or longer.\n\nThe increase in Shack sales for fiscal 2019 is primarily driven by the opening of 39 new domestic company-operated Shacks and a same-Shack sales increase of 1.3%, which was approximately $4.3 million of the total increase in Shack sales. The same-Shack sales increase was primarily driven by a combined increase of 1.8% in price and sales mix partially offset by decreased guest traffic of 0.5%. For purposes of calculating same-Shack sales growth, Shack sales for 85 Shacks were included in the comparable Shack base. AUVs for domestic company-operated Shacks decreased to $4.1 million in fiscal 2019 from $4.4 million in fiscal 2018, primarily due to the addition of Shacks with lower unit volumes to the system.\nThe increase in Shack sales for fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by the opening of 34 new domestic company-operated Shacks and a same-Shack sales increase of 1.0%, which was approximately $2.5 million of the total increase in Shack sales. The same-Shack sales increase was primarily driven by a combined increase of 3.7% in price and sales mix partially offset by decreased guest traffic of 2.7%. For purposes of calculating same-Shack sales growth, Shack sales for 61 Shacks were included in the comparable Shack base. AUVs for domestic company-operated Shacks decreased to $4.4 million in fiscal 2018 from $4.6 million in fiscal 2017, primarily due to the addition of Shacks with lower unit volumes to the system.\nLicensing Revenue\nOn December 28, 2017, we adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Results for reporting periods beginning on or after December 28, 2017 are presented under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 (\"ASC 606\"). Prior period amounts were not revised and continue to be reported in accordance with ASC Topic 605 (\"ASC 605\"), the accounting standard then in effect. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for more information.\nLicensing revenue is comprised of sales-based royalty fees and amortization of certain upfront fees, including opening fees for certain licensed Shacks and initial territory fees received for the exclusive right to develop Shacks in a specific geographic area. Prior to the adoption of ASC 606, opening fees were typically recognized as revenue when a licensed Shack opened and territory fees were recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the license agreement.\n\nThe increase in licensing revenue for fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by the opening of 28 net licensed Shacks during the fiscal year and the strong performance of Shacks that opened in the new markets of Shanghai, Mexico City, Singapore and Manila.\nThis increase in licensing revenue for 2018 was primarily driven by the opening of 15 licensed Shacks during the fiscal year and strong performance in Asia, including the initial strength of newer Shacks in Hong Kong and Japan.\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 60\nFood and Paper Costs\nFood and paper costs include the direct costs associated with food, beverage and packaging of our menu items. The components of food and paper costs are variable by nature, change with sales volume, are impacted by menu mix and are subject to increases or decreases in commodity costs.\n\nThe increase in food and paper costs for fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the opening of 39 new domestic company-operated Shacks during the fiscal year. The increase in food and paper costs as a percentage of Shack sales for fiscal 2019 was driven by a higher cost profile of Chick'n Bites, which launched in January 2019; significant commodity inflation in beef and some inflation with dairy; and an increase in paper costs, as a direct result of digital sales mix, which comes with additional packaging.\nThe increase in food and paper costs for fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the opening of 34 new domestic company-operated Shacks during the fiscal year. The decrease in food and paper costs as a percentage of Shack sales for fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the menu price increase we implemented in December 2017, sponsorship receipts for our biennial leadership retreat and costs associated with the free burger promotion in fiscal 2017 related to the launch of our mobile app that did not exist in fiscal 2018.\nLabor and Related Expenses\nLabor and related expenses include domestic company-operated Shack-level hourly and management wages, bonuses, payroll taxes, equity-based compensation, workers' compensation expense and medical benefits. As we expect with other variable expense items, we expect labor costs to grow as our Shack sales grow. Factors that influence labor costs include minimum wage and payroll tax legislation, health care costs and the performance of our domestic company-operated Shacks.\n\nThe increase in labor and related expenses for fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the opening of 39 new domestic company-operated Shacks during the fiscal year. As a percentage of Shack sales, the increase in labor and related expenses for fiscal 2019 was driven by ongoing wage inflation attributable to the availability of labor across the country, as well as the impact of increased staffing levels at new Shacks resulting in higher payroll costs\nThe increase in labor and related expenses for fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the opening of 34 new domestic company-operated Shacks during the fiscal year. As a percentage of Shack sales, the increase in labor and related expenses for fiscal 2018 was due to the opening of 34 new domestic company-operated Shacks, as well as the timing of new Shack openings, which typically carry higher labor costs during the first few months of operations, and ongoing increases to hourly minimum wages and regulatory factors, such as the Fair Workweek legislation in New York City.\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 61\nOther Operating Expenses\nOther operating expenses consist of Shack-level repairs and maintenance, utilities, Shack-level marketing expenses and other operating expenses incidental to operating our domestic company-operated Shacks, such as non-perishable supplies, credit card fees, delivery commissions and business insurance.\n\nThe increase in other operating expenses for fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the opening of 39 new domestic company-operated Shacks during the fiscal year. As a percentage of Shack sales, the increase in other operating expenses for fiscal 2019 was primarily due to increased Shack-level marketing activity, delivery commissions and investment in in-Shack technology infrastructure.\nThe increase in other operating expenses for fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the opening of 34 new domestic company-operated Shacks during the fiscal year. As a percentage of Shack sales, the increase in other operating expenses for fiscal 2018 was primarily due to commissions paid as part of integrated delivery pilots and the impact of higher repairs and maintenance and certain fixed operating expenses spread across Shacks at a broader range of average unit volumes.\nOccupancy and Related Expenses\nOccupancy and related expenses consist of Shack-level occupancy expenses (including rent, common area expenses and certain local taxes), excluding pre-opening costs, which are recorded separately.\n\nThe increase in occupancy and related expenses for fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the opening of 39 new domestic company-operated Shacks during the fiscal year. As a percentage of Shack sales, the increase in occupancy and related expenses for fiscal 2019 was driven by the adoption of the new lease accounting standard,ASU 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842), that went into effect at the beginning of this fiscal year, as well as a benefit recognized in the prior year for deferred rent related to certain historical leases with co-tenancy provisions.\nThe increase in occupancy and related expenses for fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the opening of 34 new domestic company-operated Shacks during the fiscal year. As a percentage of Shack sales, the decrease in occupancy and related expenses for fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the increased number of leases where we are deemed to be the accounting owner and for which less rent expense is recognized and the impact from a one-time benefit to deferred rent related to certain historical leases with co-tenancy provisions, partially offset by the introduction of Shacks at various volumes into the system.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist of costs associated with Home Office and administrative functions that support Shack development and operations, as well as equity-based compensation expense.\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 62\n\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by an increase in our investment across the business to support our growth, and $2.4 million of one-time charges, primarily related to Project Concrete. As a percentage of total revenue, the decrease in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2019 was primarily due sales leverage, offset by the aforementioned items.\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by the increase in the Company's investment across the business, particularly in the addition of headcount to support its ongoing growth initiatives and $3.9 million of one-time charges, including a legal settlement of $1.2 million and costs related to Project Concrete. As a percentage of total revenue, the increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2018 was primarily due to higher Shack sales.\nDepreciation Expense\nDepreciation expense consists of the depreciation of fixed assets, including leasehold improvements and equipment.\n\nThe increase in depreciation expense for fiscal 2019 was primarily due to incremental depreciation associated with the capital expenditures related to the 39 new domestic company-operated Shacks that opened during the fiscal year. As a percentage of total revenue, the increase in depreciation expense for fiscal 2019 was primarily due to incremental depreciation of property, plant and equipment related to the opening of 39 new domestic company-operated Shacks during the fiscal year, as well as the introduction of Shacks at various volumes into the system.\nThe increase in depreciation expense for fiscal 2018 was primarily due to incremental depreciation associated with the capital expenditures related to the 34 new domestic company-operated Shacks that opened during the fiscal year. As a percentage of total revenue, the increase in depreciation expense for fiscal 2018 was primarily due to incremental depreciation of property, plant and equipment related to the opening of 34 new domestic company-operated Shacks during the fiscal year, as well as the introduction of Shacks at various volumes into the system.\nPre-Opening Costs\nPre-opening costs consist primarily of: (i) rent; (ii) managers' salaries; (iii) training costs; (iv) employee payroll and related expenses; (iv) all costs to relocate and compensate Shack management teams prior to an opening; (v) wages, travel and lodging costs for our opening training team and other support team members; (vi) marketing costs; (vii) attorney fees; and (viii) permits and licensing. All such costs incurred prior to the opening of a domestic company-operated Shack are expensed in the period in which the expense is incurred. Pre-opening costs can fluctuate significantly from period to period, based on the number and timing of domestic company-operated Shack openings and the specific pre-opening costs recognized for each domestic company-operated Shack. Additionally, domestic company-operated Shack openings in new geographic market areas will initially experience higher pre-opening costs than our established geographic market areas, such as the New York City metropolitan area, where we have greater economies of scale and typically incur lower travel and lodging costs for our training team.\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 63\n\nThe increase in pre-opening costs for fiscal 2019 and 2018 was primarily due to an increased number of openings and the timing of new domestic company-operated openings.\nLoss on Disposal of Property and Equipment\nLoss on disposal of property and equipment represents the net book value of assets that have been retired and consists primarily of furniture, equipment and fixtures that were replaced in the normal course of business or as a part of Shack renovations.\n\nThe loss on disposal of property and equipment in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 was primarily due to the number of maturing Shacks in our base.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net consists of interest income, dividend income, adjustments to liabilities under our tax receivable agreement and net realized gains and losses from the sale of marketable securities.\n\nThe increase in other income, net for fiscal 2019 primarily related to dividend income, other income related to the adjustment of liabilities under the tax receivable agreement and unrealized gains related to our investments in marketable securities.\nThe decrease in other income, net for fiscal 2018 primarily related to a $127.2 million one-time adjustment made in the prior year to reduce our liabilities under tax receivable agreement in connection with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"TCJA\"). No such adjustment was made in fiscal 2018.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense primarily consists of amortization of deferred financing costs, imputed interest on deferred compensation, interest on the current portion of our liabilities under the Tax Receivable Agreement, imputed interest on our deemed landlord financing liability as well as interest and fees on our Revolving Credit Facility.\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 64\n\nThe decreases in interest expense for fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the leases where we were deemed, for accounting purposes, to be the owner in the prior year, but are no longer considered to be after the adoption of the new lease accounting standard.\nThe decreases in interest expense for fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the increased number of additional lease financing arrangements where we were deemed, for accounting purposes, to be the owner.\nIncome Tax Expense\nAs a result of the IPO and the Organizational Transactions, we became the sole managing member of SSE Holdings, which is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal and most applicable state and local income tax purposes. As a partnership, SSE Holdings is not subject to U.S. federal and certain state and local income taxes. Any taxable income or loss generated by SSE Holdings is passed through to and included in the taxable income or loss of its members, including us, on a pro rata basis. We are subject to U.S. federal income taxes, in addition to state and local income taxes with respect to our allocable share of any taxable income or loss generated by SSE Holdings.\n\nThe decrease in income tax expense for fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by higher tax credits, an increase of windfall tax benefits from equity-based compensation and a decrease in valuation allowance, partially offset by an increase in our ownership interest in SSE Holdings. As our ownership interest in SSE Holdings increases, our share of the taxable income of SSE Holdings also increases. Our weighted-average ownership interest in SSE Holdings increased to 84.1% in fiscal 2019 from 76.6% in 2018. Our effective income tax rate decreased to 12.3% in fiscal 2019 from 28.8% in fiscal 2018 primarily due to the aforementioned items.\nThe decrease in income tax expense for fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by the remeasurement of the deferred tax assets in fiscal 2017 made in connection with the enactment of the TCJA, which resulted in $138.6 million of additional income tax expense, which was partially offset by an increase in our ownership interest in SSE Holdings. As our ownership interest in SSE Holdings increases, our share of the taxable income of SSE Holdings also increases. Our weighted-average ownership interest in SSE Holdings increased to 76.6% in fiscal 2018 from 70.6% in fiscal 2017. Our effective income tax rate decreased to 28.8% in fiscal 2018 from 94.5% in fiscal 2017 primarily due to the aforementioned remeasurement of deferred tax assets in connection with the enactment of the TCJA in the prior year.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests\nWe are the sole managing member of SSE Holdings and have the sole voting power in, and control the management of, SSE Holdings. Accordingly, we consolidate the financial results of SSE Holdings and report a non-controlling interest on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss), representing the portion of net income attributable to the other members of SSE Holdings. The SSE Holdings LLC Agreement provides that holders of LLC Interests may, from time to time, require SSE Holdings to redeem all or a portion of their LLC Interests for newly-issued shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. In connection with any redemption or exchange, we receive a corresponding number of LLC Interests, increasing our total ownership interest in SSE Holdings. The weighted average ownership percentages for the applicable reporting periods are used to attribute net income and other comprehensive income to Shake Shack Inc. and the non-controlling interest holders.\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 65\n\nThe decrease in net income attributable to non-controlling interests for fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by an increase in our weighted-average ownership interest in SSE Holdings from 76.6% in fiscal 2018 to 84.1% in fiscal 2019 as a result of redemptions of LLC Interests and the GTC Merger.\nThe decrease in net income attributable to non-controlling interests for fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by an increase in our weighted-average ownership interest in SSE Holdings from 70.6% in fiscal 2017 to 76.6% in fiscal 2018 as a result of redemptions of LLC Interests.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n \nTo supplement the consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: Shack-level operating profit, Shack-level operating profit margin, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted pro forma net income and adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share (collectively the \"non-GAAP financial measures\").\nShack-Level Operating Profit\nWe define Shack-level operating profit as Shack sales less Shack-level operating expenses including food and paper costs, labor and related expenses, other operating expenses and occupancy and related expenses.\nHow This Measure Is Useful\nWhen used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, Shack-level operating profit and Shack-level operating profit margin are supplemental measures of operating performance that we believe are useful measures to evaluate the performance and profitability of our Shacks. Additionally, Shack-level operating profit and Shack-level operating profit margin are key metrics used internally by our management to develop internal budgets and forecasts, as well as assess the performance of our Shacks relative to budget and against prior periods. It is also used to evaluate employee compensation as it serves as a metric in certain of our performance-based employee bonus arrangements. We believe presentation of Shack-level operating profit and Shack-level operating profit margin provides investors with a supplemental view of our operating performance that can provide meaningful insights to the underlying operating performance of our Shacks, as these measures depict the operating results that are directly impacted by our Shacks and exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, the ongoing operations of our Shacks. It may also assist investors to evaluate our performance relative to peers of various sizes and maturities and provides greater transparency with respect to how our management evaluates our business, as well as our financial and operational decision-making.\nLimitations of the Usefulness of this Measure\nShack-level operating profit and Shack-level operating profit margin may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation. Presentation of Shack-level operating profit and Shack-level operating profit margin is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Shack-level operating profit excludes certain costs, such as general and administrative expenses and pre-opening costs, which are considered normal, recurring cash operating expenses and are essential to support the operation and development of our Shacks. Therefore, this measure may not provide a complete understanding of the operating results of our company as a whole and Shack-level operating profit and Shack-level operating profit margin should be reviewed in conjunction with our GAAP financial results. A reconciliation of Shack-level operating profit to operating income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows.\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 66\n\n (1) As a percentage of Shack sales. \nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense (net of interest income), income tax expense and depreciation and amortization expense. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA (as defined above) excluding equity-based compensation expense, deferred lease cost, losses on the disposal of property and equipment, amortization of cloud-based software implementation costs, as well as certain non-recurring items that we do not believe directly reflect our core operations and may not be indicative of our recurring business operations.\nHow These Measures Are Useful\nWhen used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental measures of operating performance that we believe are useful measures to facilitate comparisons to historical performance and competitors' operating results. Adjusted EBITDA is a key metric used internally by our management to develop internal budgets and forecasts and also serves as a metric in our performance-based equity incentive programs and certain of our bonus arrangements. We believe presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with a supplemental view of our operating performance that facilitates analysis and comparisons of our ongoing business operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of our ongoing operating performance.\nLimitations of the Usefulness of These Measures\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation. Presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exclude certain normal recurring expenses. Therefore, these measures may not provide a complete understanding of our performance and should be reviewed in conjunction with our GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is as follows.\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 67\n\n (1) Represents amortization of capitalized implementation costs related to cloud-based software arrangements that are included within general and administrative expenses. \n (2) Reflects the extent to which lease expense is greater than or less than cash lease payments. As a result of adoption of the new lease accounting standard on December 27, 2018, these lease costs may also include certain additional lease components, such as common area maintenance costs and property taxes, that were previously not included in lease expense for prior periods. \n (3) Represents fees paid in connection with the search for certain of our executive and key management positions, non-recurring signing bonuses and other transition costs, including related equity-based compensation. \n (4) Represents consulting and advisory fees related to our enterprise-wide system upgrade initiative called Project Concrete. \n (5) Costs incurred in connection with our relocation to a new Home Office. \n (6) Represents costs associated with establishing our first international regional office in Hong Kong. \n (7) Expense incurred to establish an accrual related to the settlement of a legal matter. \n (8) Calculated as a percentage of total revenue, which was $594,519, $459,310, $358,810, $268,475, and $190,592 for the fiscal years ended December 25, 2019, December 26, 2018, December 27, 2017, December 28, 2016 and December 30, 2015, respectively.  Adjusted Pro Forma Net Income and Adjusted Pro Forma Earnings Per Fully Exchanged and Diluted Share\nAdjusted pro forma net income represents net income (loss) attributable to Shake Shack Inc. assuming the full exchange of all outstanding SSE Holdings, LLC membership interests (\"LLC Interests\") for shares of Class A common stock, adjusted for certain non-recurring items that we do not believe directly reflect our core operations and may not be indicative of our recurring business operations. Adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share is calculated by dividing adjusted pro forma net income by the weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding, assuming the full exchange of all outstanding LLC Interests, after giving effect to the dilutive effect of outstanding equity-based awards.\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 68\nHow These Measures Are Useful\nWhen used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, adjusted pro forma net income and adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share are supplemental measures of operating performance that", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

Our fine dining heritage and commitment to community building, hospitality and the sourcing of premium ingredients is what we call \"fine casual.\" Fine casual couples the ease, value and convenience of fast casual concepts with the high standards of excellence grounded in our fine dining heritage-thoughtful ingredient sourcing and preparation, hospitality and quality.\nOur mission is to Stand For Something Good in all aspects of our business, including the exceptional team we hire and train, the premium ingredients making up our menu, our community engagement and the design of our Shacks. Stand For Something Good is a call to action for all of our stakeholders-our team, guests, communities, suppliers and investors-and we actively invite them all to share in this philosophy with us. This commitment drives our integration into the local communities in which we operate and fosters a deep and lasting connection with our guests.\nFISCAL 2019 HIGHLIGHTS\n \nFiscal 2019 was another strong year for Shake Shack in which we continued to execute upon our growth strategy by opening a record-breaking number of domestic company-operated Shacks, further expanded our licensed business both internationally and domestic, enhanced our infrastructure and support systems and kept focus on our digital strategy, specifically in rolling out our delivery partnership. We met our targeted growth plan and opened 39 domestic company-operated Shacks and we entered into the new markets of New Orleans, Salt Lake City and Columbus, as well as deepened our roots in our current markets across the country. Internationally, we expanded our footprint by opening 24 new licensed Shacks, which included our first Shack openings in Shanghai, Mexico City, Singapore and Manila. Additionally, we opened 10 domestic licensed Shacks, further supporting our licensed growth strategy with eight of those openings in airports across the country.\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 54\nWe further executed upon our commitment of putting our people first. To foster an inclusive and diverse work environment, we launched our All-In initiative across the entire organization. The All-In program works to provide equal opportunities for success, removing obstacles and fostering a culture of diversity, inclusion and empowerment. This program included a number of new initiatives, including a mentorship program, flexible work arrangement policy and the pilot of our 4-day workweek for Shack managers. We were proud to be named one of the \"Best places to work for LGBTQ+ Equality\" and earn a 100% score on the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index for our support of the LGBTQ+ community in the workplace.\nWe continued to innovate our menu throughout fiscal 2019 with exciting promotions and events, chef collaborations, LTOs and limited launches from our Innovation Kitchen. One of the biggest promotions we ran was in honor of the final season of Game of Throne where we launched our limited-edition #ForTheThrone menu. This promotion included our icy Dragonglass Shake and our Dracarys Burger, as well as offering limited edition shake cups at Shacks nationwide. We also featured a different shake each month throughout the year as well as a variety of lemonades. Additionally, we launched Chick'n Bites as an LTO and have since added to the core menu.\nFor the past couple of years we have participated in various delivery pilots with a number of partners. In 2019 we announced our national integrated partnership with Grubhub. We believe our partnership allows us to provide faster delivery, fresher food and a winning guest experience. We will also have access to enhanced tools to analyze performance and ordering trends to be able to connect with guests in new and more personalized ways, as well as engage in joint marketing initiatives that we believe will generate connections with new guests and drive order frequency for existing fans. We also ran our #SHACKUP campaign throughout the year in celebration of our new delivery partnership. This campaign featured an elevated Shake Shack experience highlighting key delivery moments, such as treat yourself, family dinner, date night, celebrating with friends and ordering for the office team.\nTo support our growth and rapid expansion we needed to enhance our infrastructure and support systems. We completed the first phase of our enterprise-wide system upgrade initiative, Project Concrete, in June 2019. In an effort to ensure our infrastructure and support systems are sufficiently robust and scalable to deliver upon our current and anticipated future growth opportunities, we made key investments in our core financial and operational systems, which included those supporting our finance, procure-to-pay, inventory and human capital management areas.\nOur success in these growth strategies resonated through our fiscal 2019 results. Some financial highlights for fiscal 2019 include:\n \u2022 Total revenue increased 29.4% to $594.5 million. \n \u2022 Shack sales increased 29.0% to $574.6 million. \n \u2022 Same-Shack sales increased 1.3%. \n \u2022 Licensed revenue increased 45.0% to $19.9 million. \n \u2022 Shack system-wide sales increased 33.2% to $895.3 million. \n \u2022 Operating income was $25.7 million, or 4.3% of total revenue, which included the impact of costs associated with Project Concrete and other one-time items totaling $2.4 million. \n \u2022 Shack-level operating profit*, a non-GAAP measure, increased 13.4% to $128.0 million, or 22.3% of Shack sales. \n \u2022 Net income was $24.1 million and net income attributable to Shake Shack Inc. was $19.8 million, or $0.61 per diluted share. \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA*, a non-GAAP measure, increased 10.8% to $81.8 million. \n \u2022 Adjusted pro forma net income*, a non-GAAP measure, increased 1.7% to $27.4 million, or $0.72 per fully exchanged and diluted share. \n \u2022 73 system-wide Shack openings, including 39 domestic company-operated Shacks and 34 licensed Shacks. Six licensed Shack closures, which included four closures in Russia. System-wide Shack count net increase of 32.2%. \n* Shack-level operating profit, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted pro forma net income are non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of Shack-level operating profit to operating income, adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) attributable to Shake Shack Inc., and adjusted pro forma net income to net income (loss) attributable to Shake Shack Inc., the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, are set forth on pages 66-70.\nTRENDS IN OUR BUSINESS\n \nIn fiscal 2019 we continued to focus on driving long-term value creation and carried out our Stand For Something Good Mission by: putting our people first, creating a winning guest experience, engaging the community and operating with purpose.\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 55\nWe plan to continue to expand our business, drive Shack sales and enhance our competitive positioning by executing on the following strategies: (i) opening new domestic company-operated Shacks; (ii) growing our licensed Shack business, both domestically and abroad; (iii) expanding and enhancing our guest experience; and (iv) capitalizing on our outsized brand awareness.\nOur primary means of growth continues to be opening new domestic company-operated Shacks, increasing our footprint in our existing markets as well as expanding into a select number of new ones. We continue to broaden our Shack formats to suit our new and existing markets, such formats include free-standing pads, airports, events, food trucks, digital focused, urban, stadium, shopping center, mall, food court and roadside. Our development strategy in fiscal 2020 focuses on further penetration of existing markets, complemented by launches in some new markets, including Indianapolis and Sacramento.\nAs we continue to grow, especially outside of New York City and other urban markets, we expect our company-wide average unit volume (\"AUV\") for all domestic company-operated Shacks to continue to decline over time as Shacks of various unit volumes are introduced into the system. Our historical AUVs have been higher, due in large part to our concentration in New York City and urban markets, and as such, historical domestic company-operated AUVs are not a good measure of expected sales at new Shacks. For fiscal 2020, we expect domestic company-operated AUV to be between $3.7 to $3.8 million.\nWe continue to devote attention to expanding our licensed business, both internationally and domestically, which we executed this year with 24 international licensed Shack and 10 domestic licensed Shack openings. We opened Shacks in four additional countries throughout the year, including: three Shacks in mainland China, two Shacks in the Philippines, two Shacks in Mexico and one Shack in Singapore. A meaningful part of our international business strategy remains focused in Asia. To further foster our growth in Asia, we opened our first international office in Hong Kong in 2019 to support the brand and day-to-day operations. Domestically, we have continued to grow our licensed business, especially in our presence at airport locations around the country, which have been an exciting layer of growth to our licensed strategy. Of the 10 domestic licensed locations we opened in 2019, eight were in airports across the country. For further details around financial information about geographic areas, see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8.\nWe remain focused on expanding and enhancing our guest experience, which we strive to do so through the community gathering places we create, menu innovation and the digital space. We plan to execute on this strategy by:\n \u2022 Continuing to expand our Shacks through a variety of formats and gaining market share. Though our base is heavily weighted toward free-standing pads, and we plan on building many more of those, we are also looking to expand our footprint with our other formats, including: airports, events, food trucks, digital focused, urban, stadium, shopping center, mall, food court and roadside. \n \u2022 Creating buzz-worthy LTOs, innovating our core menu and looking towards new menu categories in fiscal 2020, which includes bringing back some guest favorites like the ShackMeister Burger and Hot Chick'n, as well as adding Hot Chick'n Bites. We will continue to use our Innovation Kitchen in New York and regionally around the country and globe to collaborate with chefs and test new items. \n \u2022 We will continue to evolve our digital strategy by providing the best app, kiosk and delivery experiences. As part of our digital expansion, we are working to redesign the full web experience, which encompasses everything from ordering on the app or your desktop, at the Shack or via Grubhub. \nThe first phase of our enterprise-wide systems upgrade initiative, Project Concrete, was completed in June 2019 and we plan on continuing the next phase in fiscal 2020. Given our expected growth of between 40 to 42 Shacks to open in fiscal 2020, and digital expansion over the past year, we recognize that it is essential for our infrastructure and support systems to be sufficiently robust and scalable to deliver upon our anticipated future growth opportunities. We will be focusing on our operational and back-office systems during this phase of the initiative and continuing in making those key investments necessary to reduce the administrative tasks in the Shacks.\nWhile we believe there are significant opportunities ahead of us, we also face many challenges, along with our industry, particularly around labor and related expenses, our digital expansion and geopolitical factors.\n \u2022 We expect the high labor cost trends to continue into fiscal 2020, as we have seen for the last couple of years. We believe that rising minimum wage legislation and a competitive and low unemployment labor market will continue to affect the restaurant industry and with significant mandatory increases in both minimum wages and salaries in many of our key markets. Additionally, we have seen increased regulatory pressures, such as the Fair Workweek legislation in New York City, with similar legislation proposed in other jurisdictions as well, including Philadelphia and Chicago in fiscal 2020. Several states in which we operate have enacted minimum wage increases and it is possible that other states or the federal government could also enact minimum \nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 56\nwage increases. Our primary challenge for fiscal 2020 and the next few years will be preserving our margins in the face of these rising labor costs. As more minimum wage increases are enacted, we may be required to implement additional pay increases or offer additional benefits in the future in order to attract and retain the most qualified people, which we expect to put further pressure on our operating margins. In addition to recruiting the most qualified people, we are committed to retaining our employees and will continue to evolve training, compensation and benefits to do so, for example, by extending our equity-based compensation program to general managers.\n \u2022 As we have described throughout our growth strategies, the digital space is a key area of focus for us and we are continuing to evolve in it. Digital touches upon almost every aspect of our guest experience, so it is crucial for us to understand our guest behaviors and remain competitive in the industry. For example, our delivery partnership with Grubhub was launched in 2019 and will take some time for us to evaluate and apply the insights we will learn through the guest data we retrieve. \n \u2022 In fiscal 2019 we further expanded internationally by opening our first Shacks in mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, the Philippines and Mexico. As with any international Shack, there remains risk due to political and economicl uncertainties. Specifically, due to the geopolitical factors in Hong Kong, we expect to see some impact due to closures from time to time. Additionally, with the onset of the coronavirus outbreak in China and the World Health Organization's declaration of its global health emergency, we would also expect to see lower traffic in the impacted areas and potentially beyond.  We expect our operating profit to increase in absolute terms and our margin to begin to stabilize in 2020 compared to the contraction seen over the past few years.\nWith 275 Shacks system-wide as of December 25, 2019, we remain excited for the new opportunities ahead of us, both domestically and abroad. Despite the challenges we face, we believe that we are positioned well for future growth.\nShake Shack Inc.

The same-Shack sales increase was primarily driven by a combined increase of 1.8% in price and sales mix partially offset by decreased guest traffic of 0.5%. For purposes of calculating same-Shack sales growth, Shack sales for 85 Shacks were included in the comparable Shack base. AUVs for domestic company-operated Shacks decreased to $4.1 million in fiscal 2019 from $4.4 million in fiscal 2018, primarily due to the addition of Shacks with lower unit volumes to the system.\nThe increase in Shack sales for fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by the opening of 34 new domestic company-operated Shacks and a same-Shack sales increase of 1.0%, which was approximately $2.5 million of the total increase in Shack sales.

AUVs for domestic company-operated Shacks decreased to $4.4 million in fiscal 2018 from $4.6 million in fiscal 2017, primarily due to the addition of Shacks with lower unit volumes to the system.\nLicensing Revenue\nOn December 28, 2017, we adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).

Prior period amounts were not revised and continue to be reported in accordance with ASC Topic 605 (\"ASC 605\"), the accounting standard then in effect. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for more information.\nLicensing revenue is comprised of sales-based royalty fees and amortization of certain upfront fees, including opening fees for certain licensed Shacks and initial territory fees received for the exclusive right to develop Shacks in a specific geographic area. Prior to the adoption of ASC 606, opening fees were typically recognized as revenue when a licensed Shack opened and territory fees were recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the license agreement.\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollar amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Licensing revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Dollar change compared to prior year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Percentage change compared to prior year\n</td> <td>45.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in licensing revenue for fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by the opening of 28 net licensed Shacks during the fiscal year and the strong performance of Shacks that opened in the new markets of Shanghai, Mexico City, Singapore and Manila.\nThis increase in licensing revenue for 2018 was primarily driven by the opening of 15 licensed Shacks during the fiscal year and strong performance in Asia, including the initial strength of newer Shacks in Hong Kong and Japan.\nShake Shack Inc.

The increase in food and paper costs as a percentage of Shack sales for fiscal 2019 was driven by a higher cost profile of Chick'n Bites, which launched in January 2019; significant commodity inflation in beef and some inflation with dairy; and an increase in paper costs, as a direct result of digital sales mix, which comes with additional packaging.\nThe increase in food and paper costs for fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the opening of 34 new domestic company-operated Shacks during the fiscal year. The decrease in food and paper costs as a percentage of Shack sales for fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the menu price increase we implemented in December 2017, sponsorship receipts for our biennial leadership retreat and costs associated with the free burger promotion in fiscal 2017 related to the launch of our mobile app that did not exist in fiscal 2018.\nLabor and Related Expenses\nLabor and related expenses include domestic company-operated Shack-level hourly and management wages, bonuses, payroll taxes, equity-based compensation, workers' compensation expense and medical benefits. As we expect with other variable expense items, we expect labor costs to grow as our Shack sales grow. Factors that influence labor costs include minimum wage and payroll tax legislation, health care costs and the performance of our domestic company-operated Shacks.\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollar amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Labor and related expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>160,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>122,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91,740\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of Shack sales\n</td> <td>28.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Dollar change compared to prior year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Percentage change compared to prior year\n</td> <td>31.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in labor and related expenses for fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the opening of 39 new domestic company-operated Shacks during the fiscal year.

All such costs incurred prior to the opening of a domestic company-operated Shack are expensed in the period in which the expense is incurred. Pre-opening costs can fluctuate significantly from period to period, based on the number and timing of domestic company-operated Shack openings and the specific pre-opening costs recognized for each domestic company-operated Shack. Additionally, domestic company-operated Shack openings in new geographic market areas will initially experience higher pre-opening costs than our established geographic market areas, such as the New York City metropolitan area, where we have greater economies of scale and typically incur lower travel and lodging costs for our training team.\nShake Shack Inc.

Additionally, Shack-level operating profit and Shack-level operating profit margin are key metrics used internally by our management to develop internal budgets and forecasts, as well as assess the performance of our Shacks relative to budget and against prior periods. It is also used to evaluate employee compensation as it serves as a metric in certain of our performance-based employee bonus arrangements. We believe presentation of Shack-level operating profit and Shack-level operating profit margin provides investors with a supplemental view of our operating performance that can provide meaningful insights to the underlying operating performance of our Shacks, as these measures depict the operating results that are directly impacted by our Shacks and exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, the ongoing operations of our Shacks. It may also assist investors to evaluate our performance relative to peers of various sizes and maturities and provides greater transparency with respect to how our management evaluates our business, as well as our financial and operational decision-making.\nLimitations of the Usefulness of this Measure\nShack-level operating profit and Shack-level operating profit margin may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation. Presentation of Shack-level operating profit and Shack-level operating profit margin is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Shack-level operating profit excludes certain costs, such as general and administrative expenses and pre-opening costs, which are considered normal, recurring cash operating expenses and are essential to support the operation and development of our Shacks. Therefore, this measure may not provide a complete understanding of the operating results of our company as a whole and Shack-level operating profit and Shack-level operating profit margin should be reviewed in conjunction with our GAAP financial results. A reconciliation of Shack-level operating profit to operating income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows.\nShake Shack Inc.

Adjusted EBITDA is a key metric used internally by our management to develop internal budgets and forecasts and also serves as a metric in our performance-based equity incentive programs and certain of our bonus arrangements. We believe presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with a supplemental view of our operating performance that facilitates analysis and comparisons of our ongoing business operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of our ongoing operating performance.\nLimitations of the Usefulness of These Measures\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation. Presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exclude certain normal recurring expenses. Therefore, these measures may not provide a complete understanding of our performance and should be reviewed in conjunction with our GAAP financial measures.
