MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nIn 2018, we experienced the persistent competitiveness of the airline industry and the impact of the volatility in the price of jet fuel. Even with these external factors, we managed to generate operating revenue growth of almost 9.2% year-over-year. We remain committed to striving to deliver a safe and reliable JetBlue Experience for our Customers and increasing returns for our Shareholders. We believe our continued focus on cost discipline, product innovation and network enhancements, combined with our commitment to service excellence, will drive our future success.\n2018 Highlights\n\u2022We generated $7.7 billion in operating revenue, an increase of $646 million compared to 2017 due primarily to a 5.3% increase in revenue passengers and a 3.7% increase in average fare.\n\u2022Our earnings per diluted share were $0.60. Our results included pre-tax charges of $435 million related to one-time costs associated with the ratification of our pilots' collective bargaining agreement and the transition of our Embraer E190 fleet. Our earnings per share also included a fourth quarter tax benefit of $17 million. Excluding these items, our diluted earnings per share would be $1.55.\n\u2022We generated $1.2 billion in cash from operations. The significant amount of cash we generated provided the opportunity to pay cash for all 2018 aircraft deliveries, buy out two aircraft leases, invest in our infrastructure and customer experience, and execute share repurchases.\n\u2022Operating expenses per available seat mile increased 14.5% to 12.31 cents, primarily driven by an increase in aircraft fuel expense and the pre-tax charges mentioned above. Excluding fuel and related taxes, operating expenses related to our non-airline businesses, and the pre-tax charges for special items, our cost per available seat mile increased 1.1% in 2018.\nCompany Initiatives\nBalance Sheet\nWe ended 2018 with unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $887 million and undrawn lines of credit of approximately $625 million. In June 2017, Moody's Investor Service upgraded our debt rating to Ba1 from Ba3 with a stable outlook reflecting the strength of our financial position. In November 2017, Standard & Poor's Rating Services upgraded our debt rating to BB from BB- with a stable outlook. At December 31, 2018, unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was approximately 12% of trailing twelve months revenue. In 2018, we repaid $222 million of regularly scheduled debt and raised $687 million in secured aircraft debt. We had 107 unencumbered aircraft and 44 unencumbered spare engines as of December 31, 2018. During 2018, we acquired approximately 19.1 million shares of our common stock for approximately $375 million under our share repurchase program, returning excess capital to our Shareholders. Our adjusted debt to capitalization ratio was 34% at December 31, 2018.\nAircraft and Airport Infrastructure Investments\nDuring 2018, we took delivery of 10 Airbus A321 aircraft and bought out the leases on two aircraft, one of which was an Airbus A321 aircraft and the other was an Airbus A320 aircraft.\nIn 2018, we opened a new Federal Inspection Station, FIS, in Terminal A at Luis Munoz Marin International Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The FIS enables our international and domestic flights to arrive at the same terminal and thus provides a better experience to our Customers by reducing connection times.\nWe introduced self-tagging kiosks to eleven BlueCities in 2018: Las Vegas, Reagan National at Washington D.C., Fort Myers, Tampa, Seattle, Hartford, Salt Lake City, Philadelphia, Richmond, Pittsburgh, and Baltimore. Self-tagging kiosks were available at 23 of our BlueCities as of December 31, 2018. These kiosks helped streamline the airport experience for our Customers and we plan to introduce the improvements to additional BlueCities in 2019.\nNetwork\nAs part of our ongoing network initiatives and route optimization efforts, we continued to make schedule and frequency adjustments throughout 2018. As a result, we added four new destinations to our growing network and also new routes between existing BlueCities.\nOutlook for 2019\nWe believe we will improve our long-term return for Shareholders as we implement our structural cost initiatives. We plan to add new destinations and route pairings based upon market demand. We are continuously looking to expand our other ancillary revenue opportunities, improve our TrueBlue\u00ae loyalty program, and deepen our portfolio of commercial partnerships. As in the past, we intend to invest in infrastructure and product enhancements in 2019, which we believe will enable us to reap future benefits. We also plan to continue strengthening the balance sheet.\nFor the full year 2019, we estimate our operating capacity will increase by approximately 5.0% to 7.0% over 2018 with the expected delivery of six Airbus A321neo aircraft to our operating fleet. We are expecting our cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and related taxes, and operating expenses related to other non-airline businesses (CASM ex-fuel), for 2019 to increase by between approximately 0.0% to 2.0% over the level in 2018. We anticipate CASM ex-fuel growth to be higher in the first half of 2019 primarily driven by the pilots' collective bargaining agreement which became effective on August 1, 2018. We expect to see further benefits to CASM ex-fuel from the Structural Cost Program and greater impact from the Airbus A320 cabin restyle program during the second half of 2019.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n2018 Compared to 2017\nOverview\nWe reported net income of $188 million, operating income of $288 million and operating margin of 3.8% for the year ended December 31, 2018. This compares to net income of $1.1 billion, operating income of $1.0 billion, and operating margin of 14.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Diluted earnings per share were $0.60 for 2018 compared to $3.41 for the same period in 2017.\nOur 2018 and 2017 reported results included the effects of special items and the implementation of new tax reform legislation. Adjusting for these one-time items, our net income was $487 million, operating income was $723 million, and operating margin was 9.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018. This compares to adjusted net income of $574 million, operating income of $1.0 billion, and operating margin of 14.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Excluding one-time items, diluted earnings per shares was $1.55 and $1.74 for 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nOperating Revenues\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(revenues in millions; percent changes based on unrounded numbers)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year-over-Year Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Passenger revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average fare\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>175.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Yield per passenger mile (cents)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Passenger revenue per ASM (cents)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenue per ASM (cents)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average stage length (miles)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue passengers (thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue passenger miles (millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Available seat miles (ASMs) (millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Load factor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPassenger revenue accounted for 96.4% of our total operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition to seat revenue, passenger revenue includes revenue from our ancillary product offerings such as Even More\u00ae Space. Revenue generated from international routes, including Puerto Rico, accounted for 29.7% of our passenger revenues in 2018. Passenger revenue, including certain ancillary fees directly related to passenger tickets, is recognized when the transportation is provided. Passenger revenue from unused tickets and passenger credits are recognized in proportion to flown revenue based on estimates of expected expiration or when the likelihood of the Customer exercising his or her remaining rights becomes remote. We measure capacity in terms of available seat miles, which represents the number of seats available for passengers multiplied by the number of miles the seats are flown. Yield, or the average amount one passenger pays to fly one mile, is calculated by dividing Passenger revenue by Revenue passenger miles. We attempt to increase Passenger revenue primarily by increasing our yield per flight which produces higher revenue per available seat mile. Our objective is to optimize our fare mix to increase our overall average fare while continuing to provide our Customers with competitive fares.\nIn 2018, the increase in Passenger revenue was mainly attributable to a 5.3% increase in revenue passengers and a 3.7% increase in average fare. Fee revenue increased by $60 million as a result of changes in our baggage and change fee policies. Our largest ancillary product remains the Even More\u00ae Space seats, generating approximately $274 million in revenue, an increase of over 14% compared to 2017.\nOther revenue is primarily comprised of the marketing component of the sales of our TrueBlue\u00ae points. It also includes revenue from the sale of vacations packages, ground handling fees received from other airlines, and rental income.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions; per ASM data in cents; percentages based on unrounded numbers)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year-over-Year Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>per ASM\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aircraft fuel and related taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries, wages and benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Landing fees and other rents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.82\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aircraft rent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance, materials and repairs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Special items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.73\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAircraft Fuel and Related Taxes\nAircraft fuel and related taxes represented 26% of our total operating expenses in 2018 compared to 23% in 2017. The average fuel price increased 30.2% in 2018 to $2.24 per gallon. This was coupled with an increase in our fuel consumption of approximately 57 million gallons. Additional fuel consumption was mainly due to our increase in the average number of operating aircraft. Based on our expected fuel volume for 2019, a 10% per gallon increase in the cost of aircraft fuel would increase our annual fuel expense by approximately $180 million.\nIn 2018, we recognized fuel hedge losses of $2 million compared to $15 million in fuel hedge gains in 2017 and these were recorded in Aircraft fuel and related taxes. We are unable to predict the potential loss of hedge accounting, which is determined on a derivative-by-derivative basis, due to the volatility in the forward markets for these commodities.\nSalaries, Wages and Benefits\nSalaries, wages and benefits represented 28% of our total operating expenses in 2018 compared to 31% in 2017. The increase in salaries, wages and benefits was primarily driven by the incremental costs of the new pilots' collective bargaining agreement which became effective on August 1, 2018. Our Crewmember headcount also increased year-over-year. During 2018, the average number of full-time equivalent Crewmembers increased by 4% and the average tenure of our Crewmembers was 7 years. The increasing tenure of our Crewmembers, rising healthcare costs and efforts to maintain competitiveness in our overall compensation packages will continue to pressure our costs in 2019.\nOur profit sharing is calculated as 10% of adjusted pre-tax income excluding special items, and reduced by Retirement Plus contributions. Profit sharing decreased by $38 million in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily driven by higher fuel prices which negatively impacted our adjusted pre-tax income. Refer to Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nLanding Fees and Other Rents\nLanding fees and other rents include landing fees, which are at premium rates in the heavily trafficked northeast corridor of the U.S. where approximately 75% of our operations reside. Other rents primarily consist of rent for airports in our 105 BlueCities. Landing fees and other rents increased $23 million, or 5.8%, in 2018 primarily due to our increased number of departures.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization primarily include depreciation for our owned and capital leased aircraft, engines, and in-flight entertainment systems. Depreciation and amortization increased $45 million, or 9.9%, primarily driven by a 5.7% increase in the average number of aircraft operating in 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.\nMaintenance, Materials and Repairs\nMaintenance, materials and repairs are generally expensed when incurred unless covered by a long-term flight hour services contract. The average age of our aircraft in 2018 was 9.8 years which is relatively young compared to our competitors. However, as our fleet ages our maintenance costs will increase significantly, both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of our unit costs, as older aircraft require additional, more expensive repairs over time. We had an average of 13.3 additional total operating aircraft in 2018 compared to 2017.\nIn 2018, Maintenance, materials and repairs increased by $3 million, or 0.5% compared to 2017. The marginal increase was primarily driven by a change in the pricing structure of our Airbus A320 engine maintenance program which became effective in September 2017 and the timing of engine overhauls.\nOther Operating Expenses\nOther operating expenses consist of the following categories: outside services (including expenses related to fueling, ground handling, skycap, security and janitorial services), insurance, personnel expenses, professional fees, onboard supplies, shop and office supplies, bad debts, communication costs, and taxes other than payroll and fuel taxes.\nIn 2018, Other operating expenses increased by $126 million, or 13.5%, compared to 2017, primarily due to an increase in airport services and passenger onboard supplies resulting from an increased number of passengers flown and additional Mint\u00ae offerings.\nSpecial Items\nSpecial items in 2018 consist of $362 million of impairment and one-time transition costs related to our Embraer E190 fleet exit, and $73 million of one-time costs related to the ratification of our pilots' collective bargaining agreement.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate was 13.9% in 2018, compared to a benefit of 23.0% in 2017. Our 2018 and 2017 effective tax rate included a fourth quarter 2018 benefit of $17 million related to implementation of various provisions of the new tax legislation and $551 million benefit in 2017 related to the remeasurement of our deferred taxes at the time the new tax legislation was enacted. We estimate that our underlying tax rate in 2019 will be approximately 26%.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nOverview\nWe reported net income of $1.1 billion, operating income of $1.0 billion and operating margin of 14.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017. This compares to net income of $727 million, operating income of $1.3 billion and operating margin of 19.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Diluted earnings per share were $3.41 for 2017 compared to $2.13 for the same period in 2016.\nApproximately 75% of our operations are centered in and around the heavily populated northeast corridor of the U.S., which includes the New York and Boston metropolitan areas. During the third quarter of 2017, we saw unprecedented weather challenges for JetBlue and the entire airline industry, with two large hurricanes impacting our network. We estimate that, due to the severe hurricane season, revenue was negatively impacted by approximately $110 million for the full year 2017. Revenue per available seat mile (RASM) was negatively impacted by approximately 0.3 points for the full year by the hurricanes. Operating income was negatively impacted by approximately $82 million.\nOperating Revenues\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(revenues in millions; percent changes based on unrounded numbers)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year-over-Year Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Passenger revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average fare\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>166.74\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Yield per passenger mile (cents)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Passenger revenue per ASM (cents)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenue per ASM (cents)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average stage length (miles)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue passengers (thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue passenger miles (millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Available seat miles (ASMs) (millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Load factor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPassenger revenue accounted for over 96.4% of our total operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition to seat revenue, passenger revenue includes revenue from our ancillary product offerings such as Even More\u00ae Space. Revenue generated from international routes, including Puerto Rico, accounted for 28.7% of our passenger revenues in 2017. Passenger revenue, including certain ancillary fees directly related to passenger tickets, is recognized when the transportation is provided. Passenger revenue from unused tickets and passenger credits are recognized in proportion to flown revenue based on estimates of expected expiration or when the likelihood of the Customer exercising his or her remaining rights becomes remote. We measure capacity in terms of available seat miles, which represents the number of seats available for passengers multiplied by the number of miles the seats are flown. Yield, or the average amount one passenger pays to fly one mile, is calculated by dividing Passenger revenue by Revenue passenger miles. We attempt to increase Passenger revenue primarily by increasing our yield per flight which produces higher Revenue per available seat mile. Our objective is to optimize our fare mix to increase our overall average fare while continuing to provide our Customers with competitive fares.\nIn 2017, the increase in Passenger revenue was mainly attributable to a 4.6% increase in revenue passengers and a 1.3% increase in average fare. Fee revenue increased by $47 million primarily resulting from changes in our baggage fee policy. Our largest ancillary product was Even More\u00ae Space, generating approximately $241 million in revenue, an increase of 2% compared to 2016.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions; per ASM data in cents; percentages based on unrounded numbers)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year-over-Year Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>per ASM\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aircraft fuel and related taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries, wages and benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,698\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Landing fees and other rents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.67\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.73\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aircraft rent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance, materials and repairs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAircraft Fuel and Related Taxes\nAircraft fuel and related taxes represented 23% of our total operating expenses in 2017 compared to 20% in 2016. The average fuel price increased 22.0% in 2017 to $1.72 per gallon. This was coupled with an increase in our fuel consumption of approximately 32 million gallons. Additional fuel consumption was mainly due to our increase in capacity.\nIn 2017, we recognized fuel hedge gains of $15 million compared to $9 million in 2016 which were recorded in Aircraft fuel and related taxes.\nSalaries, Wages and Benefits\nSalaries, wages and benefits represented approximately 31% of our total operating expenses in 2017 compared to 32% in 2016. The increase in salaries, wages and benefits was primarily driven by an increase in our Crewmember headcount and an 8% raise for profit sharing eligible Crewmembers effective January 1, 2017 and a modified profit sharing plan.\nOur profit sharing is calculated as 10% of adjusted pre-tax income, reduced by Retirement Plus contributions. Profit sharing decreased by $133 million in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by our change in policy. During 2017, the average number of full-time equivalent Crewmembers increased by 9% and the average tenure of our Crewmembers was 6.6 years.\nRetirement Plus contributions, which equate to 5% of all of our eligible Crewmembers wages, increased by $13 million and our 3% retirement contribution for a certain portion of our FAA-licensed Crewmembers, which we refer to as Retirement Advantage, increased by approximately $3 million.\nLanding Fees and Other Rents\nLanding fees and other rents include landing fees, which are at premium rates in the heavily trafficked northeast corridor of the U.S. where approximately 75% of our operations resided. Other rents primarily consisted of rent for airports in our 101 BlueCities. Landing fees and other rents increased $40 million, or 11.1%, in 2017 primarily due to increased departures.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization primarily include depreciation for our owned and capital leased aircraft, engines, and in-flight entertainment systems. Depreciation and amortization increased $53 million, or 13.7%, primarily driven by a 6.7% increase in the average number of aircraft operating in 2017 compared to the same period in 2016.\nMaintenance, Materials and Repairs\nMaintenance, materials and repairs are generally expensed when incurred unless covered by a long-term flight hour services contract. The average age of our aircraft in 2017 was 9.2 years which was relatively young compared to our competitors. We had an average of 14.6 additional total operating aircraft in 2017 compared to 2016. In 2017, Maintenance, materials and repairs increased by $59 million, or 10.5% compared to 2016, primarily driven by increased flight hours on our engine flight-hour based maintenance agreements and by the number of airframe heavy maintenance repairs.\nOther Operating Expenses\nOther operating expenses consist of the following categories: outside services (including expenses related to fueling, ground handling, skycap, security and janitorial services), insurance, personnel expenses, professional fees, onboard supplies, shop and office supplies, bad debts, communication costs and taxes other than payroll and fuel taxes.\nIn 2017, Other operating expenses increased by $67 million, or 7.6%, compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in airport services and passenger onboard supplies resulting from an increased number of passengers flown.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate was a benefit of 23.0% in 2017, compared to our effective tax rate of 37.6% in 2016. Our effective tax rate decreased primarily due to a one-time benefit of $551 million from the remeasurement of our deferred taxes to reflect the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe airline business is capital intensive. Our ability to successfully execute our profitable growth plans is largely dependent on the continued availability of capital on attractive terms. In addition, our ability to successfully operate our business depends on maintaining sufficient liquidity. We believe we have adequate resources from a combination of cash and cash equivalents, investment securities on-hand, and two available lines of credit. Additionally, as of December 31, 2018, we had 107 unencumbered aircraft and 44 unencumbered spare engines which we believe could be an additional source of liquidity, if necessary.\nWe believe a healthy liquidity position is a crucial element of our ability to weather any part of the economic cycle while continuing to execute on our plans for profitable growth and increased returns. Our goal is to continue to be diligent with our liquidity, maintaining financial flexibility and allowing for prudent capital spending.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $474 million and short-term investments of $413 million. We believe our current level of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately 12% of trailing twelve months revenue, combined with our approximately $625 million in available lines of credit and our portfolio of unencumbered assets, provides a strong liquidity position. We believe we have taken several important steps during 2018 in solidifying our strong balance sheet and overall liquidity position. Our adjusted debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2018 was 34%.\nAnalysis of Cash Flows\nWe had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $474 million as of December 31, 2018. This compares to $303 million and $433 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We held both short and long-term investments in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Our short-term investments totaled $413 million as of December 31, 2018 compared to $390 million and $538 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our long-term investments totaled $3 million as of December 31, 2018 compared to $2 million and $90 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOperating Activities\nCash flows provided by operating activities totaled approximately $1.2 billion in 2018, compared to $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion in 2017 and 2016, respectively. There was a $179 million decrease in cash flows from operating activities in 2018 compared to 2017. Lower earnings, principally driven by an increase in aircraft fuel expenses, partially offset by higher operating revenues, contributed to this reduction. The $236 million decrease in cash flows from operations in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily a result of a 22.0% increase in the price of fuel. As of December 31, 2018, our unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as a percentage of trailing twelve months revenue was approximately 12%. We rely primarily on cash flows from operations to provide working capital for current and future operations.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring 2018, capital expenditures related to our purchase of flight equipment included $519 million for the purchase of 10 new Airbus A321 aircraft and the buyout of two aircraft leases, $206 million for flight equipment deposits, $163 million for flight equipment work-in-progress, and $130 million for spare part purchases. Other property and equipment capital expenditures included ground equipment purchases and facilities improvements for $97 million. Investing activities also included the net purchase of $28 million in investment securities.\nDuring 2017, capital expenditures related to our purchase of flight equipment included $759 million for the purchase of 16 new Airbus A321 aircraft and the buyout of three aircraft leases, $128 million for flight equipment deposits, $156 million for flight equipment work-in-progress, and $61 million for spare part purchases. Other property and equipment capital expenditures included ground equipment purchases and facilities improvements for $98 million. Investing activities also included the net purchase of $236 million in investment securities.\nDuring 2016, capital expenditures related to our purchase of flight equipment included $588 million for the purchase of 10 new Airbus A321 aircraft, and the buyout of nine aircraft leases, $161 million for flight equipment deposits, $96 million for flight equipment work-in-progress, and $18 million for spare part purchases. Other property and equipment capital expenditures included ground equipment purchases and facilities improvements for $148 million. Investing activities also included the net purchase of $23 million in investment securities.\nWe currently anticipate 2019 capital expenditures to be between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion, including approximately $1.05 billion and $1.2 billion related to aircraft and predelivery deposits. The remaining capital expenditures of approximately $150 million to $200 million relate to non-aircraft projects.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing activities during 2018 consisted of the issuance of $687 million of debt partially offset by the scheduled repayment of $222 million in debt and capital lease obligations. In addition, we acquired $382 million in treasury shares of which $375 million related to our accelerated share repurchases during 2018. During this period, we realized $48 million in proceeds from the issuance of stock related to employee share-based compensation.\nFinancing activities during 2017 consisted of the scheduled repayment of $194 million relating to debt and capital lease obligations, as a result, three aircraft became unencumbered. In addition, we acquired $390 million in treasury shares of which $380 million related to our accelerated share repurchases during 2017. During this period, we realized $48 million in proceeds from the issuance of stock related to employee share-based compensation.\nFinancing activities during 2016 consisted of the scheduled repayment of $368 million relating to debt and capital lease obligations, as a result, 17 aircraft became unencumbered. In addition, we acquired $134 million in treasury shares of which $120 million related to our accelerated share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2016. During this period, we realized $45 million in proceeds from the issuance of stock related to employee share-based compensation. During 2016, $86 million of our Series B 6.75% convertible debentures were converted by holders, as a result, we issued approximately 17.6 million shares of our common stock.\nIn November 2015, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the SEC. Under this shelf registration statement, we, or one or more selling security holders, had the capacity to offer and sell from time to time common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units, subscription rights, and pass-through certificates. Through to December 31, 2018, we had not issued any securities under this registration statement. We may utilize a replacement automatic shelf registration statement filed with the SEC, in the future to raise capital to fund the continued development of our products and services, the commercialization of our products and services or for other general corporate purposes.\nNone of our lenders or lessors are affiliated with us.\nCapital Resources\nWe have been able to generate sufficient funds from operations to meet our working capital requirements and we have historically paid cash or financed our aircraft through either secured debt or lease financing. As of December 31, 2018, we operated a fleet of 253 aircraft which included 43 Airbus A321 aircraft, 63 Airbus A320 aircraft and one Embraer E190 aircraft that were unencumbered. Of our remaining aircraft, 42 were under operating leases, six were financed under capital leases and 98 were financed by private and public secured debt. Additionally, we have 44 unencumbered spare engines. Approximately 35% of our property and equipment is pledged as security under various loan arrangements.\nDependent on market conditions, we anticipate using a mix of cash and debt financing for the expected deliveries of Airbus A321neo aircraft in 2019. To the extent we cannot secure financing on terms we deem attractive, we may be required to pay in cash, further modify our aircraft acquisition plans or incur higher than anticipated financing costs. Although we believe debt and/or lease financing should be available to us if needed, we cannot give assurance we will be able to secure financing on terms attractive to us, if at all.\nWorking Capital\nWe had a working capital deficit of $944 million as of December 31, 2018 compared to a deficit of $940 million as of December 31, 2017. Working capital deficits can be customary in the airline industry since air traffic liability is classified as a current liability.\nIn 2012, we entered into a revolving line of credit with Morgan Stanley for up to $200 million. This line of credit is secured by a portion of our investment securities held by Morgan Stanley and the borrowing amount may vary accordingly. This line of credit bears interest at a floating rate based upon the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus a margin. We did not borrow on this facility in 2018 or 2017 and the line was undrawn as of December 31, 2018.\nIn April 2017, we increased our Credit and Guaranty Agreement with Citibank, N.A. as the administrative agent to $425 million. The term of the Amended and Restated Facility runs through April 6, 2021. Borrowing under the Amended and Restated Facility bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR, plus a margin. The Amended and Restated Facility is secured by Slots at JFK, LaGuardia, Reagan National and certain other assets. The Amended and Restated Facility includes covenants that require us to maintain certain minimum balances in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, and unused commitments available under all revolving credit facilities. In addition, the covenants restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, issue preferred stock or pay dividends. During 2018 and 2017, we did not borrow on this facility and the line was undrawn as of December 31, 2018.\nWe expect to meet our obligations as they become due through available cash, investment securities and internally generated funds, supplemented as necessary by financing activities, as they may be available to us. We expect to generate positive working capital through our operations. However, we cannot predict what the effect on our business might be from the extremely competitive environment we are operating in or from events beyond our control, such as volatile fuel prices, economic conditions, weather-related disruptions, the spread of infectious diseases, the impact of airline bankruptcies, restructurings or consolidations, U.S. military actions or acts of terrorism. We believe there is sufficient liquidity available to us to meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nDebt and Capital Leases\nAs part of our efforts to effectively manage our balance sheet and improve return on invested capital, or ROIC, we expect to continue to actively manage our debt balances. Our approach to debt management includes managing the mix of fixed versus floating rate debt, annual maturities of debt and the weighted average cost of debt. Additionally, our unencumbered assets, including 107 aircraft and 44 engines, allow some flexibility in managing our cost of debt and capital requirements.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nOur noncancelable contractual obligations at December 31, 2018 include the following (in billions):\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments due in\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt and capital lease obligations(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Flight equipment obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other obligations(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes actual interest and estimated interest for floating-rate debt based on December 31, 2018 rates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Amounts include noncancelable commitments for the purchase of goods and services.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The interest rates are fixed for $1.4 billion of our debt and capital lease obligations, with the remaining $0.2 billion having floating interest rates. The floating interest rates adjust either quarterly or semi-annually based on LIBOR. The weighted average maturity of all of our debt was six years as of December 31, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we believe we were in compliance with the covenants of our debt and lease agreements and approximately 35% of our owned property and equipment were pledged as security under various loan agreements.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had operating lease obligations for 42 aircraft with lease terms that expire between 2019 and 2028. Our aircraft lease agreements contain termination provisions which include standard maintenance and return conditions. Our policy is to record these lease return conditions when they are probable and the costs can be estimated. We also lease airport terminal space and other airport facilities in each of our markets, as well as office space and other equipment. We have approximately $31 million of restricted assets pledged under standby letters of credit related to certain of our leases which will expire at the end of the related leases. As of December 31, 2018, the average age of our operating fleet was 9.8 years.\nOur firm aircraft order book as of December 31, 2018 is as follows:\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Airbus A321neo\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Airbus A220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>145\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn October 2018, we received notice from Airbus of anticipated delivery delays of the A321neo aircraft. The table above represents the current delivery schedule set forth in our Airbus order book as of December 31, 2018. However, due to delays, we expect a delivery of a minimum of six Airbus A321neo aircraft in 2019.\nIn July 2018, we entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) for 60 Airbus A220-300 aircraft, previously called the Bombardier CS300, for delivery beginning in 2020, and the option for 60 additional aircraft beginning in 2025. The MOU was finalized into a purchase agreement in December 2018.\nCommitted expenditures for our firm aircraft and spare engines include estimated amounts for contractual price escalations and predelivery deposits. We expect to meet our predelivery deposit requirements for our aircraft by paying cash or by using short-term borrowing facilities for deposits generally required six to 24 months prior to delivery. Any predelivery deposits paid by the issuance of notes are fully repaid at the time of delivery of the related aircraft.\nOur Terminal at JFK, T5, is governed by a lease agreement we entered into with the PANYNJ in 2005. We are responsible for making various payments under the lease. This includes ground rents for the terminal site which began at the time of the lease execution in 2005 and facility rents commenced in October 2008 upon our occupancy of T5. The facility rents are based on the number of passengers enplaned out of the terminal, subject to annual minimums. The PANYNJ reimbursed us for construction costs of this project in accordance with the terms of the lease, except for approximately $76 million in leasehold improvements provided by us. In 2013, we amended this lease to include additional ground space for our international arrivals facility, T5i, which we opened in November 2014. For financial reporting purposes, the T5 project is being accounted for as a financing obligation, with the constructed asset and related liability being reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. The T5i project was accounted for at cost. Minimum ground and facility rents at JFK totaling $272 million are included in the commitments table above as lease commitments and financing obligations.\nWe enter into individual employment agreements with each of our non-unionized FAA-licensed Crewmembers, inspectors, and air traffic controllers. Each employment agreement is for a term of five years and automatically renews for an additional five-year term unless the Crewmember is terminated for cause or the Crewmember elects not to renew it. Pursuant to these agreements, these Crewmembers can only be terminated for cause. In the event of a downturn in our business requiring a reduction in flying and related work hours, we are obligated to pay these Crewmembers a guaranteed level of income and to continue their benefits. As we are not currently obligated to pay this guaranteed income and benefits, no amounts related to these guarantees are included in the contractual obligations table above.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nNone of our operating lease obligations are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. Although some of our aircraft lease arrangements are with variable interest entities, as defined by the Consolidations topic of the Codification, none of them require consolidation in our financial statements. The decision to finance these aircraft through operating leases rather than through debt was based on an analysis of the cash flows and tax consequences of each financing alternative and a consideration of liquidity implications. We are responsible for all maintenance, insurance, and other costs associated with operating these aircraft. However, we are not obligated to provide any residual value or other guarantees to our lessors.\nWe have determined that we hold a variable interest in, but are not the primary beneficiary of, certain pass-through trusts. The beneficiaries of these pass-through trusts are the purchasers of equipment notes issued by us to finance the acquisition of aircraft. Each trust maintains a liquidity facility whereby a third party agrees to make payments sufficient to pay up to 18 months of interest on the applicable certificates if a payment default occurs.\nWe have also made certain guarantees and indemnities to other unrelated parties that are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets, which we believe will not have a significant impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. We have no other off-balance sheet arrangements. See Notes 3, 4 and 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our variable interests and other contingencies, including guarantees and indemnities.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies as well as make estimates and judgments to develop amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes. We maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the estimates that are required to prepare our financial statements. We believe our estimates and judgments are reasonable; however, actual results and the timing of recognition of such amounts could differ from those estimates. In addition, estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties that could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The policies and estimates discussed below have been reviewed with our independent registered public accounting firm and with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For a discussion of these and other significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPassenger Revenue\nTicket sales and the fees collected for related ancillary services are initially deferred in air traffic liability. Air traffic liability represents tickets sold but not yet flown, credits which can be used for future travel and a portion of the liability related to our TrueBlue\u00ae loyalty program. We allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation identified in a passenger ticket on a relative standalone basis. Passenger revenue, including certain ancillary fees directly related to passenger tickets, is recognized when the transportation is provided. Taxes that we are required to collect from our Customers, including foreign and U.S. federal transportation taxes, security taxes, and airport facility charges, are excluded from passenger revenue. Those taxes and fees are recorded as a liability upon collection and are relieved from the liability upon remittance to the applicable governmental agency.\nThe majority of the tickets sold are non-refundable. Non-refundable fares may be canceled prior to the scheduled departure date for a credit for future travel. Refundable fares may be canceled at any time prior to the scheduled departure date. Failure to cancel a refundable fare prior to departure will result in the cancellation of original ticket and an issuance of a credit for future travel. Passenger credits can be used for future travel up to a year from the date of issuance. Passenger breakage revenue from unused tickets and passenger credits will be recognized in proportion to flown revenue based on estimates of expected expiration of when the likelihood of the Customer exercising his or her remaining rights becomes remote. Breakage revenue consists of nonrefundable tickets that remain unused past the departure date, have continued validity, and are expected to ultimately expire unused, as well as passenger credits that are not expected to be redeemed prior to expiration. JetBlue used estimates based on historical experience of expired tickets and credits and considered other factors that could impact future expiration patterns of tickets and credits. Tickets which do not have continued validity past the departure date are recognized as revenue after the scheduled departure date has lapsed.\nPassenger ticket costs primarily include credit card fees, commissions paid, and global distribution systems booking fees. Costs are allocated entirely to the purchased travel services and are capitalized until recognized when travel services are provided to the Customer.\nLoyalty Program\nCustomers may earn points under our customer loyalty program, TrueBlue\u00ae, based on the fare paid and fare product purchased for a flight. Customers can also earn points through business partners such as credit card companies, hotels, car rental companies, and our participating airline partners.\nPoints Earned From a Ticket Purchase. When a TrueBlue\u00ae member travels, we recognize a portion of the fare as revenue and defer in air traffic liabilities the portion that represents the value of the points net of spoilage, or breakage. We allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone basis. We determine the standalone selling price of TrueBlue\u00ae points issued using the redemption value approach. To maximize the use of observable inputs, we utilize the actual ticket value of the tickets purchased with TrueBlue\u00ae points. The liability is relieved and passenger revenue is recognized when the points are redeemed and the free travel is provided.\nPoints Sold to TrueBlue\u00ae Partners. Our most significant contract to sell TrueBlue\u00ae points is with our co-branded credit card partner. Co-branded credit card partnerships have the following identified performance obligations: air transportation; use of the JetBlue brand name, and access to our frequent flyer customer lists; advertising; and other airline benefits. In\ndetermining the estimated selling price, JetBlue considered multiple inputs, methods and assumptions, including: discounted cash flows; estimated redemption value, net of fulfillment discount; points expected to be awarded and redeemed; estimated annual spending by cardholders; estimated annual royalty for use of JetBlue's frequent flyer customer lists; and estimated utilization of other airline benefits. Payments are typically due monthly based on the volume of miles sold during the period, and the terms of our marketing contracts are generally from one to seven years. The overall consideration received is allocated to each performance obligation based on their standalone relative selling prices. The air transportation element is deferred and recognized as passenger revenue when the points are utilized. The other elements are recognized as other revenue when the performance obligation related to those service are satisfied, which is generally the same period as when consideration is received from the participating company.\nAmounts allocated to the air transportation element which are initially deferred include a portion that are expected to be redeemed during the following twelve months (classified as a component of Air traffic liability), and a portion that are not expected to be redeemed during the following twelve months (classified as Air traffic liability - loyalty non-current). We periodically update this analysis and adjust the split between current and non-current liabilities as appropriate.\nPoints earned by TrueBlue\u00ae members never expire. TrueBlue\u00ae members can pool points between small groups of people, branded as Points Pooling\u2122. Breakage is estimate using historical redemption patterns to determine a breakage rate. Breakage rates used to estimate breakage revenue are evaluated annually. Changes to breakage estimates impact revenue recognition prospectively.\nAccounting for Long-Lived Assets\nIn accounting for long-lived assets, we make estimates about the expected useful lives, projected residual values and the potential for impairment. In estimating useful lives and residual values of our aircraft, we have relied upon actual industry experience with the same or similar aircraft types and our anticipated utilization of the aircraft. Changing market prices of new and used aircraft, government regulations and changes in our maintenance program or operations could result in changes to these estimates.\nOur long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired. Indicators include operating or cash flow losses, significant decreases in market value, or changes in technology.\nTo determine whether impairment exist for aircraft used in operations, we group assets at the fleet-type level (the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows) and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of capacity, passenger yield, fuel costs, labor costs, and other relevant factors. If an impairment occurs, the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the fleet's carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value. We estimate aircraft fair value using published sources, appraisals, and bids received from third parties, as available.\nIn 2018, we recorded an impairment charge of flight equipment and other property and equipment related to the Embraer E190 fleet transition. Refer to Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for details.\nLease Accounting\nWe operate airport facilities, office buildings, and aircraft under operating leases with minimum lease payments. We recognize the costs associated with these agreements as rent expense on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term. Within the provisions of certain leases, there are minimum escalations in payments over the base lease term. There are also periodic adjustments of lease rates, landing fees, and other charges applicable under such agreements, as well as renewal periods. The effects of the escalations and other adjustments have been reflected in rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. This includes renewal periods when it is deemed to be reasonably assured at the inception of the lease that we would incur an economic penalty for not renewing. The amortization period for leasehold improvements is the term used in calculating straight-line rent expense or their estimated economic life, whichever is shorter.\nDerivative Instruments used for Aircraft Fuel\nWe utilize financial derivative instruments to manage the risk of changing aircraft fuel prices. We do not purchase or hold any derivative instrument for trading purposes. Fair values are determined using commodity prices provided to us by independent third parties. When possible, we designate these instruments as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes, as defined by the Derivatives and Hedging topic of the Codification which permits the deferral of the effective portions of gains or losses until contract settlement.\nThe Derivatives and Hedging topic is a complex accounting standard. It requires us to develop and maintain a significant amount of documentation related to:\n(1) our fuel hedging program and fuel management approach,\n(2) statistical analysis supporting a highly correlated relationship between the underlying commodity in the derivative financial instrument and the risk being hedged, i.e. aircraft fuel, on both a historical and prospective basis, and\n(3) cash flow designation for each hedging transaction executed, to be developed concurrently with the hedging transaction.\nThis documentation requires us to estimate forward aircraft fuel prices since there is no reliable forward market for aircraft fuel. These prices are developed through the observation of similar commodity futures prices, such as crude oil and/or heating oil, and adjusted based on variations to those like commodities. Historically, our hedges have settled within 24 months; therefore, the deferred gains and losses have been recognized into earnings over a relatively short period of time.\nREGULATION G RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nWe sometimes use non-GAAP measures that are derived from the consolidated financial statements, but that are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or U.S. GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide a meaningful comparison of our results to others in the airline industry and our prior year results. Investors should consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, our financial performance measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Further, our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies. We believe certain charges included in our operating expenses on a GAAP basis make it difficult to compare our current period results to prior periods as well as future periods and guidance. The tables below show a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used in this filing to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nOperating Expenses per Available Seat Mile, excluding fuel\nOperating expenses per available seat mile, or CASM, is a common metric used in the airline industry. Our CASM for 2018 through 2014 are summarized in the table below. We exclude aircraft fuel and related taxes, operating expenses related to other non-airline businesses, such as JetBlue Technology Ventures and JetBlue Travel Products, and special items from operating expenses to determine CASM ex-fuel. During the periods presented below, special items consisted of the impairment and one-time costs related to the Embraer E190 fleet transition, as well as one-time costs related to the ratification of our pilots' collective bargaining agreement. We believe that CASM ex-fuel provides investors with the ability to measure financial performance excluding items beyond our control, such as fuel costs which are subject to many economic and political factors, or not related to the generation of an available seat mile, such as operating expense related to other non-airline businesses. We believe this non-GAAP measure is more indicative of our ability to manage airline costs and is more comparable to measures reported by other major airlines.\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation of Operating expense per ASM, excluding fuel\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions; per ASM data in cents)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>per ASM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>per ASM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>per ASM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>per ASM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>per ASM\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.78\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aircraft fuel and related taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.74\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other non-airline expenses(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Special items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.73\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses, excluding fuel\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.82\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.53\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Amounts prior to 2016 do not reflect the impact of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) of the Codification, in the first quarter of 2018. Refer to Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for details.\n(2) Other non-airline expenses for 2016 includes operating expenses related to JetBlue Technology Ventures only.\nReconciliation of Operating Expense, Income before Taxes, Net Income and Earnings per Share, excluding Tax Reform Impact and Special Items\nOur GAAP results in the applicable periods include the impacts of the 2017 tax reform and charges that are deemed special items which we believe make our results difficult to compare to prior periods as well as future periods and guidance. During the periods presented below, special items consisted of the impairment and one-time costs related to the Embraer E190 fleet transition, as well as one-time costs related to the ratification of our pilots' collective bargaining agreement. We believe the impacts of the 2017 tax reform and special items distort our overall trends and that our metrics and results are enhanced with the presentation of our results excluding the impact of these items. The table below provides a reconciliation of our GAAP reported amounts to the non-GAAP amounts excluding the impact of the 2017 tax reform and special items.\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td>

generate returns relative to the capital invested in our business. During 2018, our ROIC was 8.6% compared to 10.4% in 2017, primarily due to the increase in fuel prices. We are committed to taking appropriate actions which will allow us to produce returns greater than our cost of capital while adding capacity and continuing to grow.\nWe believe this non-GAAP measure provides a meaningful comparison of our results to the airline industry and our prior year results.

In making the adjustment we used a multiple of seven times our aircraft rent as this is the multiple which is routinely used within the airline community to represent the financing component of aircraft operating lease obligations.\n(3) During the periods presented above, special items include the impairment and one-time costs related to the Embraer E190 fleet transition as well as one-time costs related to the ratification of our pilots' collective bargaining agreement.\nFree Cash Flow (Non-GAAP)\nThe table below reconciles cash provided by operations determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP to Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP measure.

7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nIn 2018, we experienced the persistent competitiveness of the airline industry and the impact of the volatility in the price of jet fuel. Even with these external factors, we managed to generate operating revenue growth of almost 9.2% year-over-year. We remain committed to striving to deliver a safe and reliable JetBlue Experience for our Customers and increasing returns for our Shareholders. We believe our continued focus on cost discipline, product innovation and network enhancements, combined with our commitment to service excellence, will drive our future success.\n2018 Highlights\n\u2022We generated $7.7 billion in operating revenue, an increase of $646 million compared to 2017 due primarily to a 5.3% increase in revenue passengers and a 3.7% increase in average fare.\n\u2022Our earnings per diluted share were $0.60. Our results included pre-tax charges of $435 million related to one-time costs associated with the ratification of our pilots' collective bargaining agreement and the transition of our Embraer E190 fleet. Our earnings per share also included a fourth quarter tax benefit of $17 million. Excluding these items, our diluted earnings per share would be $1.55.\n\u2022We generated $1.2 billion in cash from operations. The significant amount of cash we generated provided the opportunity to pay cash for all 2018 aircraft deliveries, buy out two aircraft leases, invest in our infrastructure and customer experience, and execute share repurchases.\n\u2022Operating expenses per available seat mile increased 14.5% to 12.31 cents, primarily driven by an increase in aircraft fuel expense and the pre-tax charges mentioned above. Excluding fuel and related taxes, operating expenses related to our non-airline businesses, and the pre-tax charges for special items, our cost per available seat mile increased 1.1% in 2018.\nCompany Initiatives\nBalance Sheet\nWe ended 2018 with unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $887 million and undrawn lines of credit of approximately $625 million. In June 2017, Moody's Investor Service upgraded our debt rating to Ba1 from Ba3 with a stable outlook reflecting the strength of our financial position. In November 2017, Standard & Poor's Rating Services upgraded our debt rating to BB from BB- with a stable outlook. At December 31, 2018, unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was approximately 12% of trailing twelve months revenue. In 2018, we repaid $222 million of regularly scheduled debt and raised $687 million in secured aircraft debt. We had 107 unencumbered aircraft and 44 unencumbered spare engines as of December 31, 2018. During 2018, we acquired approximately 19.1 million shares of our common stock for approximately $375 million under our share repurchase program, returning excess capital to our Shareholders. Our adjusted debt to capitalization ratio was 34% at December 31, 2018.\nAircraft and Airport Infrastructure Investments\nDuring 2018, we took delivery of 10 Airbus A321 aircraft and bought out the leases on two aircraft, one of which was an Airbus A321 aircraft and the other was an Airbus A320 aircraft.\nIn 2018, we opened a new Federal Inspection Station, FIS, in Terminal A at Luis Munoz Marin International Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The FIS enables our international and domestic flights to arrive at the same terminal and thus provides a better experience to our Customers by reducing connection times.\nWe introduced self-tagging kiosks to eleven BlueCities in 2018: Las Vegas, Reagan National at Washington D.C., Fort Myers, Tampa, Seattle, Hartford, Salt Lake City, Philadelphia, Richmond, Pittsburgh, and Baltimore. Self-tagging kiosks were available at 23 of our BlueCities as of December 31, 2018. These kiosks helped streamline the airport experience for our Customers and we plan to introduce the improvements to additional BlueCities in 2019.\nNetwork\nAs part of our ongoing network initiatives and route optimization efforts, we continued to make schedule and frequency adjustments throughout 2018. As a result, we added four new destinations to our growing network and also new routes between existing BlueCities.\nOutlook for 2019\nWe believe we will improve our long-term return for Shareholders as we implement our structural cost initiatives. We plan to add new destinations and route pairings based upon market demand. We are continuously looking to expand our other ancillary revenue opportunities, improve our TrueBlue\u00ae loyalty program, and deepen our portfolio of commercial partnerships. As in the past, we intend to invest in infrastructure and product enhancements in 2019, which we believe will enable us to reap future benefits. We also plan to continue strengthening the balance sheet.\nFor the full year 2019, we estimate our operating capacity will increase by approximately 5.0% to 7.0% over 2018 with the expected delivery of six Airbus A321neo aircraft to our operating fleet. We are expecting our cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and related taxes, and operating expenses related to other non-airline businesses (CASM ex-fuel), for 2019 to increase by between approximately 0.0% to 2.0% over the level in 2018. We anticipate CASM ex-fuel growth to be higher in the first half of 2019 primarily driven by the pilots' collective bargaining agreement which became effective on August 1, 2018. We expect to see further benefits to CASM ex-fuel from the Structural Cost Program and greater impact from the Airbus A320 cabin restyle program during the second half of 2019.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n2018 Compared to 2017\nOverview\nWe reported net income of $188 million, operating income of $288 million and operating margin of 3.8% for the year ended December 31, 2018. This compares to net income of $1.1 billion, operating income of $1.0 billion, and operating margin of 14.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Diluted earnings per share were $0.60 for 2018 compared to $3.41 for the same period in 2017.\nOur 2018 and 2017 reported results included the effects of special items and the implementation of new tax reform legislation. Adjusting for these one-time items, our net income was $487 million, operating income was $723 million, and operating margin was 9.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018. This compares to adjusted net income of $574 million, operating income of $1.0 billion, and operating margin of 14.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Excluding one-time items, diluted earnings per shares was $1.55 and $1.74 for 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nOperating Revenues\n\nPassenger revenue accounted for 96.4% of our total operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition to seat revenue, passenger revenue includes revenue from our ancillary product offerings such as Even More\u00ae Space. Revenue generated from international routes, including Puerto Rico, accounted for 29.7% of our passenger revenues in 2018. Passenger revenue, including certain ancillary fees directly related to passenger tickets, is recognized when the transportation is provided. Passenger revenue from unused tickets and passenger credits are recognized in proportion to flown revenue based on estimates of expected expiration or when the likelihood of the Customer exercising his or her remaining rights becomes remote. We measure capacity in terms of available seat miles, which represents the number of seats available for passengers multiplied by the number of miles the seats are flown. Yield, or the average amount one passenger pays to fly one mile, is calculated by dividing Passenger revenue by Revenue passenger miles. We attempt to increase Passenger revenue primarily by increasing our yield per flight which produces higher revenue per available seat mile. Our objective is to optimize our fare mix to increase our overall average fare while continuing to provide our Customers with competitive fares.\nIn 2018, the increase in Passenger revenue was mainly attributable to a 5.3% increase in revenue passengers and a 3.7% increase in average fare. Fee revenue increased by $60 million as a result of changes in our baggage and change fee policies. Our largest ancillary product remains the Even More\u00ae Space seats, generating approximately $274 million in revenue, an increase of over 14% compared to 2017.\nOther revenue is primarily comprised of the marketing component of the sales of our TrueBlue\u00ae points. It also includes revenue from the sale of vacations packages, ground handling fees received from other airlines, and rental income.\nOperating Expenses\n\nAircraft Fuel and Related Taxes\nAircraft fuel and related taxes represented 26% of our total operating expenses in 2018 compared to 23% in 2017. The average fuel price increased 30.2% in 2018 to $2.24 per gallon. This was coupled with an increase in our fuel consumption of approximately 57 million gallons. Additional fuel consumption was mainly due to our increase in the average number of operating aircraft. Based on our expected fuel volume for 2019, a 10% per gallon increase in the cost of aircraft fuel would increase our annual fuel expense by approximately $180 million.\nIn 2018, we recognized fuel hedge losses of $2 million compared to $15 million in fuel hedge gains in 2017 and these were recorded in Aircraft fuel and related taxes. We are unable to predict the potential loss of hedge accounting, which is determined on a derivative-by-derivative basis, due to the volatility in the forward markets for these commodities.\nSalaries, Wages and Benefits\nSalaries, wages and benefits represented 28% of our total operating expenses in 2018 compared to 31% in 2017. The increase in salaries, wages and benefits was primarily driven by the incremental costs of the new pilots' collective bargaining agreement which became effective on August 1, 2018. Our Crewmember headcount also increased year-over-year. During 2018, the average number of full-time equivalent Crewmembers increased by 4% and the average tenure of our Crewmembers was 7 years. The increasing tenure of our Crewmembers, rising healthcare costs and efforts to maintain competitiveness in our overall compensation packages will continue to pressure our costs in 2019.\nOur profit sharing is calculated as 10% of adjusted pre-tax income excluding special items, and reduced by Retirement Plus contributions. Profit sharing decreased by $38 million in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily driven by higher fuel prices which negatively impacted our adjusted pre-tax income. Refer to Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nLanding Fees and Other Rents\nLanding fees and other rents include landing fees, which are at premium rates in the heavily trafficked northeast corridor of the U.S. where approximately 75% of our operations reside. Other rents primarily consist of rent for airports in our 105 BlueCities. Landing fees and other rents increased $23 million, or 5.8%, in 2018 primarily due to our increased number of departures.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization primarily include depreciation for our owned and capital leased aircraft, engines, and in-flight entertainment systems. Depreciation and amortization increased $45 million, or 9.9%, primarily driven by a 5.7% increase in the average number of aircraft operating in 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.\nMaintenance, Materials and Repairs\nMaintenance, materials and repairs are generally expensed when incurred unless covered by a long-term flight hour services contract. The average age of our aircraft in 2018 was 9.8 years which is relatively young compared to our competitors. However, as our fleet ages our maintenance costs will increase significantly, both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of our unit costs, as older aircraft require additional, more expensive repairs over time. We had an average of 13.3 additional total operating aircraft in 2018 compared to 2017.\nIn 2018, Maintenance, materials and repairs increased by $3 million, or 0.5% compared to 2017. The marginal increase was primarily driven by a change in the pricing structure of our Airbus A320 engine maintenance program which became effective in September 2017 and the timing of engine overhauls.\nOther Operating Expenses\nOther operating expenses consist of the following categories: outside services (including expenses related to fueling, ground handling, skycap, security and janitorial services), insurance, personnel expenses, professional fees, onboard supplies, shop and office supplies, bad debts, communication costs, and taxes other than payroll and fuel taxes.\nIn 2018, Other operating expenses increased by $126 million, or 13.5%, compared to 2017, primarily due to an increase in airport services and passenger onboard supplies resulting from an increased number of passengers flown and additional Mint\u00ae offerings.\nSpecial Items\nSpecial items in 2018 consist of $362 million of impairment and one-time transition costs related to our Embraer E190 fleet exit, and $73 million of one-time costs related to the ratification of our pilots' collective bargaining agreement.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate was 13.9% in 2018, compared to a benefit of 23.0% in 2017. Our 2018 and 2017 effective tax rate included a fourth quarter 2018 benefit of $17 million related to implementation of various provisions of the new tax legislation and $551 million benefit in 2017 related to the remeasurement of our deferred taxes at the time the new tax legislation was enacted. We estimate that our underlying tax rate in 2019 will be approximately 26%.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nOverview\nWe reported net income of $1.1 billion, operating income of $1.0 billion and operating margin of 14.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017. This compares to net income of $727 million, operating income of $1.3 billion and operating margin of 19.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Diluted earnings per share were $3.41 for 2017 compared to $2.13 for the same period in 2016.\nApproximately 75% of our operations are centered in and around the heavily populated northeast corridor of the U.S., which includes the New York and Boston metropolitan areas. During the third quarter of 2017, we saw unprecedented weather challenges for JetBlue and the entire airline industry, with two large hurricanes impacting our network. We estimate that, due to the severe hurricane season, revenue was negatively impacted by approximately $110 million for the full year 2017. Revenue per available seat mile (RASM) was negatively impacted by approximately 0.3 points for the full year by the hurricanes. Operating income was negatively impacted by approximately $82 million.\nOperating Revenues\n\nPassenger revenue accounted for over 96.4% of our total operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition to seat revenue, passenger revenue includes revenue from our ancillary product offerings such as Even More\u00ae Space. Revenue generated from international routes, including Puerto Rico, accounted for 28.7% of our passenger revenues in 2017. Passenger revenue, including certain ancillary fees directly related to passenger tickets, is recognized when the transportation is provided. Passenger revenue from unused tickets and passenger credits are recognized in proportion to flown revenue based on estimates of expected expiration or when the likelihood of the Customer exercising his or her remaining rights becomes remote. We measure capacity in terms of available seat miles, which represents the number of seats available for passengers multiplied by the number of miles the seats are flown. Yield, or the average amount one passenger pays to fly one mile, is calculated by dividing Passenger revenue by Revenue passenger miles. We attempt to increase Passenger revenue primarily by increasing our yield per flight which produces higher Revenue per available seat mile. Our objective is to optimize our fare mix to increase our overall average fare while continuing to provide our Customers with competitive fares.\nIn 2017, the increase in Passenger revenue was mainly attributable to a 4.6% increase in revenue passengers and a 1.3% increase in average fare. Fee revenue increased by $47 million primarily resulting from changes in our baggage fee policy. Our largest ancillary product was Even More\u00ae Space, generating approximately $241 million in revenue, an increase of 2% compared to 2016.\nOperating Expenses\n\nAircraft Fuel and Related Taxes\nAircraft fuel and related taxes represented 23% of our total operating expenses in 2017 compared to 20% in 2016. The average fuel price increased 22.0% in 2017 to $1.72 per gallon. This was coupled with an increase in our fuel consumption of approximately 32 million gallons. Additional fuel consumption was mainly due to our increase in capacity.\nIn 2017, we recognized fuel hedge gains of $15 million compared to $9 million in 2016 which were recorded in Aircraft fuel and related taxes.\nSalaries, Wages and Benefits\nSalaries, wages and benefits represented approximately 31% of our total operating expenses in 2017 compared to 32% in 2016. The increase in salaries, wages and benefits was primarily driven by an increase in our Crewmember headcount and an 8% raise for profit sharing eligible Crewmembers effective January 1, 2017 and a modified profit sharing plan.\nOur profit sharing is calculated as 10% of adjusted pre-tax income, reduced by Retirement Plus contributions. Profit sharing decreased by $133 million in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by our change in policy. During 2017, the average number of full-time equivalent Crewmembers increased by 9% and the average tenure of our Crewmembers was 6.6 years.\nRetirement Plus contributions, which equate to 5% of all of our eligible Crewmembers wages, increased by $13 million and our 3% retirement contribution for a certain portion of our FAA-licensed Crewmembers, which we refer to as Retirement Advantage, increased by approximately $3 million.\nLanding Fees and Other Rents\nLanding fees and other rents include landing fees, which are at premium rates in the heavily trafficked northeast corridor of the U.S. where approximately 75% of our operations resided. Other rents primarily consisted of rent for airports in our 101 BlueCities. Landing fees and other rents increased $40 million, or 11.1%, in 2017 primarily due to increased departures.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization primarily include depreciation for our owned and capital leased aircraft, engines, and in-flight entertainment systems. Depreciation and amortization increased $53 million, or 13.7%, primarily driven by a 6.7% increase in the average number of aircraft operating in 2017 compared to the same period in 2016.\nMaintenance, Materials and Repairs\nMaintenance, materials and repairs are generally expensed when incurred unless covered by a long-term flight hour services contract. The average age of our aircraft in 2017 was 9.2 years which was relatively young compared to our competitors. We had an average of 14.6 additional total operating aircraft in 2017 compared to 2016. In 2017, Maintenance, materials and repairs increased by $59 million, or 10.5% compared to 2016, primarily driven by increased flight hours on our engine flight-hour based maintenance agreements and by the number of airframe heavy maintenance repairs.\nOther Operating Expenses\nOther operating expenses consist of the following categories: outside services (including expenses related to fueling, ground handling, skycap, security and janitorial services), insurance, personnel expenses, professional fees, onboard supplies, shop and office supplies, bad debts, communication costs and taxes other than payroll and fuel taxes.\nIn 2017, Other operating expenses increased by $67 million, or 7.6%, compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in airport services and passenger onboard supplies resulting from an increased number of passengers flown.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate was a benefit of 23.0% in 2017, compared to our effective tax rate of 37.6% in 2016. Our effective tax rate decreased primarily due to a one-time benefit of $551 million from the remeasurement of our deferred taxes to reflect the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe airline business is capital intensive. Our ability to successfully execute our profitable growth plans is largely dependent on the continued availability of capital on attractive terms. In addition, our ability to successfully operate our business depends on maintaining sufficient liquidity. We believe we have adequate resources from a combination of cash and cash equivalents, investment securities on-hand, and two available lines of credit. Additionally, as of December 31, 2018, we had 107 unencumbered aircraft and 44 unencumbered spare engines which we believe could be an additional source of liquidity, if necessary.\nWe believe a healthy liquidity position is a crucial element of our ability to weather any part of the economic cycle while continuing to execute on our plans for profitable growth and increased returns. Our goal is to continue to be diligent with our liquidity, maintaining financial flexibility and allowing for prudent capital spending.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $474 million and short-term investments of $413 million. We believe our current level of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately 12% of trailing twelve months revenue, combined with our approximately $625 million in available lines of credit and our portfolio of unencumbered assets, provides a strong liquidity position. We believe we have taken several important steps during 2018 in solidifying our strong balance sheet and overall liquidity position. Our adjusted debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2018 was 34%.\nAnalysis of Cash Flows\nWe had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $474 million as of December 31, 2018. This compares to $303 million and $433 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We held both short and long-term investments in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Our short-term investments totaled $413 million as of December 31, 2018 compared to $390 million and $538 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our long-term investments totaled $3 million as of December 31, 2018 compared to $2 million and $90 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOperating Activities\nCash flows provided by operating activities totaled approximately $1.2 billion in 2018, compared to $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion in 2017 and 2016, respectively. There was a $179 million decrease in cash flows from operating activities in 2018 compared to 2017. Lower earnings, principally driven by an increase in aircraft fuel expenses, partially offset by higher operating revenues, contributed to this reduction. The $236 million decrease in cash flows from operations in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily a result of a 22.0% increase in the price of fuel. As of December 31, 2018, our unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as a percentage of trailing twelve months revenue was approximately 12%. We rely primarily on cash flows from operations to provide working capital for current and future operations.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring 2018, capital expenditures related to our purchase of flight equipment included $519 million for the purchase of 10 new Airbus A321 aircraft and the buyout of two aircraft leases, $206 million for flight equipment deposits, $163 million for flight equipment work-in-progress, and $130 million for spare part purchases. Other property and equipment capital expenditures included ground equipment purchases and facilities improvements for $97 million. Investing activities also included the net purchase of $28 million in investment securities.\nDuring 2017, capital expenditures related to our purchase of flight equipment included $759 million for the purchase of 16 new Airbus A321 aircraft and the buyout of three aircraft leases, $128 million for flight equipment deposits, $156 million for flight equipment work-in-progress, and $61 million for spare part purchases. Other property and equipment capital expenditures included ground equipment purchases and facilities improvements for $98 million. Investing activities also included the net purchase of $236 million in investment securities.\nDuring 2016, capital expenditures related to our purchase of flight equipment included $588 million for the purchase of 10 new Airbus A321 aircraft, and the buyout of nine aircraft leases, $161 million for flight equipment deposits, $96 million for flight equipment work-in-progress, and $18 million for spare part purchases. Other property and equipment capital expenditures included ground equipment purchases and facilities improvements for $148 million. Investing activities also included the net purchase of $23 million in investment securities.\nWe currently anticipate 2019 capital expenditures to be between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion, including approximately $1.05 billion and $1.2 billion related to aircraft and predelivery deposits. The remaining capital expenditures of approximately $150 million to $200 million relate to non-aircraft projects.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing activities during 2018 consisted of the issuance of $687 million of debt partially offset by the scheduled repayment of $222 million in debt and capital lease obligations. In addition, we acquired $382 million in treasury shares of which $375 million related to our accelerated share repurchases during 2018. During this period, we realized $48 million in proceeds from the issuance of stock related to employee share-based compensation.\nFinancing activities during 2017 consisted of the scheduled repayment of $194 million relating to debt and capital lease obligations, as a result, three aircraft became unencumbered. In addition, we acquired $390 million in treasury shares of which $380 million related to our accelerated share repurchases during 2017. During this period, we realized $48 million in proceeds from the issuance of stock related to employee share-based compensation.\nFinancing activities during 2016 consisted of the scheduled repayment of $368 million relating to debt and capital lease obligations, as a result, 17 aircraft became unencumbered. In addition, we acquired $134 million in treasury shares of which $120 million related to our accelerated share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2016. During this period, we realized $45 million in proceeds from the issuance of stock related to employee share-based compensation. During 2016, $86 million of our Series B 6.75% convertible debentures were converted by holders, as a result, we issued approximately 17.6 million shares of our common stock.\nIn November 2015, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the SEC. Under this shelf registration statement, we, or one or more selling security holders, had the capacity to offer and sell from time to time common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units, subscription rights, and pass-through certificates. Through to December 31, 2018, we had not issued any securities under this registration statement. We may utilize a replacement automatic shelf registration statement filed with the SEC, in the future to raise capital to fund the continued development of our products and services, the commercialization of our products and services or for other general corporate purposes.\nNone of our lenders or lessors are affiliated with us.\nCapital Resources\nWe have been able to generate sufficient funds from operations to meet our working capital requirements and we have historically paid cash or financed our aircraft through either secured debt or lease financing. As of December 31, 2018, we operated a fleet of 253 aircraft which included 43 Airbus A321 aircraft, 63 Airbus A320 aircraft and one Embraer E190 aircraft that were unencumbered. Of our remaining aircraft, 42 were under operating leases, six were financed under capital leases and 98 were financed by private and public secured debt. Additionally, we have 44 unencumbered spare engines. Approximately 35% of our property and equipment is pledged as security under various loan arrangements.\nDependent on market conditions, we anticipate using a mix of cash and debt financing for the expected deliveries of Airbus A321neo aircraft in 2019. To the extent we cannot secure financing on terms we deem attractive, we may be required to pay in cash, further modify our aircraft acquisition plans or incur higher than anticipated financing costs. Although we believe debt and/or lease financing should be available to us if needed, we cannot give assurance we will be able to secure financing on terms attractive to us, if at all.\nWorking Capital\nWe had a working capital deficit of $944 million as of December 31, 2018 compared to a deficit of $940 million as of December 31, 2017. Working capital deficits can be customary in the airline industry since air traffic liability is classified as a current liability.\nIn 2012, we entered into a revolving line of credit with Morgan Stanley for up to $200 million. This line of credit is secured by a portion of our investment securities held by Morgan Stanley and the borrowing amount may vary accordingly. This line of credit bears interest at a floating rate based upon the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus a margin. We did not borrow on this facility in 2018 or 2017 and the line was undrawn as of December 31, 2018.\nIn April 2017, we increased our Credit and Guaranty Agreement with Citibank, N.A. as the administrative agent to $425 million. The term of the Amended and Restated Facility runs through April 6, 2021. Borrowing under the Amended and Restated Facility bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR, plus a margin. The Amended and Restated Facility is secured by Slots at JFK, LaGuardia, Reagan National and certain other assets. The Amended and Restated Facility includes covenants that require us to maintain certain minimum balances in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, and unused commitments available under all revolving credit facilities. In addition, the covenants restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, issue preferred stock or pay dividends. During 2018 and 2017, we did not borrow on this facility and the line was undrawn as of December 31, 2018.\nWe expect to meet our obligations as they become due through available cash, investment securities and internally generated funds, supplemented as necessary by financing activities, as they may be available to us. We expect to generate positive working capital through our operations. However, we cannot predict what the effect on our business might be from the extremely competitive environment we are operating in or from events beyond our control, such as volatile fuel prices, economic conditions, weather-related disruptions, the spread of infectious diseases, the impact of airline bankruptcies, restructurings or consolidations, U.S. military actions or acts of terrorism. We believe there is sufficient liquidity available to us to meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nDebt and Capital Leases\nAs part of our efforts to effectively manage our balance sheet and improve return on invested capital, or ROIC, we expect to continue to actively manage our debt balances. Our approach to debt management includes managing the mix of fixed versus floating rate debt, annual maturities of debt and the weighted average cost of debt. Additionally, our unencumbered assets, including 107 aircraft and 44 engines, allow some flexibility in managing our cost of debt and capital requirements.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nOur noncancelable contractual obligations at December 31, 2018 include the following (in billions):\n\n (1) Includes actual interest and estimated interest for floating-rate debt based on December 31, 2018 rates. \n (2) Amounts include noncancelable commitments for the purchase of goods and services.  The interest rates are fixed for $1.4 billion of our debt and capital lease obligations, with the remaining $0.2 billion having floating interest rates. The floating interest rates adjust either quarterly or semi-annually based on LIBOR. The weighted average maturity of all of our debt was six years as of December 31, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we believe we were in compliance with the covenants of our debt and lease agreements and approximately 35% of our owned property and equipment were pledged as security under various loan agreements.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had operating lease obligations for 42 aircraft with lease terms that expire between 2019 and 2028. Our aircraft lease agreements contain termination provisions which include standard maintenance and return conditions. Our policy is to record these lease return conditions when they are probable and the costs can be estimated. We also lease airport terminal space and other airport facilities in each of our markets, as well as office space and other equipment. We have approximately $31 million of restricted assets pledged under standby letters of credit related to certain of our leases which will expire at the end of the related leases. As of December 31, 2018, the average age of our operating fleet was 9.8 years.\nOur firm aircraft order book as of December 31, 2018 is as follows:\n\nIn October 2018, we received notice from Airbus of anticipated delivery delays of the A321neo aircraft. The table above represents the current delivery schedule set forth in our Airbus order book as of December 31, 2018. However, due to delays, we expect a delivery of a minimum of six Airbus A321neo aircraft in 2019.\nIn July 2018, we entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) for 60 Airbus A220-300 aircraft, previously called the Bombardier CS300, for delivery beginning in 2020, and the option for 60 additional aircraft beginning in 2025. The MOU was finalized into a purchase agreement in December 2018.\nCommitted expenditures for our firm aircraft and spare engines include estimated amounts for contractual price escalations and predelivery deposits. We expect to meet our predelivery deposit requirements for our aircraft by paying cash or by using short-term borrowing facilities for deposits generally required six to 24 months prior to delivery. Any predelivery deposits paid by the issuance of notes are fully repaid at the time of delivery of the related aircraft.\nOur Terminal at JFK, T5, is governed by a lease agreement we entered into with the PANYNJ in 2005. We are responsible for making various payments under the lease. This includes ground rents for the terminal site which began at the time of the lease execution in 2005 and facility rents commenced in October 2008 upon our occupancy of T5. The facility rents are based on the number of passengers enplaned out of the terminal, subject to annual minimums. The PANYNJ reimbursed us for construction costs of this project in accordance with the terms of the lease, except for approximately $76 million in leasehold improvements provided by us. In 2013, we amended this lease to include additional ground space for our international arrivals facility, T5i, which we opened in November 2014. For financial reporting purposes, the T5 project is being accounted for as a financing obligation, with the constructed asset and related liability being reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. The T5i project was accounted for at cost. Minimum ground and facility rents at JFK totaling $272 million are included in the commitments table above as lease commitments and financing obligations.\nWe enter into individual employment agreements with each of our non-unionized FAA-licensed Crewmembers, inspectors, and air traffic controllers. Each employment agreement is for a term of five years and automatically renews for an additional five-year term unless the Crewmember is terminated for cause or the Crewmember elects not to renew it. Pursuant to these agreements, these Crewmembers can only be terminated for cause. In the event of a downturn in our business requiring a reduction in flying and related work hours, we are obligated to pay these Crewmembers a guaranteed level of income and to continue their benefits. As we are not currently obligated to pay this guaranteed income and benefits, no amounts related to these guarantees are included in the contractual obligations table above.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nNone of our operating lease obligations are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. Although some of our aircraft lease arrangements are with variable interest entities, as defined by the Consolidations topic of the Codification, none of them require consolidation in our financial statements. The decision to finance these aircraft through operating leases rather than through debt was based on an analysis of the cash flows and tax consequences of each financing alternative and a consideration of liquidity implications. We are responsible for all maintenance, insurance, and other costs associated with operating these aircraft. However, we are not obligated to provide any residual value or other guarantees to our lessors.\nWe have determined that we hold a variable interest in, but are not the primary beneficiary of, certain pass-through trusts. The beneficiaries of these pass-through trusts are the purchasers of equipment notes issued by us to finance the acquisition of aircraft. Each trust maintains a liquidity facility whereby a third party agrees to make payments sufficient to pay up to 18 months of interest on the applicable certificates if a payment default occurs.\nWe have also made certain guarantees and indemnities to other unrelated parties that are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets, which we believe will not have a significant impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. We have no other off-balance sheet arrangements. See Notes 3, 4 and 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our variable interests and other contingencies, including guarantees and indemnities.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies as well as make estimates and judgments to develop amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes. We maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the estimates that are required to prepare our financial statements. We believe our estimates and judgments are reasonable; however, actual results and the timing of recognition of such amounts could differ from those estimates. In addition, estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties that could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The policies and estimates discussed below have been reviewed with our independent registered public accounting firm and with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For a discussion of these and other significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPassenger Revenue\nTicket sales and the fees collected for related ancillary services are initially deferred in air traffic liability. Air traffic liability represents tickets sold but not yet flown, credits which can be used for future travel and a portion of the liability related to our TrueBlue\u00ae loyalty program. We allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation identified in a passenger ticket on a relative standalone basis. Passenger revenue, including certain ancillary fees directly related to passenger tickets, is recognized when the transportation is provided. Taxes that we are required to collect from our Customers, including foreign and U.S. federal transportation taxes, security taxes, and airport facility charges, are excluded from passenger revenue. Those taxes and fees are recorded as a liability upon collection and are relieved from the liability upon remittance to the applicable governmental agency.\nThe majority of the tickets sold are non-refundable. Non-refundable fares may be canceled prior to the scheduled departure date for a credit for future travel. Refundable fares may be canceled at any time prior to the scheduled departure date. Failure to cancel a refundable fare prior to departure will result in the cancellation of original ticket and an issuance of a credit for future travel. Passenger credits can be used for future travel up to a year from the date of issuance. Passenger breakage revenue from unused tickets and passenger credits will be recognized in proportion to flown revenue based on estimates of expected expiration of when the likelihood of the Customer exercising his or her remaining rights becomes remote. Breakage revenue consists of nonrefundable tickets that remain unused past the departure date, have continued validity, and are expected to ultimately expire unused, as well as passenger credits that are not expected to be redeemed prior to expiration. JetBlue used estimates based on historical experience of expired tickets and credits and considered other factors that could impact future expiration patterns of tickets and credits. Tickets which do not have continued validity past the departure date are recognized as revenue after the scheduled departure date has lapsed.\nPassenger ticket costs primarily include credit card fees, commissions paid, and global distribution systems booking fees. Costs are allocated entirely to the purchased travel services and are capitalized until recognized when travel services are provided to the Customer.\nLoyalty Program\nCustomers may earn points under our customer loyalty program, TrueBlue\u00ae, based on the fare paid and fare product purchased for a flight. Customers can also earn points through business partners such as credit card companies, hotels, car rental companies, and our participating airline partners.\nPoints Earned From a Ticket Purchase. When a TrueBlue\u00ae member travels, we recognize a portion of the fare as revenue and defer in air traffic liabilities the portion that represents the value of the points net of spoilage, or breakage. We allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone basis. We determine the standalone selling price of TrueBlue\u00ae points issued using the redemption value approach. To maximize the use of observable inputs, we utilize the actual ticket value of the tickets purchased with TrueBlue\u00ae points. The liability is relieved and passenger revenue is recognized when the points are redeemed and the free travel is provided.\nPoints Sold to TrueBlue\u00ae Partners. Our most significant contract to sell TrueBlue\u00ae points is with our co-branded credit card partner. Co-branded credit card partnerships have the following identified performance obligations: air transportation; use of the JetBlue brand name, and access to our frequent flyer customer lists; advertising; and other airline benefits. In\ndetermining the estimated selling price, JetBlue considered multiple inputs, methods and assumptions, including: discounted cash flows; estimated redemption value, net of fulfillment discount; points expected to be awarded and redeemed; estimated annual spending by cardholders; estimated annual royalty for use of JetBlue's frequent flyer customer lists; and estimated utilization of other airline benefits. Payments are typically due monthly based on the volume of miles sold during the period, and the terms of our marketing contracts are generally from one to seven years. The overall consideration received is allocated to each performance obligation based on their standalone relative selling prices. The air transportation element is deferred and recognized as passenger revenue when the points are utilized. The other elements are recognized as other revenue when the performance obligation related to those service are satisfied, which is generally the same period as when consideration is received from the participating company.\nAmounts allocated to the air transportation element which are initially deferred include a portion that are expected to be redeemed during the following twelve months (classified as a component of Air traffic liability), and a portion that are not expected to be redeemed during the following twelve months (classified as Air traffic liability - loyalty non-current). We periodically update this analysis and adjust the split between current and non-current liabilities as appropriate.\nPoints earned by TrueBlue\u00ae members never expire. TrueBlue\u00ae members can pool points between small groups of people, branded as Points Pooling\u2122. Breakage is estimate using historical redemption patterns to determine a breakage rate. Breakage rates used to estimate breakage revenue are evaluated annually. Changes to breakage estimates impact revenue recognition prospectively.\nAccounting for Long-Lived Assets\nIn accounting for long-lived assets, we make estimates about the expected useful lives, projected residual values and the potential for impairment. In estimating useful lives and residual values of our aircraft, we have relied upon actual industry experience with the same or similar aircraft types and our anticipated utilization of the aircraft. Changing market prices of new and used aircraft, government regulations and changes in our maintenance program or operations could result in changes to these estimates.\nOur long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired. Indicators include operating or cash flow losses, significant decreases in market value, or changes in technology.\nTo determine whether impairment exist for aircraft used in operations, we group assets at the fleet-type level (the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows) and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of capacity, passenger yield, fuel costs, labor costs, and other relevant factors. If an impairment occurs, the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the fleet's carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value. We estimate aircraft fair value using published sources, appraisals, and bids received from third parties, as available.\nIn 2018, we recorded an impairment charge of flight equipment and other property and equipment related to the Embraer E190 fleet transition. Refer to Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for details.\nLease Accounting\nWe operate airport facilities, office buildings, and aircraft under operating leases with minimum lease payments. We recognize the costs associated with these agreements as rent expense on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term. Within the provisions of certain leases, there are minimum escalations in payments over the base lease term. There are also periodic adjustments of lease rates, landing fees, and other charges applicable under such agreements, as well as renewal periods. The effects of the escalations and other adjustments have been reflected in rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. This includes renewal periods when it is deemed to be reasonably assured at the inception of the lease that we would incur an economic penalty for not renewing. The amortization period for leasehold improvements is the term used in calculating straight-line rent expense or their estimated economic life, whichever is shorter.\nDerivative Instruments used for Aircraft Fuel\nWe utilize financial derivative instruments to manage the risk of changing aircraft fuel prices. We do not purchase or hold any derivative instrument for trading purposes. Fair values are determined using commodity prices provided to us by independent third parties. When possible, we designate these instruments as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes, as defined by the Derivatives and Hedging topic of the Codification which permits the deferral of the effective portions of gains or losses until contract settlement.\nThe Derivatives and Hedging topic is a complex accounting standard. It requires us to develop and maintain a significant amount of documentation related to:\n(1) our fuel hedging program and fuel management approach,\n(2) statistical analysis supporting a highly correlated relationship between the underlying commodity in the derivative financial instrument and the risk being hedged, i.e. aircraft fuel, on both a historical and prospective basis, and\n(3) cash flow designation for each hedging transaction executed, to be developed concurrently with the hedging transaction.\nThis documentation requires us to estimate forward aircraft fuel prices since there is no reliable forward market for aircraft fuel. These prices are developed through the observation of similar commodity futures prices, such as crude oil and/or heating oil, and adjusted based on variations to those like commodities. Historically, our hedges have settled within 24 months; therefore, the deferred gains and losses have been recognized into earnings over a relatively short period of time.\nREGULATION G RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nWe sometimes use non-GAAP measures that are derived from the consolidated financial statements, but that are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or U.S. GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide a meaningful comparison of our results to others in the airline industry and our prior year results. Investors should consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, our financial performance measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Further, our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies. We believe certain charges included in our operating expenses on a GAAP basis make it difficult to compare our current period results to prior periods as well as future periods and guidance. The tables below show a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used in this filing to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nOperating Expenses per Available Seat Mile, excluding fuel\nOperating expenses per available seat mile, or CASM, is a common metric used in the airline industry. Our CASM for 2018 through 2014 are summarized in the table below. We exclude aircraft fuel and related taxes, operating expenses related to other non-airline businesses, such as JetBlue Technology Ventures and JetBlue Travel Products, and special items from operating expenses to determine CASM ex-fuel. During the periods presented below, special items consisted of the impairment and one-time costs related to the Embraer E190 fleet transition, as well as one-time costs related to the ratification of our pilots' collective bargaining agreement. We believe that CASM ex-fuel provides investors with the ability to measure financial performance excluding items beyond our control, such as fuel costs which are subject to many economic and political factors, or not related to the generation of an available seat mile, such as operating expense related to other non-airline businesses. We believe this non-GAAP measure is more indicative of our ability to manage airline costs and is more comparable to measures reported by other major airlines.\n\n(1) Amounts prior to 2016 do not reflect the impact of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) of the Codification, in the first quarter of 2018. Refer to Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for details.\n(2) Other non-airline expenses for 2016 includes operating expenses related to JetBlue Technology Ventures only.\nReconciliation of Operating Expense, Income before Taxes, Net Income and Earnings per Share, excluding Tax Reform Impact and Special Items\nOur GAAP results in the applicable periods include the impacts of the 2017 tax reform and charges that are deemed special items which we believe make our results difficult to compare to prior periods as well as future periods and guidance. During the periods presented below, special items consisted of the impairment and one-time costs related to the Embraer E190 fleet transition, as well as one-time costs related to the ratification of our pilots' collective bargaining agreement. We believe the impacts of the 2017 tax reform and special items distort our overall trends and that our metrics and results are enhanced with the presentation of our results excluding the impact of these items. The table below provides a reconciliation of our GAAP reported amounts to the non-GAAP amounts excluding the impact of the 2017 tax reform and special items.\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nIn 2018, we experienced the persistent competitiveness of the airline industry and the impact of the volatility in the price of jet fuel. Even with these external factors, we managed to generate operating revenue growth of almost 9.2% year-over-year. We remain committed to striving to deliver a safe and reliable JetBlue Experience for our Customers and increasing returns for our Shareholders. We believe our continued focus on cost discipline, product innovation and network enhancements, combined with our commitment to service excellence, will drive our future success.\n2018 Highlights\n\u2022We generated $7.7 billion in operating revenue, an increase of $646 million compared to 2017 due primarily to a 5.3% increase in revenue passengers and a 3.7% increase in average fare.\n\u2022Our earnings per diluted share were $0.60. Our results included pre-tax charges of $435 million related to one-time costs associated with the ratification of our pilots' collective bargaining agreement and the transition of our Embraer E190 fleet. Our earnings per share also included a fourth quarter tax benefit of $17 million. Excluding these items, our diluted earnings per share would be $1.55.\n\u2022We generated $1.2 billion in cash from operations. The significant amount of cash we generated provided the opportunity to pay cash for all 2018 aircraft deliveries, buy out two aircraft leases, invest in our infrastructure and customer experience, and execute share repurchases.\n\u2022Operating expenses per available seat mile increased 14.5% to 12.31 cents, primarily driven by an increase in aircraft fuel expense and the pre-tax charges mentioned above. Excluding fuel and related taxes, operating expenses related to our non-airline businesses, and the pre-tax charges for special items, our cost per available seat mile increased 1.1% in 2018.\nCompany Initiatives\nBalance Sheet\nWe ended 2018 with unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $887 million and undrawn lines of credit of approximately $625 million. In June 2017, Moody's Investor Service upgraded our debt rating to Ba1 from Ba3 with a stable outlook reflecting the strength of our financial position. In November 2017, Standard & Poor's Rating Services upgraded our debt rating to BB from BB- with a stable outlook. At December 31, 2018, unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was approximately 12% of trailing twelve months revenue. In 2018, we repaid $222 million of regularly scheduled debt and raised $687 million in secured aircraft debt. We had 107 unencumbered aircraft and 44 unencumbered spare engines as of December 31, 2018. During 2018, we acquired approximately 19.1 million shares of our common stock for approximately $375 million under our share repurchase program, returning excess capital to our Shareholders. Our adjusted debt to capitalization ratio was 34% at December 31, 2018.\nAircraft and Airport Infrastructure Investments\nDuring 2018, we took delivery of 10 Airbus A321 aircraft and bought out the leases on two aircraft, one of which was an Airbus A321 aircraft and the other was an Airbus A320 aircraft.\nIn 2018, we opened a new Federal Inspection Station, FIS, in Terminal A at Luis Munoz Marin International Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The FIS enables our international and domestic flights to arrive at the same terminal and thus provides a better experience to our Customers by reducing connection times.\nWe introduced self-tagging kiosks to eleven BlueCities in 2018: Las Vegas, Reagan National at Washington D.C., Fort Myers, Tampa, Seattle, Hartford, Salt Lake City, Philadelphia, Richmond, Pittsburgh, and Baltimore. Self-tagging kiosks were available at 23 of our BlueCities as of December 31, 2018. These kiosks helped streamline the airport experience for our Customers and we plan to introduce the improvements to additional BlueCities in 2019.\nNetwork\nAs part of our ongoing network initiatives and route optimization efforts, we continued to make schedule and frequency adjustments throughout 2018. As a result, we added four new destinations to our growing network and also new routes between existing BlueCities.\nOutlook for 2019\nWe believe we will improve our long-term return for Shareholders as we implement our structural cost initiatives. We plan to add new destinations and route pairings based upon market demand. We are continuously looking to expand our other ancillary revenue opportunities, improve our TrueBlue\u00ae loyalty program, and deepen our portfolio of commercial partnerships. As in the past, we intend to invest in infrastructure and product enhancements in 2019, which we believe will enable us to reap future benefits. We also plan to continue strengthening the balance sheet.\nFor the full year 2019, we estimate our operating capacity will increase by approximately 5.0% to 7.0% over 2018 with the expected delivery of six Airbus A321neo aircraft to our operating fleet. We are expecting our cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and related taxes, and operating expenses related to other non-airline businesses (CASM ex-fuel), for 2019 to increase by between approximately 0.0% to 2.0% over the level in 2018. We anticipate CASM ex-fuel growth to be higher in the first half of 2019 primarily driven by the pilots' collective bargaining agreement which became effective on August 1, 2018. We expect to see further benefits to CASM ex-fuel from the Structural Cost Program and greater impact from the Airbus A320 cabin restyle program during the second half of 2019.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n2018 Compared to 2017\nOverview\nWe reported net income of $188 million, operating income of $288 million and operating margin of 3.8% for the year ended December 31, 2018. This compares to net income of $1.1 billion, operating income of $1.0 billion, and operating margin of 14.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Diluted earnings per share were $0.60 for 2018 compared to $3.41 for the same period in 2017.\nOur 2018 and 2017 reported results included the effects of special items and the implementation of new tax reform legislation. Adjusting for these one-time items, our net income was $487 million, operating income was $723 million, and operating margin was 9.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018. This compares to adjusted net income of $574 million, operating income of $1.0 billion, and operating margin of 14.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Excluding one-time items, diluted earnings per shares was $1.55 and $1.74 for 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nOperating Revenues\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(revenues in millions; percent changes based on unrounded numbers)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year-over-Year Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Passenger revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average fare\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>175.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Yield per passenger mile (cents)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Passenger revenue per ASM (cents)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenue per ASM (cents)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average stage length (miles)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue passengers (thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue passenger miles (millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Available seat miles (ASMs) (millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Load factor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPassenger revenue accounted for 96.4% of our total operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition to seat revenue, passenger revenue includes revenue from our ancillary product offerings such as Even More\u00ae Space. Revenue generated from international routes, including Puerto Rico, accounted for 29.7% of our passenger revenues in 2018. Passenger revenue, including certain ancillary fees directly related to passenger tickets, is recognized when the transportation is provided. Passenger revenue from unused tickets and passenger credits are recognized in proportion to flown revenue based on estimates of expected expiration or when the likelihood of the Customer exercising his or her remaining rights becomes remote. We measure capacity in terms of available seat miles, which represents the number of seats available for passengers multiplied by the number of miles the seats are flown. Yield, or the average amount one passenger pays to fly one mile, is calculated by dividing Passenger revenue by Revenue passenger miles. We attempt to increase Passenger revenue primarily by increasing our yield per flight which produces higher revenue per available seat mile. Our objective is to optimize our fare mix to increase our overall average fare while continuing to provide our Customers with competitive fares.\nIn 2018, the increase in Passenger revenue was mainly attributable to a 5.3% increase in revenue passengers and a 3.7% increase in average fare. Fee revenue increased by $60 million as a result of changes in our baggage and change fee policies. Our largest ancillary product remains the Even More\u00ae Space seats, generating approximately $274 million in revenue, an increase of over 14% compared to 2017.\nOther revenue is primarily comprised of the marketing component of the sales of our TrueBlue\u00ae points. It also includes revenue from the sale of vacations packages, ground handling fees received from other airlines, and rental income.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions; per ASM data in cents; percentages based on unrounded numbers)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year-over-Year Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>per ASM\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aircraft fuel and related taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries, wages and benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Landing fees and other rents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.82\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aircraft rent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance, materials and repairs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Special items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.73\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAircraft Fuel and Related Taxes\nAircraft fuel and related taxes represented 26% of our total operating expenses in 2018 compared to 23% in 2017. The average fuel price increased 30.2% in 2018 to $2.24 per gallon. This was coupled with an increase in our fuel consumption of approximately 57 million gallons. Additional fuel consumption was mainly due to our increase in the average number of operating aircraft. Based on our expected fuel volume for 2019, a 10% per gallon increase in the cost of aircraft fuel would increase our annual fuel expense by approximately $180 million.\nIn 2018, we recognized fuel hedge losses of $2 million compared to $15 million in fuel hedge gains in 2017 and these were recorded in Aircraft fuel and related taxes. We are unable to predict the potential loss of hedge accounting, which is determined on a derivative-by-derivative basis, due to the volatility in the forward markets for these commodities.\nSalaries, Wages and Benefits\nSalaries, wages and benefits represented 28% of our total operating expenses in 2018 compared to 31% in 2017. The increase in salaries, wages and benefits was primarily driven by the incremental costs of the new pilots' collective bargaining agreement which became effective on August 1, 2018. Our Crewmember headcount also increased year-over-year. During 2018, the average number of full-time equivalent Crewmembers increased by 4% and the average tenure of our Crewmembers was 7 years. The increasing tenure of our Crewmembers, rising healthcare costs and efforts to maintain competitiveness in our overall compensation packages will continue to pressure our costs in 2019.\nOur profit sharing is calculated as 10% of adjusted pre-tax income excluding special items, and reduced by Retirement Plus contributions. Profit sharing decreased by $38 million in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily driven by higher fuel prices which negatively impacted our adjusted pre-tax income. Refer to Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nLanding Fees and Other Rents\nLanding fees and other rents include landing fees, which are at premium rates in the heavily trafficked northeast corridor of the U.S. where approximately 75% of our operations reside. Other rents primarily consist of rent for airports in our 105 BlueCities. Landing fees and other rents increased $23 million, or 5.8%, in 2018 primarily due to our increased number of departures.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization primarily include depreciation for our owned and capital leased aircraft, engines, and in-flight entertainment systems. Depreciation and amortization increased $45 million, or 9.9%, primarily driven by a 5.7% increase in the average number of aircraft operating in 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.\nMaintenance, Materials and Repairs\nMaintenance, materials and repairs are generally expensed when incurred unless covered by a long-term flight hour services contract. The average age of our aircraft in 2018 was 9.8 years which is relatively young compared to our competitors. However, as our fleet ages our maintenance costs will increase significantly, both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of our unit costs, as older aircraft require additional, more expensive repairs over time. We had an average of 13.3 additional total operating aircraft in 2018 compared to 2017.\nIn 2018, Maintenance, materials and repairs increased by $3 million, or 0.5% compared to 2017. The marginal increase was primarily driven by a change in the pricing structure of our Airbus A320 engine maintenance program which became effective in September 2017 and the timing of engine overhauls.\nOther Operating Expenses\nOther operating expenses consist of the following categories: outside services (including expenses related to fueling, ground handling, skycap, security and janitorial services), insurance, personnel expenses, professional fees, onboard supplies, shop and office supplies, bad debts, communication costs, and taxes other than payroll and fuel taxes.\nIn 2018, Other operating expenses increased by $126 million, or 13.5%, compared to 2017, primarily due to an increase in airport services and passenger onboard supplies resulting from an increased number of passengers flown and additional Mint\u00ae offerings.\nSpecial Items\nSpecial items in 2018 consist of $362 million of impairment and one-time transition costs related to our Embraer E190 fleet exit, and $73 million of one-time costs related to the ratification of our pilots' collective bargaining agreement.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate was 13.9% in 2018, compared to a benefit of 23.0% in 2017. Our 2018 and 2017 effective tax rate included a fourth quarter 2018 benefit of $17 million related to implementation of various provisions of the new tax legislation and $551 million benefit in 2017 related to the remeasurement of our deferred taxes at the time the new tax legislation was enacted. We estimate that our underlying tax rate in 2019 will be approximately 26%.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nOverview\nWe reported net income of $1.1 billion, operating income of $1.0 billion and operating margin of 14.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017. This compares to net income of $727 million, operating income of $1.3 billion and operating margin of 19.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Diluted earnings per share were $3.41 for 2017 compared to $2.13 for the same period in 2016.\nApproximately 75% of our operations are centered in and around the heavily populated northeast corridor of the U.S., which includes the New York and Boston metropolitan areas. During the third quarter of 2017, we saw unprecedented weather challenges for JetBlue and the entire airline industry, with two large hurricanes impacting our network. We estimate that, due to the severe hurricane season, revenue was negatively impacted by approximately $110 million for the full year 2017. Revenue per available seat mile (RASM) was negatively impacted by approximately 0.3 points for the full year by the hurricanes. Operating income was negatively impacted by approximately $82 million.\nOperating Revenues\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(revenues in millions; percent changes based on unrounded numbers)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year-over-Year Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Passenger revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average fare\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>166.74\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Yield per passenger mile (cents)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Passenger revenue per ASM (cents)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenue per ASM (cents)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average stage length (miles)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue passengers (thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue passenger miles (millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Available seat miles (ASMs) (millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Load factor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPassenger revenue accounted for over 96.4% of our total operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition to seat revenue, passenger revenue includes revenue from our ancillary product offerings such as Even More\u00ae Space. Revenue generated from international routes, including Puerto Rico, accounted for 28.7% of our passenger revenues in 2017. Passenger revenue, including certain ancillary fees directly related to passenger tickets, is recognized when the transportation is provided. Passenger revenue from unused tickets and passenger credits are recognized in proportion to flown revenue based on estimates of expected expiration or when the likelihood of the Customer exercising his or her remaining rights becomes remote. We measure capacity in terms of available seat miles, which represents the number of seats available for passengers multiplied by the number of miles the seats are flown. Yield, or the average amount one passenger pays to fly one mile, is calculated by dividing Passenger revenue by Revenue passenger miles. We attempt to increase Passenger revenue primarily by increasing our yield per flight which produces higher Revenue per available seat mile. Our objective is to optimize our fare mix to increase our overall average fare while continuing to provide our Customers with competitive fares.\nIn 2017, the increase in Passenger revenue was mainly attributable to a 4.6% increase in revenue passengers and a 1.3% increase in average fare. Fee revenue increased by $47 million primarily resulting from changes in our baggage fee policy. Our largest ancillary product was Even More\u00ae Space, generating approximately $241 million in revenue, an increase of 2% compared to 2016.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions; per ASM data in cents; percentages based on unrounded numbers)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year-over-Year Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>per ASM\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aircraft fuel and related taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries, wages and benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,698\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Landing fees and other rents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.67\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.73\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aircraft rent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance, materials and repairs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAircraft Fuel and Related Taxes\nAircraft fuel and related taxes represented 23% of our total operating expenses in 2017 compared to 20% in 2016. The average fuel price increased 22.0% in 2017 to $1.72 per gallon. This was coupled with an increase in our fuel consumption of approximately 32 million gallons. Additional fuel consumption was mainly due to our increase in capacity.\nIn 2017, we recognized fuel hedge gains of $15 million compared to $9 million in 2016 which were recorded in Aircraft fuel and related taxes.\nSalaries, Wages and Benefits\nSalaries, wages and benefits represented approximately 31% of our total operating expenses in 2017 compared to 32% in 2016. The increase in salaries, wages and benefits was primarily driven by an increase in our Crewmember headcount and an 8% raise for profit sharing eligible Crewmembers effective January 1, 2017 and a modified profit sharing plan.\nOur profit sharing is calculated as 10% of adjusted pre-tax income, reduced by Retirement Plus contributions. Profit sharing decreased by $133 million in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by our change in policy. During 2017, the average number of full-time equivalent Crewmembers increased by 9% and the average tenure of our Crewmembers was 6.6 years.\nRetirement Plus contributions, which equate to 5% of all of our eligible Crewmembers wages, increased by $13 million and our 3% retirement contribution for a certain portion of our FAA-licensed Crewmembers, which we refer to as Retirement Advantage, increased by approximately $3 million.\nLanding Fees and Other Rents\nLanding fees and other rents include landing fees, which are at premium rates in the heavily trafficked northeast corridor of the U.S. where approximately 75% of our operations resided. Other rents primarily consisted of rent for airports in our 101 BlueCities. Landing fees and other rents increased $40 million, or 11.1%, in 2017 primarily due to increased departures.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization primarily include depreciation for our owned and capital leased aircraft, engines, and in-flight entertainment systems. Depreciation and amortization increased $53 million, or 13.7%, primarily driven by a 6.7% increase in the average number of aircraft operating in 2017 compared to the same period in 2016.\nMaintenance, Materials and Repairs\nMaintenance, materials and repairs are generally expensed when incurred unless covered by a long-term flight hour services contract. The average age of our aircraft in 2017 was 9.2 years which was relatively young compared to our competitors. We had an average of 14.6 additional total operating aircraft in 2017 compared to 2016. In 2017, Maintenance, materials and repairs increased by $59 million, or 10.5% compared to 2016, primarily driven by increased flight hours on our engine flight-hour based maintenance agreements and by the number of airframe heavy maintenance repairs.\nOther Operating Expenses\nOther operating expenses consist of the following categories: outside services (including expenses related to fueling, ground handling, skycap, security and janitorial services), insurance, personnel expenses, professional fees, onboard supplies, shop and office supplies, bad debts, communication costs and taxes other than payroll and fuel taxes.\nIn 2017, Other operating expenses increased by $67 million, or 7.6%, compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in airport services and passenger onboard supplies resulting from an increased number of passengers flown.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate was a benefit of 23.0% in 2017, compared to our effective tax rate of 37.6% in 2016. Our effective tax rate decreased primarily due to a one-time benefit of $551 million from the remeasurement of our deferred taxes to reflect the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe airline business is capital intensive. Our ability to successfully execute our profitable growth plans is largely dependent on the continued availability of capital on attractive terms. In addition, our ability to successfully operate our business depends on maintaining sufficient liquidity. We believe we have adequate resources from a combination of cash and cash equivalents, investment securities on-hand, and two available lines of credit. Additionally, as of December 31, 2018, we had 107 unencumbered aircraft and 44 unencumbered spare engines which we believe could be an additional source of liquidity, if necessary.\nWe believe a healthy liquidity position is a crucial element of our ability to weather any part of the economic cycle while continuing to execute on our plans for profitable growth and increased returns. Our goal is to continue to be diligent with our liquidity, maintaining financial flexibility and allowing for prudent capital spending.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $474 million and short-term investments of $413 million. We believe our current level of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately 12% of trailing twelve months revenue, combined with our approximately $625 million in available lines of credit and our portfolio of unencumbered assets, provides a strong liquidity position. We believe we have taken several important steps during 2018 in solidifying our strong balance sheet and overall liquidity position. Our adjusted debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2018 was 34%.\nAnalysis of Cash Flows\nWe had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $474 million as of December 31, 2018. This compares to $303 million and $433 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We held both short and long-term investments in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Our short-term investments totaled $413 million as of December 31, 2018 compared to $390 million and $538 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our long-term investments totaled $3 million as of December 31, 2018 compared to $2 million and $90 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOperating Activities\nCash flows provided by operating activities totaled approximately $1.2 billion in 2018, compared to $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion in 2017 and 2016, respectively. There was a $179 million decrease in cash flows from operating activities in 2018 compared to 2017. Lower earnings, principally driven by an increase in aircraft fuel expenses, partially offset by higher operating revenues, contributed to this reduction. The $236 million decrease in cash flows from operations in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily a result of a 22.0% increase in the price of fuel. As of December 31, 2018, our unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as a percentage of trailing twelve months revenue was approximately 12%. We rely primarily on cash flows from operations to provide working capital for current and future operations.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring 2018, capital expenditures related to our purchase of flight equipment included $519 million for the purchase of 10 new Airbus A321 aircraft and the buyout of two aircraft leases, $206 million for flight equipment deposits, $163 million for flight equipment work-in-progress, and $130 million for spare part purchases. Other property and equipment capital expenditures included ground equipment purchases and facilities improvements for $97 million. Investing activities also included the net purchase of $28 million in investment securities.\nDuring 2017, capital expenditures related to our purchase of flight equipment included $759 million for the purchase of 16 new Airbus A321 aircraft and the buyout of three aircraft leases, $128 million for flight equipment deposits, $156 million for flight equipment work-in-progress, and $61 million for spare part purchases. Other property and equipment capital expenditures included ground equipment purchases and facilities improvements for $98 million. Investing activities also included the net purchase of $236 million in investment securities.\nDuring 2016, capital expenditures related to our purchase of flight equipment included $588 million for the purchase of 10 new Airbus A321 aircraft, and the buyout of nine aircraft leases, $161 million for flight equipment deposits, $96 million for flight equipment work-in-progress, and $18 million for spare part purchases. Other property and equipment capital expenditures included ground equipment purchases and facilities improvements for $148 million. Investing activities also included the net purchase of $23 million in investment securities.\nWe currently anticipate 2019 capital expenditures to be between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion, including approximately $1.05 billion and $1.2 billion related to aircraft and predelivery deposits. The remaining capital expenditures of approximately $150 million to $200 million relate to non-aircraft projects.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing activities during 2018 consisted of the issuance of $687 million of debt partially offset by the scheduled repayment of $222 million in debt and capital lease obligations. In addition, we acquired $382 million in treasury shares of which $375 million related to our accelerated share repurchases during 2018. During this period, we realized $48 million in proceeds from the issuance of stock related to employee share-based compensation.\nFinancing activities during 2017 consisted of the scheduled repayment of $194 million relating to debt and capital lease obligations, as a result, three aircraft became unencumbered. In addition, we acquired $390 million in treasury shares of which $380 million related to our accelerated share repurchases during 2017. During this period, we realized $48 million in proceeds from the issuance of stock related to employee share-based compensation.\nFinancing activities during 2016 consisted of the scheduled repayment of $368 million relating to debt and capital lease obligations, as a result, 17 aircraft became unencumbered. In addition, we acquired $134 million in treasury shares of which $120 million related to our accelerated share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2016. During this period, we realized $45 million in proceeds from the issuance of stock related to employee share-based compensation. During 2016, $86 million of our Series B 6.75% convertible debentures were converted by holders, as a result, we issued approximately 17.6 million shares of our common stock.\nIn November 2015, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the SEC. Under this shelf registration statement, we, or one or more selling security holders, had the capacity to offer and sell from time to time common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units, subscription rights, and pass-through certificates. Through to December 31, 2018, we had not issued any securities under this registration statement. We may utilize a replacement automatic shelf registration statement filed with the SEC, in the future to raise capital to fund the continued development of our products and services, the commercialization of our products and services or for other general corporate purposes.\nNone of our lenders or lessors are affiliated with us.\nCapital Resources\nWe have been able to generate sufficient funds from operations to meet our working capital requirements and we have historically paid cash or financed our aircraft through either secured debt or lease financing. As of December 31, 2018, we operated a fleet of 253 aircraft which included 43 Airbus A321 aircraft, 63 Airbus A320 aircraft and one Embraer E190 aircraft that were unencumbered. Of our remaining aircraft, 42 were under operating leases, six were financed under capital leases and 98 were financed by private and public secured debt. Additionally, we have 44 unencumbered spare engines. Approximately 35% of our property and equipment is pledged as security under various loan arrangements.\nDependent on market conditions, we anticipate using a mix of cash and debt financing for the expected deliveries of Airbus A321neo aircraft in 2019. To the extent we cannot secure financing on terms we deem attractive, we may be required to pay in cash, further modify our aircraft acquisition plans or incur higher than anticipated financing costs. Although we believe debt and/or lease financing should be available to us if needed, we cannot give assurance we will be able to secure financing on terms attractive to us, if at all.\nWorking Capital\nWe had a working capital deficit of $944 million as of December 31, 2018 compared to a deficit of $940 million as of December 31, 2017. Working capital deficits can be customary in the airline industry since air traffic liability is classified as a current liability.\nIn 2012, we entered into a revolving line of credit with Morgan Stanley for up to $200 million. This line of credit is secured by a portion of our investment securities held by Morgan Stanley and the borrowing amount may vary accordingly. This line of credit bears interest at a floating rate based upon the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus a margin. We did not borrow on this facility in 2018 or 2017 and the line was undrawn as of December 31, 2018.\nIn April 2017, we increased our Credit and Guaranty Agreement with Citibank, N.A. as the administrative agent to $425 million. The term of the Amended and Restated Facility runs through April 6, 2021. Borrowing under the Amended and Restated Facility bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR, plus a margin. The Amended and Restated Facility is secured by Slots at JFK, LaGuardia, Reagan National and certain other assets. The Amended and Restated Facility includes covenants that require us to maintain certain minimum balances in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, and unused commitments available under all revolving credit facilities. In addition, the covenants restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, issue preferred stock or pay dividends. During 2018 and 2017, we did not borrow on this facility and the line was undrawn as of December 31, 2018.\nWe expect to meet our obligations as they become due through available cash, investment securities and internally generated funds, supplemented as necessary by financing activities, as they may be available to us. We expect to generate positive working capital through our operations. However, we cannot predict what the effect on our business might be from the extremely competitive environment we are operating in or from events beyond our control, such as volatile fuel prices, economic conditions, weather-related disruptions, the spread of infectious diseases, the impact of airline bankruptcies, restructurings or consolidations, U.S. military actions or acts of terrorism. We believe there is sufficient liquidity available to us to meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nDebt and Capital Leases\nAs part of our efforts to effectively manage our balance sheet and improve return on invested capital, or ROIC, we expect to continue to actively manage our debt balances. Our approach to debt management includes managing the mix of fixed versus floating rate debt, annual maturities of debt and the weighted average cost of debt. Additionally, our unencumbered assets, including 107 aircraft and 44 engines, allow some flexibility in managing our cost of debt and capital requirements.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nOur noncancelable contractual obligations at December 31, 2018 include the following (in billions):\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments due in\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt and capital lease obligations(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Flight equipment obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other obligations(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Includes actual interest and estimated interest for floating-rate debt based on December 31, 2018 rates. \n (2) Amounts include noncancelable commitments for the purchase of goods and services.  The interest rates are fixed for $1.4 billion of our debt and capital lease obligations, with the remaining $0.2 billion having floating interest rates. The floating interest rates adjust either quarterly or semi-annually based on LIBOR. The weighted average maturity of all of our debt was six years as of December 31, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we believe we were in compliance with the covenants of our debt and lease agreements and approximately 35% of our owned property and equipment were pledged as security under various loan agreements.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had operating lease obligations for 42 aircraft with lease terms that expire between 2019 and 2028. Our aircraft lease agreements contain termination provisions which include standard maintenance and return conditions. Our policy is to record these lease return conditions when they are probable and the costs can be estimated. We also lease airport terminal space and other airport facilities in each of our markets, as well as office space and other equipment. We have approximately $31 million of restricted assets pledged under standby letters of credit related to certain of our leases which will expire at the end of the related leases. As of December 31, 2018, the average age of our operating fleet was 9.8 years.\nOur firm aircraft order book as of December 31, 2018 is as follows:\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Airbus A321neo\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Airbus A220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>145\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn October 2018, we received notice from Airbus of anticipated delivery delays of the A321neo aircraft. The table above represents the current delivery schedule set forth in our Airbus order book as of December 31, 2018. However, due to delays, we expect a delivery of a minimum of six Airbus A321neo aircraft in 2019.\nIn July 2018, we entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) for 60 Airbus A220-300 aircraft, previously called the Bombardier CS300, for delivery beginning in 2020, and the option for 60 additional aircraft beginning in 2025. The MOU was finalized into a purchase agreement in December 2018.\nCommitted expenditures for our firm aircraft and spare engines include estimated amounts for contractual price escalations and predelivery deposits. We expect to meet our predelivery deposit requirements for our aircraft by paying cash or by using short-term borrowing facilities for deposits generally required six to 24 months prior to delivery. Any predelivery deposits paid by the issuance of notes are fully repaid at the time of delivery of the related aircraft.\nOur Terminal at JFK, T5, is governed by a lease agreement we entered into with the PANYNJ in 2005. We are responsible for making various payments under the lease. This includes ground rents for the terminal site which began at the time of the lease execution in 2005 and facility rents commenced in October 2008 upon our occupancy of T5. The facility rents are based on the number of passengers enplaned out of the terminal, subject to annual minimums. The PANYNJ reimbursed us for construction costs of this project in accordance with the terms of the lease, except for approximately $76 million in leasehold improvements provided by us. In 2013, we amended this lease to include additional ground space for our international arrivals facility, T5i, which we opened in November 2014. For financial reporting purposes, the T5 project is being accounted for as a financing obligation, with the constructed asset and related liability being reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. The T5i project was accounted for at cost. Minimum ground and facility rents at JFK totaling $272 million are included in the commitments table above as lease commitments and financing obligations.\nWe enter into individual employment agreements with each of our non-unionized FAA-licensed Crewmembers, inspectors, and air traffic controllers. Each employment agreement is for a term of five years and automatically renews for an additional five-year term unless the Crewmember is terminated for cause or the Crewmember elects not to renew it. Pursuant to these agreements, these Crewmembers can only be terminated for cause. In the event of a downturn in our business requiring a reduction in flying and related work hours, we are obligated to pay these Crewmembers a guaranteed level of income and to continue their benefits. As we are not currently obligated to pay this guaranteed income and benefits, no amounts related to these guarantees are included in the contractual obligations table above.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nNone of our operating lease obligations are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. Although some of our aircraft lease arrangements are with variable interest entities, as defined by the Consolidations topic of the Codification, none of them require consolidation in our financial statements. The decision to finance these aircraft through operating leases rather than through debt was based on an analysis of the cash flows and tax consequences of each financing alternative and a consideration of liquidity implications. We are responsible for all maintenance, insurance, and other costs associated with operating these aircraft. However, we are not obligated to provide any residual value or other guarantees to our lessors.\nWe have determined that we hold a variable interest in, but are not the primary beneficiary of, certain pass-through trusts. The beneficiaries of these pass-through trusts are the purchasers of equipment notes issued by us to finance the acquisition of aircraft. Each trust maintains a liquidity facility whereby a third party agrees to make payments sufficient to pay up to 18 months of interest on the applicable certificates if a payment default occurs.\nWe have also made certain guarantees and indemnities to other unrelated parties that are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets, which we believe will not have a significant impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. We have no other off-balance sheet arrangements. See Notes 3, 4 and 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our variable interests and other contingencies, including guarantees and indemnities.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies as well as make estimates and judgments to develop amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes. We maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the estimates that are required to prepare our financial statements. We believe our estimates and judgments are reasonable; however, actual results and the timing of recognition of such amounts could differ from those estimates. In addition, estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties that could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The policies and estimates discussed below have been reviewed with our independent registered public accounting firm and with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For a discussion of these and other significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPassenger Revenue\nTicket sales and the fees collected for related ancillary services are initially deferred in air traffic liability. Air traffic liability represents tickets sold but not yet flown, credits which can be used for future travel and a portion of the liability related to our TrueBlue\u00ae loyalty program. We allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation identified in a passenger ticket on a relative standalone basis. Passenger revenue, including certain ancillary fees directly related to passenger tickets, is recognized when the transportation is provided. Taxes that we are required to collect from our Customers, including foreign and U.S. federal transportation taxes, security taxes, and airport facility charges, are excluded from passenger revenue. Those taxes and fees are recorded as a liability upon collection and are relieved from the liability upon remittance to the applicable governmental agency.\nThe majority of the tickets sold are non-refundable. Non-refundable fares may be canceled prior to the scheduled departure date for a credit for future travel. Refundable fares may be canceled at any time prior to the scheduled departure date. Failure to cancel a refundable fare prior to departure will result in the cancellation of original ticket and an issuance of a credit for future travel. Passenger credits can be used for future travel up to a year from the date of issuance. Passenger breakage revenue from unused tickets and passenger credits will be recognized in proportion to flown revenue based on estimates of expected expiration of when the likelihood of the Customer exercising his or her remaining rights becomes remote. Breakage revenue consists of nonrefundable tickets that remain unused past the departure date, have continued validity, and are expected to ultimately expire unused, as well as passenger credits that are not expected to be redeemed prior to expiration. JetBlue used estimates based on historical experience of expired tickets and credits and considered other factors that could impact future expiration patterns of tickets and credits. Tickets which do not have continued validity past the departure date are recognized as revenue after the scheduled departure date has lapsed.\nPassenger ticket costs primarily include credit card fees, commissions paid, and global distribution systems booking fees. Costs are allocated entirely to the purchased travel services and are capitalized until recognized when travel services are provided to the Customer.\nLoyalty Program\nCustomers may earn points under our customer loyalty program, TrueBlue\u00ae, based on the fare paid and fare product purchased for a flight. Customers can also earn points through business partners such as credit card companies, hotels, car rental companies, and our participating airline partners.\nPoints Earned From a Ticket Purchase. When a TrueBlue\u00ae member travels, we recognize a portion of the fare as revenue and defer in air traffic liabilities the portion that represents the value of the points net of spoilage, or breakage. We allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone basis. We determine the standalone selling price of TrueBlue\u00ae points issued using the redemption value approach. To maximize the use of observable inputs, we utilize the actual ticket value of the tickets purchased with TrueBlue\u00ae points. The liability is relieved and passenger revenue is recognized when the points are redeemed and the free travel is provided.\nPoints Sold to TrueBlue\u00ae Partners. Our most significant contract to sell TrueBlue\u00ae points is with our co-branded credit card partner. Co-branded credit card partnerships have the following identified performance obligations: air transportation; use of the JetBlue brand name, and access to our frequent flyer customer lists; advertising; and other airline benefits. In\ndetermining the estimated selling price, JetBlue considered multiple inputs, methods and assumptions, including: discounted cash flows; estimated redemption value, net of fulfillment discount; points expected to be awarded and redeemed; estimated annual spending by cardholders; estimated annual royalty for use of JetBlue's frequent flyer customer lists; and estimated utilization of other airline benefits. Payments are typically due monthly based on the volume of miles sold during the period, and the terms of our marketing contracts are generally from one to seven years. The overall consideration received is allocated to each performance obligation based on their standalone relative selling prices. The air transportation element is deferred and recognized as passenger revenue when the points are utilized. The other elements are recognized as other revenue when the performance obligation related to those service are satisfied, which is generally the same period as when consideration is received from the participating company.\nAmounts allocated to the air transportation element which are initially deferred include a portion that are expected to be redeemed during the following twelve months (classified as a component of Air traffic liability), and a portion that are not expected to be redeemed during the following twelve months (classified as Air traffic liability - loyalty non-current). We periodically update this analysis and adjust the split between current and non-current liabilities as appropriate.\nPoints earned by TrueBlue\u00ae members never expire. TrueBlue\u00ae members can pool points between small groups of people, branded as Points Pooling\u2122. Breakage is estimate using historical redemption patterns to determine a breakage rate. Breakage rates used to estimate breakage revenue are evaluated annually. Changes to breakage estimates impact revenue recognition prospectively.\nAccounting for Long-Lived Assets\nIn accounting for long-lived assets, we make estimates about the expected useful lives, projected residual values and the potential for impairment. In estimating useful lives and residual values of our aircraft, we have relied upon actual industry experience with the same or similar aircraft types and our anticipated utilization of the aircraft. Changing market prices of new and used aircraft, government regulations and changes in our maintenance program or operations could result in changes to these estimates.\nOur long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired. Indicators include operating or cash flow losses, significant decreases in market value, or changes in technology.\nTo determine whether impairment exist for aircraft used in operations, we group assets at the fleet-type level (the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows) and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of capacity, passenger yield, fuel costs, labor costs, and other relevant factors. If an impairment occurs, the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the fleet's carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value. We estimate aircraft fair value using published sources, appraisals, and bids received from third parties, as available.\nIn 2018, we recorded an impairment charge of flight equipment and other property and equipment related to the Embraer E190 fleet transition. Refer to Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for details.\nLease Accounting\nWe operate airport facilities, office buildings, and aircraft under operating leases with minimum lease payments. We recognize the costs associated with these agreements as rent expense on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term. Within the provisions of certain leases, there are minimum escalations in payments over the base lease term. There are also periodic adjustments of lease rates, landing fees, and other charges applicable under such agreements, as well as renewal periods. The effects of the escalations and other adjustments have been reflected in rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. This includes renewal periods when it is deemed to be reasonably assured at the inception of the lease that we would incur an economic penalty for not renewing. The amortization period for leasehold improvements is the term used in calculating straight-line rent expense or their estimated economic life, whichever is shorter.\nDerivative Instruments used for Aircraft Fuel\nWe utilize financial derivative instruments to manage the risk of changing aircraft fuel prices. We do not purchase or hold any derivative instrument for trading purposes. Fair values are determined using commodity prices provided to us by independent third parties. When possible, we designate these instruments as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes, as defined by the Derivatives and Hedging topic of the Codification which permits the deferral of the effective portions of gains or losses until contract settlement.\nThe Derivatives and Hedging topic is a complex accounting standard. It requires us to develop and maintain a significant amount of documentation related to:\n(1) our fuel hedging program and fuel management approach,\n(2) statistical analysis supporting a highly correlated relationship between the underlying commodity in the derivative financial instrument and the risk being hedged, i.e. aircraft fuel, on both a historical and prospective basis, and\n(3) cash flow designation for each hedging transaction executed, to be developed concurrently with the hedging transaction.\nThis documentation requires us to estimate forward aircraft fuel prices since there is no reliable forward market for aircraft fuel. These prices are developed through the observation of similar commodity futures prices, such as crude oil and/or heating oil, and adjusted based on variations to those like commodities. Historically, our hedges have settled within 24 months; therefore, the deferred gains and losses have been recognized into earnings over a relatively short period of time.\nREGULATION G RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nWe sometimes use non-GAAP measures that are derived from the consolidated financial statements, but that are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or U.S. GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide a meaningful comparison of our results to others in the airline industry and our prior year results. Investors should consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, our financial performance measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Further, our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies. We believe certain charges included in our operating expenses on a GAAP basis make it difficult to compare our current period results to prior periods as well as future periods and guidance. The tables below show a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used in this filing to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nOperating Expenses per Available Seat Mile, excluding fuel\nOperating expenses per available seat mile, or CASM, is a common metric used in the airline industry. Our CASM for 2018 through 2014 are summarized in the table below. We exclude aircraft fuel and related taxes, operating expenses related to other non-airline businesses, such as JetBlue Technology Ventures and JetBlue Travel Products, and special items from operating expenses to determine CASM ex-fuel. During the periods presented below, special items consisted of the impairment and one-time costs related to the Embraer E190 fleet transition, as well as one-time costs related to the ratification of our pilots' collective bargaining agreement. We believe that CASM ex-fuel provides investors with the ability to measure financial performance excluding items beyond our control, such as fuel costs which are subject to many economic and political factors, or not related to the generation of an available seat mile, such as operating expense related to other non-airline businesses. We believe this non-GAAP measure is more indicative of our ability to manage airline costs and is more comparable to measures reported by other major airlines.\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation of Operating expense per ASM, excluding fuel\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions; per ASM data in cents)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>per ASM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>per ASM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>per ASM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>per ASM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>per ASM\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.78\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aircraft fuel and related taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.74\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other non-airline expenses(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Special items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.73\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses, excluding fuel\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.82\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.53\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Amounts prior to 2016 do not reflect the impact of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) of the Codification, in the first quarter of 2018. Refer to Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for details.\n(2) Other non-airline expenses for 2016 includes operating expenses related to JetBlue Technology Ventures only.\nReconciliation of Operating Expense, Income before Taxes, Net Income and Earnings per Share, excluding Tax Reform Impact and Special Items\nOur GAAP results in the applicable periods include the impacts of the 2017 tax reform and charges that are deemed special items which we believe make our results difficult to compare to prior periods as well as future periods and guidance. During the periods presented below, special items consisted of the impairment and one-time costs related to the Embraer E190 fleet transition, as well as one-time costs related to the ratification of our pilots' collective bargaining agreement. We believe the impacts of the 2017 tax reform and special items distort our overall trends and that our metrics and results are enhanced with the presentation of our results excluding the impact of these items. The table below provides a reconciliation of our GAAP reported amounts to the non-GAAP amounts excluding the impact of the 2017 tax reform and special items.\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions except per share amounts)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Special items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses excluding special items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add back: Special items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income excluding special items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td>"}
