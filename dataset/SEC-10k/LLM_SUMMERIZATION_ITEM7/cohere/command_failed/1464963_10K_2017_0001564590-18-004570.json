We commenced principal operations on April 21, 2010. Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation, primarily through investments in privately negotiated investments in debt and equity securities of lower middle market companies.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we, together with our credit-focused affiliates, collectively had $11.6 billion of assets under management. This amount included our assets, assets of the managed funds and a separate account managed by us, and assets of the collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), separate accounts and various fund formats, including any uncalled commitments of private funds, as managed by the investment professionals of the Advisor and/or its consolidated subsidiary.\nWe are a direct lender to lower middle market companies and invest primarily in directly originated first lien senior secured loans, including unitranche investments. In certain instances, we also make second lien, subordinated, or mezzanine, debt investments, which may include an associated equity component such as warrants, preferred stock or other similar securities and direct equity investments. Our first lien senior secured loans may be structured as traditional first lien senior secured loans or as unitranche loans. Unitranche structures combine characteristics of traditional first lien senior secured as well as second lien and subordinated loans and our unitranche loans will expose us to the risks associated with second lien and subordinated loans to the extent we invest in the last-out\u201d tranche or subordinated tranche (or piece) of the unitranche loan. We may also provide advisory services to managed funds.\nWe are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company, or BDC, under the Investment Company Act of 1940 Act, as amended, or the 1940 Act. As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70% of our total assets in qualifying assets,\u201d including securities of private or thinly traded public U.S. companies, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less.\nAs a BDC, we must not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets\u201d specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include investments in eligible portfolio companies.\u201d Under the relevant U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, rules the term eligible portfolio company\u201d includes all private companies, companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, and certain public companies that have listed their securities on a national securities exchange and have a market capitalization of less than $250 million, in each case organized in the United States.\nWe are also registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.\nSince April 2010, after we completed our initial public offering and commenced principal operations, through December 31, 2017, we have been responsible for making, on behalf of ourselves, managed funds and separately managed account, over $1,979 million in aggregate commitments into 100 separate portfolio companies through a combination of both initial and follow-on investments. Since April 2010 through December 31, 2017, we, along with our managed funds and separately managed account, have received $1,296 million of gross proceeds from the realization of investments. The Company alone has received $1,067 million of gross proceeds from the realization of its investments during this same time period.\nWe have elected to be treated for tax purposes as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements. Pursuant to these elections, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level income taxes on any income we distribute to our stockholders.\nPortfolio Composition and Investment Activity\nPortfolio Composition\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $608.7 million of portfolio investments (at fair value), which represents a $60.5 million, or 9.0% decrease from the $669.2 million (at fair value) as of December 31, 2016. Our portfolio consisted of 47 investments, including THL Credit Greenway Fund LLC, or Greenway, and THL Credit Greenway Fund II LLC, or Greenway II, as of December 31, 2017, compared to 47 portfolio investments, including Greenway and Greenway II, as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, we had $158.7 million of controlled portfolio investments (at fair value) in 6 portfolio companies, which represents an $8.5 million, or 5.1% decrease from $167.2 million (at fair value) as of December 31, 2016. The decrease in controlled portfolio companies was the result of exiting one controlled investment and changes in performance of certain investments. Our average controlling equity position at December 31, 2017 was approximately $25.9 million and $26.5 million at cost and fair value, respectively. Our average controlling equity position at December 31, 2016 was approximately $26.5 million and $23.9 million at cost and fair value, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2017 and 2016, our average portfolio company investment, excluding Greenway, Greenway II, Logan JV, and portfolio investments where we only have an equity or fund investment and restructured investments where we converted debt to a controlling equity interest, at amortized cost and fair value, was approximately $14.5 million and $13.4 million and $16.0 million and $15.4 million, respectively. Including investments in funds, investments where we hold equity only positions or investments where we converted debt to a controlling equity position would not be representative of our typical portfolio investment size and were therefore excluded from the calculation. Our largest portfolio company investment as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, excluding the Logan JV and investments where we hold equity only positions or investments where we converted debt to a controlling equity position, by amortized cost and fair value was approximately $30.2 million and $30.5 million and $31.6 million and $30.5 million, respectively. Including such investments, our largest portfolio company investment as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 was our investment in the Logan JV, which totaled $67.0 million and $65.4 million and $59.0 million and $59.7 million at cost and fair value, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2017, based upon fair value, 93.1% of our debt investments bore interest based on floating rates, which may be subject to interest rate floors, such as the London Interbank offer rate, or LIBOR, and Canadian Dollar Offered Rate, or CDOR, and 6.9% bore interest at fixed rates. At December 31, 2016, 89.1% of our debt investments bore interest based on floating rates, which may be subject to interest rate floors, such as LIBOR, and 10.9% bore interest at fixed rates.\nThe following table shows the weighted average yield by investment category at their current cost.\nTable 199: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Description:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> First lien senior secured debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Second lien debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subordinated debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investments in payment rights (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CLO residual interests (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income-producing equity securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt and income-producing investments (1)(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Logan JV (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> All investments including Logan JV (1)(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Includes all loans on non-accrual status.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 201: <table> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> Yields from investments in payment rights and CLO residual interests represent an effective yield expected from anticipated cash flows.

We expect the yield to fluctuate as a result of the timing of additional capital invested, the changes in asset yields in the underlying portfolio and the overall performance of the Logan JV investment portfolio.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe weighted average yield of our debt investments is not the same as a return on investment for our stockholders but, rather, relates to a portion of our investment portfolio and is calculated before the payment of our fees and expenses. The weighted average yield was computed using the effective interest rates as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, including accretion of original issue discount and loan origination fees. This weighted average yield reflects the impact of loans on non-accrual status. There can be no assurance that the weighted average yield will remain at its current level.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, portfolio investments, in which we have debt investments, had a median earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, of approximately $11 million and $12 million, respectively, based on the latest available financial information provided by the portfolio companies for each of these periods. As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, our median attachment point in the capital structure of our debt investments in portfolio companies is approximately 4.3 times and 4.3 times the portfolio company's EBITDA, respectively, based on our latest available financial information for each of these periods.\nWe expect the percent of our portfolio investments in unsponsored investments to decrease significantly over time as we work through restructurings, which may include providing additional liquidity through revolving loans, and ultimately exit our unsponsored investments. Going forward we expect unsponsored investments we make, if any, would only be in first lien senior secured investments. As of December 31, 2017, our portfolio of unsponsored investments included seven investments. Five are performing at or above our expectations and have an Investment Score of 1 or 2. Of the two other unsponsored investments, one has an Investment Score of 3 and the other an Investment Score of 5 and is on non-accrual. As of December 31, 2016, our portfolio of unsponsored investments included seven investments. Four were performing at or above our expectations and had an Investment Score of 1 or 2. Three others had Investment Scores ranging from 3 to 5.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we have closed portfolio investments with 62 different sponsors since inception. As of December 31, 2016, we had closed portfolio investments with 56 different sponsors since inception.\nThe following table summarizes sponsored and unsponsored investments based on amortized cost

The frequency and volume of any prepayments may fluctuate significantly from period to period.\nAggregate Cash Flow Realized Gross Internal Rate of Return\nSince April 2010, after we completed our initial public offering and commenced principal operations, through December 31, 2017, our fully exited investments have resulted in an aggregate cash flow realized gross internal rate of return to us of 14.0% (based on cash invested of $945.0 million and total proceeds from these exited investments of $1,180.9 million). 85.5% of these exited investments resulted in an aggregate cash flow realized gross internal rate of return to us of 10% or greater. Internal rate of return, or IRR, is a measure of our discounted cash flows (inflows and outflows). Specifically, IRR is the discount rate at which the net present value of all cash flows is equal to zero. That is, IRR is the discount rate at which the present value of total cash invested in our investments is equal to the present value of all realized returns from the investments. Our IRR calculations are unaudited.\nCash invested, with respect to an investment, represents our aggregate cash investment in the debt or equity securities we acquire.\nRealized returns, with respect to an investment, represents the total cash received with respect to each investment, including all amortization payments, interest, dividends, prepayment fees, upfront fees, original issue discount, amendment fees and other fees and proceeds.\nGross IRR, with respect to an investment, is calculated based on the dates that we invested capital and dates we received distributions, regardless of when we made distributions to our stockholders. Initial investments are assumed to occur at time zero, and all cash flows are deemed to occur on the date in which they did occur.\nGross IRR reflects historical results relating to our past performance and is not necessarily indicative of our future results. In addition, gross IRR does not reflect the effect of management fees, expenses, incentive fees or taxes borne, or to be borne, by us or our stockholders, and would be lower if it did.\nAggregate cash flow realized gross IRR on our exited investments reflects only invested and realized cash amounts as described above, and does not reflect any unrealized gains or losses in our portfolio or non-cash restructuring transactions. Cash flows exclude sales of participations if they were anticipated at the time of the initial investment.\nInvestment Risk\nThe value of our investments will generally fluctuate with, among other things, changes in prevailing interest rates, federal tax rates, counterparty risk, general economic conditions, the condition of certain financial markets, developments or trends in any particular industry and the financial condition of the issuer. During periods of limited liquidity and higher price volatility, our ability to dispose of investments at a price and time that we deem advantageous may be impaired.\nLower-quality debt securities involve greater risk of default or price changes due to changes in the credit quality of the issuer. The value of lower-quality debt securities often fluctuates in response to company, political, or economic developments and can decline significantly over short periods of time or during periods of general or regional economic difficulty. Lower-quality debt securities can be thinly traded or have restrictions on resale, making them difficult to sell at an acceptable price. The default rate for lower-quality debt securities is likely to be higher during economic recessions or periods of high interest rates.\nTHL Credit Logan JV LLC\nOn December 3, 2014, we entered into an agreement with Perspecta Trident LLC, an affiliate of Perspecta Trust LLC, or Perspecta, to create THL Credit Logan JV LLC, or Logan JV, a joint venture, which invests primarily in senior secured first lien term loans. All Logan JV investment decisions must be unanimously approved by the Logan JV investment committee consisting of one representative from each of us and Perspecta.\nWe have determined that Logan JV is an investment company under ASC 946, however, in accordance with such guidance, we will generally not consolidate our investment in a company other than a substantially owned investment company subsidiary or a controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to us. Accordingly, we do not consolidate our non-controlling interest in Logan JV.\nLogan JV is capitalized with equity contributions which are generally called from its members, on a pro-rata basis based on their equity commitments, as transactions are completed.

As of December 31, 2016, we had investments in CLO residual interests, or subordinated notes, based upon fair market value, totaling $8.7 million. The subordinated notes are subordinated to the secured notes issued in connection with each CLO. The secured notes in each structure are collateralized by portfolios consisting primarily of broadly syndicated senior secured bank loans.\nThe subordinated notes do not have a stated rate of interest, but are entitled to receive distributions on quarterly payment dates subject to the priority of payments to secured note holders in the structures if and to the extent funds are available for such purpose. The payments on the subordinated notes and income notes are subordinated not only to the interest and principal claims of all secured notes issued, but to certain administrative expenses, taxes, and the base and subordinated fees paid to the collateral manager. Payments to the subordinated notes and income notes may vary significantly quarter to quarter for a variety of reasons and may be subject to 100% loss. Investments in subordinated notes and income notes, due to the structure of the CLO, can be significantly impacted by change in the market value of the assets, the distributions on the assets, defaults and recoveries on the assets, capital gains and losses on the assets along with prices, interest rates and other risks associated with the assets.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recognized interest income totaling $0.0 million, $2.0 million and $3.7 million respectively, related to CLO residual interests.\nInvestment in Tax Receivable Agreement Payment Rights\nIn June 2012, we invested in a TRA that entitles us to certain payment rights, or TRA Payment Rights, from Duff & Phelps Corporation, or Duff & Phelps. The TRA transfers the economic value of certain tax deductions, or tax benefits, taken by Duff & Phelps to us and entitles us to a stream of payments to be received. The TRA payment right is, in effect, a subordinated claim on the issuing company which can be valued based on the credit risk of the issuer, which includes projected future earnings, the liquidity of the underlying payment right, risk of tax law changes, the effective tax rate and any other factors which might impact the value of the payment right.\nThrough the TRA, we are entitled to receive an annual tax benefit payment based upon 85% of the savings from certain deductions along with interest. The payments that we are entitled to receive result from cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state or local income tax that Duff & Phelps realizes (i) from the tax savings derived from the goodwill and other intangibles created in connection with the Duff & Phelps initial public offering and (ii) from other income tax deductions. These tax benefit payments will continue until the relevant deductions are fully utilized, which was projected to be 16 years from the initial investment date. Pursuant to the TRA, we maintain the right to enforce Duff & Phelps payment obligations as a transferee of the TRA contract. If Duff & Phelps chooses to pre-pay and terminate the TRA, we will be entitled to the present value of the expected future TRA payments. If Duff & Phelps breaches any material obligation then all obligations are accelerated and calculated as if an early termination occurred. Failure to make a payment is a breach of a material obligation if the failure occurs for more than three months.\nThe projected annual tax benefit payment is accrued on a quarterly basis and paid annually. The payment is allocated between a reduction in the cost basis of the investment and interest income based upon an amortization schedule. Based upon the characteristics of the investment, we have chosen to categorize the investment in the TRA payment rights as an investment in payment rights.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recognized interest income totaling $2.0 million, $2.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively, related to the TRA.\nAsset Quality\nWe employ the use of board observation and information rights, regular dialogue with company management and sponsors, and detailed internally generated monitoring reports to actively monitor performance. Additionally, THL Credit has developed a monitoring template that promotes compliance with these standards and that is used as a tool to assess investment performance relative to plan.\nAs part of the monitoring process, the Advisor assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and assigns each portfolio investment a score of a 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5\nThe investment performance scores, or IPS, are as follows:\n1 - The portfolio investment is performing above our underwriting expectations.\n2 - The portfolio investment is performing as expected at the time of underwriting. All new investments are initially scored a 2.\n3 - The portfolio investment is operating below our underwriting expectations and requires closer monitoring. The company may be out of compliance with financial covenants, however, principal or interest payments are generally not past due.\n4 - The portfolio investment is performing materially below our underwriting expectations and returns on our investment are likely to be impaired. Principal or interest payments may be past due, however, full recovery of principal and interest payments are expected.\n5 - The portfolio investment is performing substantially below expectations and the risk of the investment has increased substantially. The company is in payment default and the principal and interest payments are not expected to be repaid in full.\nFor purposes of clarity, underwriting as referenced herein may be redetermined after the initial investment as a result of a transformative credit event or other material event whereby such initial underwriting is deemed by the Advisor to be no longer appropriate for the purpose of assessing investment performance relative to plan. For any investment receiving a score of a 3 or lower THL Credit Advisors will increase their level of focus and prepare regular updates for the investment committee summarizing current operating results, material impending events and recommended actions.\nThe Advisor monitors and, when appropriate, changes the investment scores assigned to each investment in our portfolio. In connection with our investment valuation process, the Advisor and board of directors review these investment scores on a quarterly basis. Our average portfolio company investment score was 2.24 and 2.36 at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The following is a distribution of the investment scores of our portfolio companies at December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in millions):\nTable 287: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,

However, we may make exceptions to this policy if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. As of December 31, 2017, we had loans on non-accrual status with an amortized cost basis of $56.3 million and fair value of $21.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, loans from two additional issuers were put on non-accrual status with one existing loan coming off non-accrual status as part of a realization of the investment. As of December 31, 2016, we had loans on non-accrual status with an amortized cost basis of $13.8 million and fair value of $6.9 million. For additional information, please refer to the Consolidated Schedules of Investments as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. Once a loan is placed on non-accrual, our Advisor takes steps to maximize recovery on our investments, including restructuring or disposition of our positions. We record the reversal of any previously accrued income against the same income category reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe decrease in Score 3\u201d from December 31, 2016 is due largely to the sale of underperforming investments and improved performance of certain investments, including certain energy-related investments. Additionally, contributing to the decrease in Score 3\u201d were two investments that were put on non-accrual status during the year and moved to Investment Scores of 4\u201d and 5\u201d.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015\nInvestment Income\nWe generate revenues primarily in the form of interest on the debt and other income-producing securities we hold. Other income-producing securities include investments in funds and an investment in payment rights. Our investments in fixed income instruments generally have an expected maturity of five to seven years, and typically bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. Interest on our debt securities is generally payable quarterly. Payments of principal of our debt investments may be amortized over the stated term of the investment, deferred for several years or due entirely at maturity. In some cases, our debt instruments and preferred stock investments may defer payments of dividends or pay interest in-kind, or PIK. Any outstanding principal amount of our debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest will generally become due at the maturity date. The level of interest income we receive is directly related to the balance of interest-bearing investments multiplied by the weighted average yield of our investments. In addition to interest income, we may receive dividends and other distributions related to our equity investments. We may also generate revenue in the form of fees from the management of Greenway and Greenway II (see Related Party Transactions\u201d), prepayment premiums, commitment, loan origination, structuring or due diligence fees, exit fees, amendment fees, portfolio company administration fees, fees for providing significant managerial assistance and consulting fees. These fees may or may not be recurring in nature as part of our normal business operations. We will disclose below what amounts, if any, are material non-recurring fees that have been recorded as income during each respective period.\nThe following shows the breakdown of investment income for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in millions):\nTable 293: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income on debt securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash interest\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 68.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> PIK interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Prepayment premiums\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net accretion of discounts and other fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total interest on debt securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 75.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dividend income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income on other income-producing securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fees related to Greenway and Greenway II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total investment income\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 78.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 84.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 94.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 294: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $0.7 million, $0.1 million and $1.3 million, respectively, of non-recurring fees from portfolio companies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in investment income from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to the contraction in overall investment portfolio since December 31, 2016, which led to lower interest income.

This decrease was partially offset by higher costs related to borrowings, including higher accelerated deferred financing costs as noted in the table above.\nThe decrease in expenses from 2015 to 2016 was due primarily to lower incentive fees as a result of realized and unrealized losses in the portfolio and lower management fees as a result of portfolio contraction. This decrease was offset by an increase in interest and fees on borrowings as a result of increased outstanding amounts of our Notes and an increased tax provision from our blocker corporation investments.\nWe expect certain of our expenses, including administrator expenses, professional fees and other general and administrative expenses to decline as a percentage of our total assets during periods of growth and increase as a percentage of our total assets during periods of asset declines. Additionally, as a result of our new incentive fee structure, expenses for incentives fees may decrease in the 2018 fiscal year.\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income was $39.7 million, or $1.21 per common share based on a weighted average of 32,797,233 common shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $44.7 million, or $1.35 per common share based on a weighted average of 33,197,100 common shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $47.6 million, or $1.41 per common share based on a weighted average of 33,636,806 common shares outstanding for the year ending December 31, 2015.\nThe decrease in net investment income from 2016 to 2017 is primarily attributable a decrease in interest on debt and other income-producing investments due to portfolio contraction and additional loans put on non-accrual status. This was partially offset by higher dividend income related to the Logan JV.\nThe decrease in net investment income from 2015 to 2016 is primarily attributable to a decrease in interest on debt investments due to portfolio contraction, additional loans put on non-accrual status or restructured and a decrease in other income related to fees earned on certain portfolio investments.

Specialty Brands Holdings, LLC and the Charming Charlie, LLC term loan were on non-accrual status with investment scores of 5\u201d and 4\u201d, respectively, as of December 31, 2017. Charming Charlie, LLC declared chapter eleven bankruptcy in 2017. These reductions were partially offset by an increase in the value of our investments in Tri-Starr Management Services, where we hold a controlling equity interest, and Holland Intermediate Acquisition Corp.\nDuring 2016, the largest reductions in value were our investments in Washington Inventory Service, Charming Charlie, LLC and Hostway Corporation. This was offset by an increase in the value of our investments in Dimont & Associates, Inc., Tri-Starr Management Services, Inc. and OEM Group LLC of approximately $23.3 million, which was a reversal of prior period unrealized depreciation to realized losses of $34.6 million (See Net Realized Gains and Losses on Investments\u201d above).\nDuring 2015, the largest reductions in value were our investments in Dimont & Associates, Inc., Tri-Starr Management Services, Inc., OEM Group LLC and Logan JV. This was offset by unrealized appreciation in C&K Market, Inc.\nProvision for Taxes on Unrealized Gains on Investments\nCertain consolidated subsidiaries of ours are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. These taxable entities are not consolidated with the Company for income tax purposes and may generate income tax liabilities or assets from temporary differences in the recognition of items for financial reporting and income tax purposes at the subsidiaries. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recognized a benefit (provision) for tax on unrealized gains on investments of $2.1 million, $0.1 million and ($1.2) million for consolidated subsidiaries, respectively. As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, $2.3 million and $4.5 million, respectively, were included in deferred tax liability on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities relating to deferred tax on unrealized gain on investments. The change in provision for tax on unrealized gains on investments relates primarily to changes to the unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of the investments held in these taxable consolidated subsidiaries, the change in U.S. federal tax rates expected in future years and the exit of our equity investments in YP Equity Investors, LLC in June 2017.\nRealized and Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) of Interest Rate Derivative\nThe interest rate derivative was entered into on May 10, 2012 and expired on May 10, 2017. Unrealized depreciation reflects the value of the interest rate derivative agreement at the end of the reporting period. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the net change of unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on interest rate derivative totaled $0.1 million, $0.2 million and $0.0 million, respectively, which is listed under net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on interest rate derivatives in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The changes were due to capital market changes impacting swap rates.\nWe measure realized gains or losses on the interest rate derivative based upon the difference between the proceeds received or the amount paid on the interest rate derivative. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we realized a loss of $0.0 million, $0.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively, as interest rate derivative periodic interest payments, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. These changes were due to capital market changes impacting swap rates.\nNet Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations\nNet increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations totaled ($7.9) million, or ($0.24) per common share based on a weighted average of 32,797,233 common shares for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $17.1 million, or $0.51 per common share based on a weighted average of 33,197,100 common shares for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $28.2 million, or $0.84 per common share based on a weighted average of 33,636,806 common shares for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe changes in net assets from operations between the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 is due primarily to the fluctuation of the realized and unrealized gains and losses in the portfolio.\nFinancial condition, liquidity and capital resources\nCash Flows from Operating and Financing Activities\nOur liquidity and capital resources are derived from our borrowings, equity raises and cash flows from operations, including investment sales and repayments, and investment income earned. Our primary use of funds from operations includes investments in portfolio companies, payment of distributions to the holders of our common stock and payments of fees and other operating expenses we incur. We have used, and expect to continue to use, our borrowings and the proceeds from the turnover in our portfolio and from public and private offerings of securities to finance our investment objectives, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act.\nWe may raise additional equity or debt capital through both registered offerings off our shelf registration statement and private offerings of securities, by securitizing a portion of our investments or borrowings from credit facilities. To the extent we determine to raise additional equity through an offering of our common stock at a price below net asset value, existing investors will experience dilution. During our 2017 Annual Stockholder Meeting held on June 6, 2017, our stockholders authorized us, with the approval of our Board of Directors, to sell up to 25% of our outstanding common stock at a price below our then current net asset value per share and to offer and issue debt with warrants or debt convertible into shares of our common stock at an exercise or conversion price that will not be less than the fair market value per share but may be below the then current net asset value per share. There can be no assurance that these capital resources will be available.\nIn December 2014, we closed a public debt offering selling $50.0 million of Notes due in 2021, or the 2021 Notes, including the exercise of the overallotment option, through a group of underwriters, less an underwriting discount, and received net proceeds of $48.5 million. In December 2015 and November 2016, we closed a public debt offering selling $35.0 million and $25.0 million, respectively, of Notes due in 2022, or the 2022 Notes, including the exercise of the overallotment option, through a group of underwriters, less an underwriting discount, and received net proceeds of $34.0 million and $24.3 million, respectively. Collectively, the 2021 Notes and 2022 Notes are referred to as the Notes.\nWe borrowed $103.4 million (includes CAD $29.4 million converted to USD $23.5 million) under our Revolving Facility for the year ended December 31, 2017 and repaid $120.3 million on our Revolving Facility from proceeds received from prepayments and sales and investment income and $75.0 million on our Term Loan Facility from proceeds from our Revolving Facility. We borrowed $140.3 million under our Revolving Facility for the year ended December 31, 2016 and repaid $31.5 million on our Term Loan Facility and $184.5 million on our Revolving Facility from prepayments and sales and investment income.\nOur operating activities provided cash of $53.4 million, $101.3 million and $58.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, primarily in connection with the purchase and sales of portfolio investments. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our financing activities included net repayments on our borrowings of $16.9 million, used $35.4 million for distributions to stockholders, $2.5 million to repurchase common stock and $1.4 million for the payment of financing and offering costs. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our financing activities used $75.8 million to repay borrowings on our facility, primarily from the net proceeds of $25.0 million from the 2022 Notes, $42.8 million for distributions to stockholders, $4.0 million to repurchase common stock and $1.1 million for payment of financing and offering costs. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our financing activities used $36.2 million to repay borrowings on our facility, primarily from the net proceeds of the $35.0 million from the 2022 Notes, $45.6 million for distributions to stockholders, $7.3 million to repurchase common stock and $3.2 million for payment of financing and offering costs.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had cash of $3.6 million and $6.4 million, respectively. We had no cash equivalents as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nWe believe cash balances, our Revolving Facility capacity and any proceeds generated from the sale or pay down of investments provides us with the liquidity necessary to acquit our pipeline in the near future.\nBorrowings\nThe following shows a summary of our Borrowings as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in millions):\nTable 309: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Borrowings Outstanding (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Weighted Average Borrowings Outstanding (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Weighted\nAverage\nInterest\nRate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Borrowings Outstanding (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Weighted Average Borrowings Outstanding (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Weighted\nAverage\nInterest\nRate\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revolving Facility (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 275.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 167.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 118.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.03\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 303.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 107.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 116.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.13\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Term Loan Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 75.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 75.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 102.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.38\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2021 Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.75\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.75\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2022 Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.75\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.75\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 385.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 277.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 228.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.11\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 488.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 292.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 306.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.55\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 310: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> As of December 31, 2017, excludes deferred financing costs of $1.2 million for the 2021 Notes and $1.8 million for the 2022 Notes presented as a reduction to the respective balances outstanding in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 311: <table> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> Represents the weighted average borrowings outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 312: <table> <tr> <td> (3)\n</td> <td> As of December 31, 2016, excludes deferred financing costs of $1.2 million for the Term Loan Facility, $1.5 million for the 2021 Notes and $2.2 million for the 2022 Notes presented as a reduction to the respective balances outstanding in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 313: <table> <tr> <td> (4)\n</td> <td> Represents the weighted average borrowings outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 314: <table> <tr> <td> (5)\n</td> <td> We may borrow amounts in U.S. dollars or certain other permitted currencies.

The Revolving Amendment revised the Revolving Facility dated August 19, 2015 to, among other things, extend the maturity date from August 2019 to December 2022 (with a one year term out period beginning in December 2021). The one year term out period is the one year anniversary between the revolver termination date, or the end of the availability period, and the maturity date. During this time, we are required to make mandatory prepayments on its loans from the proceeds we receive from the sale of assets, extraordinary receipts, returns of capital or the issuances of equity or debt. The Revolving Amendment also reduced the size of the commitments from $303.5 million to $275.0 million. The Revolving Facility, denominated in US dollars, has an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.5% (with no LIBOR floor). The Revolving Facility, denominated in Canadian dollars, has an interest rate of CDOR plus 2.5% (with no CDOR floor). The non-use fee is 1.0% annually if we use 35% or less of the Revolving Facility and 0.50% annually if we use more than 35% of the Revolving Facility. We elect the LIBOR or CDOR rates on the loans outstanding on our Revolving Facility, which can have a LIBOR or CDOR period that is one, two, three or nine months. The LIBOR rate on the US dollar borrowings outstanding on its Revolving Facility had a one month LIBOR period as of December 31, 2017. The CDOR rate on the Canadian borrowings outstanding on its Revolving Facility had a one month CDOR period as of December 31, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had United States dollar borrowings of $143.9 million outstanding under the Revolving Facility with a weighted average interest rate of 4.06% and non-United States dollar borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars of CAD $29.4 million ($23.5 million in United States dollars) outstanding under the Revolving Facility with a weighted average interest rate of 3.84%. The borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars are translated into United States dollars based on the spot rate at each balance sheet date. The impact resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates on the Revolving Facility borrowings is included in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on foreign currency borrowings in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars may be positively or negatively affected by movements in the rate of exchange between the United States dollar and the Canadian dollar. This movement is beyond our control and cannot be predicted.\nOn December 15, 2017, in conjunction with the Revolving Amendment, the $75.0 million Term Loan Facility was refinanced into the Revolving Facility and the Term Loan Facility was terminated. The Term Loan Facility previously had a maturity date of August 2021, an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.75% (with no LIBOR Floor) and had substantially similar terms to the existing Revolving Facility (as amended by the Revolving Amendment). We had elected the LIBOR rate on our Term Loan, which can have a LIBOR period that is one, two, three or nine months. As of December 31, 2016, the LIBOR rate on our Term Loan currently had a one month LIBOR period.\nEach of the Revolving Facility includes an accordion feature permitting us to expand the Revolving Facility, if certain conditions are satisfied; provided, however, that the aggregate amount of the Revolving Facility, collectively, is capped. The Second Revolving Amendment revised the cap from $600.0 million to $500.0 million.\nThe Revolving Facility generally require payment of interest on a quarterly basis for ABR loans (commonly based on the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Rate), and at the end of the applicable interest period for Eurocurrency loans bearing interest at LIBOR, the interest rate benchmark used to determine the variable rates paid on the Revolving Facility. All outstanding principal is due upon each maturity date. The Revolving Facility also requires a mandatory prepayment of interest and principal upon certain customary triggering events (including, without limitation, the disposition of assets or the issuance of certain securities).\nBorrowings under the Revolving Facility are subject to, among other things, a minimum borrowing/collateral base. The Revolving Facility have certain collateral requirements and/or covenants, including, but limited to, covenants related to: (a) limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens, (b) limitations on certain investments, (c) limitations on certain restricted payments, (d) limitations on the creation or existence of agreements that prohibit liens on certain properties of ours and our subsidiaries, and (e) compliance with certain financial maintenance standards including (i) minimum stockholders' equity, (ii) a ratio of total assets (less total liabilities not represented by senior securities) to the aggregate amount of senior\nsecurities representing indebtedness, of us and our consolidated subsidiaries, of not less than 2.00: 1.0, (iii) minimum liquidity, (iv) minimum net worth, and (v) a consolidated interest coverage ratio. In addition to the financial maintenance standards, described in the preceding sentence, borrowings under the Revolving Facility (and the incurrence of certain other permitted debt) are subject to compliance with a borrowing base that applies different advance rates to different types of assets in our portfolio.\nWe cannot be assured that we will be able to borrow funds under the Revolving Facility at any particular time or at all. We are currently in compliance with all financial covenants under the Revolving Facility.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we borrowed $103.4 million (includes CAD $29.4 million converted to USD $23.5 million) and repaid $120.3 million under the Revolving Facility. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we borrowed $140.3 million and repaid $216.0 million under the Revolving Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the carrying amount of the Company's outstanding Revolving Facility approximated fair value. The fair values of the Company's Revolving Facility are determined in accordance with ASC 820, which defines fair value in terms of the price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. The fair value of the Company's Revolving Facility is estimated based upon market interest rates and entities with similar credit risk. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Revolving Facility would be deemed to be Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nInterest expense and related fees, excluding amortization of deferred financing costs, of $8.6 million, $8.2 million and $9.0 million were incurred in connection with the Revolving Facility and Term Loan Facility during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nAmortization of deferred financing costs of $2.1 million, $1.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively, were incurred in connection with the Revolving Facility for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. As of December 31, 2017, we had $2.9 million of deferred financing costs related to the Revolving Facility, which is presented as an asset. As of December 31, 2016, we had $2.5 million of deferred financing costs related to the Revolving Facility, which is presented as an asset and $1.2 million of deferred financing costs related to the Term Loan Facility presented as a reduction to loans payable on the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities.\nIn accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain exceptions, the Company is only allowed to borrow amounts such that its asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least 200% after such borrowing. The Company's asset coverage as of December 31, 2017 was in excess of 200%.\nNotes\nIn December 2014, we completed a public offering of $50.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.75% notes due 2021, or the 2021 Notes. The 2021 Notes mature on November 15, 2021, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option on or after November 15, 2017. The 2021 Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.75% per year payable quarterly on March 30, June 30, September 30 and December 30, of each year, beginning December 30, 2014 and trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol TCRX\u201d.\nIn December 2015 and November 2016, we completed a public offering of $35.0 million and $25.0 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of 6.75% notes due 2022, or the 2022 Notes. The 2022 Notes mature on December 30, 2022, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option on or after December 30, 2018. The 2022 Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.75% per year payable quarterly on March 30, June 30, September 30 and December 30, of each year, beginning March 30, 2016 and trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol TCRZ\u201d. We refer to the 2021 Notes and the 2022 Notes collectively as the Notes.\nThe Notes are our direct unsecured obligations and rank: (i) pari passu with our other outstanding and future senior unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior to any of our future indebtedness that expressly provides it is subordinated to the Notes; (iii) effectively subordinated to all our existing and future secured indebtedness (including indebtedness that is initially unsecured to which we subsequently grant security), to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, including without limitation, borrowings under our Revolving Facility and Term Loan Facility; (iv) structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of our subsidiaries.\nThe Base Indenture, as supplemented by the First and Second Supplemental Indentures (the Indenture\u201d), contains certain covenants including covenants requiring us to comply with (regardless of whether it is subject to) the Section 18 (a)(1)(A) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act or any successor provisions, whether or not we continue to be subject to such provisions of the 1940 Act, but giving effect, in either case, to any exemptive relief granted to us by the SEC. Currently these provisions generally prohibit us from making additional borrowings, including through the issuance of additional debt or the sale of additional debt securities, unless our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% after such borrowings. These covenants are subject to important limitations and exceptions that are described in the Indenture. The Indenture provides for customary events of default and further provides that the Trustee or the holders of 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes in a series may declare such Notes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of any event of default after expiration of any applicable grace period. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with the terms of the Base Indenture and the First and Second Supplemental Indentures governing the Notes. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for more detail on the Notes.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the carrying amount and fair value of our Notes was $110.0 million and $112.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, the carrying value and fair value of our 2021 Notes was $110.0 million and $111.6 million, respectively. The fair value of our Notes is determined in accordance with ASC 820, which defines fair value in terms of the price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. The fair value of the Notes is based on the closing price of the security, which is a Level 2 input under ASC 820 due to the trading volume.\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2021 and 2022 Notes, we incurred $4.7 million of fees and expenses. Any of these deferred financing costs are presented as a reduction to the notes payable balance and are being amortized using the effective interest method over the term of the Notes. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we amortized approximately $0.7 million, $0.7 million and $0.3 million of deferred financing costs, respectively, which is reflected in amortization of deferred financing costs on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had $3.0 million and $3.7 million, respectively, of remaining deferred financing costs on the Notes, which reduced the notes payable balance on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we incurred interest expense on the Notes of approximately $7.4 million, $5.9 million and $3.4 million, respectively.\nInterest Rate Derivative\nOn May 10, 2012, we entered into a five-year interest rate swap agreement, or swap agreement, with ING Capital Markets, LLC that expired on May 10, 2017. Under the swap agreement, with a notional value of $50 million, we paid a fixed rate of 1.1425% and received a floating rate based upon the current three month LIBOR rate. We entered into the swap agreement to manage interest rate risk and not for speculative purposes.\nWe record the change in valuation of the swap agreement in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) as of each measurement period. When the quarterly swap amounts are paid or received under the swap agreement, the amounts are recorded as a realized gain (loss) as interest rate derivative periodic interest payments, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $0.0 million, $0.3 million and $0.4 million of realized loss from the swap agreement, respectively, which is reflected as interest rate derivative periodic interest payments, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $0.1 million, $0.2 million and $0.0 million of net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) from the swap agreement, respectively, which is listed under net change in unrealized depreciation on interest rate derivative in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2016, the fair value of our swap agreement was ($0.05) million, which is listed as an interest rate derivative liability on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\nCommitments and Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nFrom time to time, we, or the Advisor, may become party to legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings related to the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. Neither we, nor the Advisor, are currently subject to any material legal proceedings.\nUnfunded commitments to provide funds to portfolio companies are not reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. Our unfunded commitments may be significant from time to time. These commitments will be subject to the same underwriting and ongoing portfolio maintenance as are the on-balance sheet financial instruments that we hold. Since these commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We intend to use cash flow from normal and early principal repayments and proceeds from borrowings and offerings to fund these commitments.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we have the following unfunded commitments to portfolio companies (in millions):\nTable 315: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unfunded delayed draw facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> A10 Capital, LLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Charming Charlie, LLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unfunded revolving commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hansons Window & Construction, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> HealthDrive Corporation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Holland Intermediate Acquisition Corp.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> The John Gore Organization, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loadmaster Derrick & Equipment, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> OEM Group, LLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Togetherwork Holdings, LLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tri Starr Management Services, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sciens Building Solutions, LLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SPST Holdings, LLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Whitney, Bradley & Brown, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unfunded commitments to investments in funds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Freeport Financial SBIC Fund LP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gryphon Partners 3.5, L.P.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total unfunded commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe changes in fair value of our unfunded commitments are considered to be immaterial as the yield determined at the time of underwriting is expected to be materially consistent with the yield upon funding. We expect to fund our unfunded commitments from the same sources we use to fund our investment commitments at the time they are made (which are typically through existing cash and cash equivalents or borrowings under the Revolving Facility).\nDistributions\nWe have elected to be taxed as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. In order to maintain our status as a regulated investment company, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our investment company taxable income. To avoid a 4% excise tax on undistributed earnings, we are required to distribute each calendar year the sum of (i) 98% of our ordinary income for such calendar year (ii) 98.2% of our net capital gains for the one-year period ending October 31 of that calendar year (iii) any income recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years and on which we paid no federal income tax.\nOur quarterly distributions, if any, will be determined by our board of directors. We intend to make distributions to stockholders on a quarterly basis of substantially all of our net investment income. Although we intend to make distributions of net realized capital gains, if any, at least annually, out of assets legally available for such distributions, we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investment. In addition, the extent and timing of special dividends, if any, will be determined by our board of directors and will largely be driven by portfolio specific events and tax considerations at the time.\nIn addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the BDC asset coverage test for borrowings applicable to us as a BDC under the 1940 Act.\nThe following table summarizes our distributions declared and paid or to be paid on all shares including distributions reinvested, if any:\nTable 316: <table> <tr> <td> Date Declared\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Record

operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of our status as a regulated investment company. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions at a particular level.\nWe maintain an opt in\u201d dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, unless stockholders specifically elect to have their dividends automatically reinvested in additional shares of common stock, stockholders will receive all such dividends in cash. There was $0.0 million of dividends reinvested for the year ended December 31, 2017. There was $0.0 million of dividends reinvested for the year ended December 31, 2016. There were no dividends reinvested for the years ended December 31, 2015 under the dividend reinvestment plan.\nUnder the terms of our dividend reinvestment plan, dividends will primarily be paid in newly issued shares of common stock. However, we reserve the right to purchase shares in the open market in connection with the implementation of the plan. This feature of the plan means that, under certain circumstances, we may issue shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value per share, which could cause our stockholders to experience dilution.\nDistributions in excess of our current and accumulated profits and earnings would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder's tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. The determination of the tax attributes of our distributions will be made annually as of the end of our fiscal year based upon our taxable income for the full year and distributions paid for the full year. Therefore, a determination made on a quarterly basis may not be representative of the actual tax attributes of our distributions for a full year. Each year, a statement on Form 1099-DIV identifying the source of the distribution will be sent to our U.S. stockholders of record. Our board of directors presently intends to declare and pay quarterly distributions. Our ability to pay distributions could be affected by future business performance, liquidity, capital needs, alternative investment opportunities and loan covenants.\nThe tax character of distributions declared and paid in represented $35.4 million from ordinary income, $0 from capital gains and $0 from tax return of capital. The tax character of distributions declared and paid in 2016 represented $42.8 million from ordinary income, $0 from capital gains and $0 from tax return of capital. The tax character of distributions declared and paid in 2015 represented $45.6 million from ordinary income, $0 from capital gains and $0 from tax return of capital. Generally accepted accounting principles require adjustments to certain components of net assets to reflect permanent differences between financial and tax reporting. These adjustments have no effect on net asset value per share. Permanent differences between financial and tax reporting at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $0.9 million and $0.1 million, respectively.\nWe may generate qualified interest income and short-term capital gains that may be exempt from United States withholding tax on foreign accounts. A regulated investment company, or RIC, is permitted to designate distributions in the form of dividends that represent interest income (commonly referred to as qualified interest income) and short-term capital gains as exempt from U.S. withholding tax when paid to non-U.S. stockholders with proper documentation. As of December 31, 2017, the percentage of income estimated as qualified interest income for tax purposes was 80.4%.\nContractual obligations\nWe have entered into a contract with the Advisor to provide investment advisory services. Payments for investment advisory services under the investment management agreement in future periods will be equal to (a) an annual base management fee of 1.5% of our gross assets and (b) an incentive fee based on our performance. In addition, under our administration agreement, the Advisor will be reimbursed for administrative services incurred on our behalf.

We record the change in valuation of the swap agreement in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) as of each measurement period. When the quarterly interest rate swap amounts are paid or received under the swap agreement, the amounts are recorded as a realized gain (loss). Further discussion of the interest rate derivative is included in Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 8 Interest Rate Derivative\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d.\nStock Repurchase Program\nOn March 7, 2017 our board of directors authorized a $20.0 million stock repurchase program, which was extended on March 2, 2018. Unless extended by our board of directors, the stock repurchase program will expire on March 2, 2019 and may be modified or terminated at any time for any reason without prior notice. We have provided our stockholders with notice of our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock in accordance with 1940 Act requirements. We will retire immediately all such shares of common stock that we purchase in connection with the stock repurchase program.\nThe following table summarizes our share repurchases under our stock repurchase program for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in millions):\nTable 321: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dollar amount repurchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Shares repurchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average price per share (including commission)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9.89\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10.46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average discount to net asset value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.02\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.14\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.38\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRelated Party Transactions\nInvestment Management Agreement\nOn March 2, 2018, our investment management agreement with the Advisor was re-approved by the Board of Directors, including a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of us. Under the investment management agreement, the Advisor, subject to the overall supervision of our board of directors, manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory services to us.\nIncentive Fee on Net Investment Income\nOn November 7, 2017, we announced that we had accepted the Advisor's proposal to irrevocably waive the receipt of incentive fees related to net investment income, that it would otherwise be entitled to receive under the investment management agreement, for the period commencing on July 1, 2017 and ending on December 31, 2017. Such waived incentive fees will not be subject to recoupment.\nSubsequently, we accepted the Advisor's proposal to waive 100% of the incentive fees accrued for the period commencing on January 1, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2018 (such waiver, Incentive Fee Waiver\u201d). Such waived incentive fees shall not be subject to recoupment.\nFurther, commencing January 1, 2018, we accepted the Advisor's proposal to calculate the incentive fee on net investment income as indicated below ( Reduced Incentive Fee on Net Investment Income\u201d) and waive such portion of the Reduced Incentive Fee on Net Investment Income that is in excess of the incentive fee on net investment income as set forth in the investment management agreement that the Advisor would otherwise be entitled to receive. In order to ensure that we will pay the Advisor less aggregate fees on a cumulative basis, as calculated beginning January 1, 2018, we will, at the end of each quarter, also calculate the incentive fee on net investment income owed by us to the Advisor based on the formula in place prior to January 1, 2018 effect to the waiver ( Incentive Fee on Net Investment Income Prior to Fee Waiver Agreement\u201d). If, at any time beginning January 1, 2018, the aggregate fees on a cumulative basis, as calculated based on the formula in place after January 1, 2018, would be greater than the aggregate fees on a cumulative basis, as calculated based on the Incentive Fee on Net Investment Income Prior to Fee Waiver Agreement, the Advisor shall only be entitled to the lesser of those two amounts. See the section Incentive Fee on Net Investment Income Calculated Prior to the Fee Waiver Agreement for the details of the calculation under the investment management agreement.\nOn January 1, 2018, the Reduced Incentive Fee on Net Investment Income will be calculated by reference to the most recent trailing twelve quarter period or, if shorter, the number of quarters that have occurred since January 1, 2018 ( Trailing Twelve Quarter Period\u201d), rather than on the standalone quarterly basis as set forth in the investment management agreement. Specifically, the net investment income component will be calculated, and payable, quarterly in arrears at the end of each calendar quarter by reference to our aggregate preincentive fee net investment income, as adjusted as described below, from the calendar quarter then ending and the eleven preceding calendar quarters (or if shorter, the number of quarters that have occurred since January 1, 2018). Preincentive fee net investment income is expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any incentive fees payable during the period) at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. The hurdle amount for incentive fee based on preincentive fee net investment income will continue to be determined on a quarterly basis and equal to 2.0% (which is 8.0% annualized) but shall be multiplied by the net asset value attributable to our common stock at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters (also referred to as minimum income level\u201d). The hurdle amount will be calculated after making appropriate adjustments for subscriptions (which includes all issuances by us of shares of our common stock, including issuances pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan) and distributions that occurred during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters.\nThe calculation of preincentive fee net investment income shall continue to mean interest income, amortization of original issue discount, commitment and origination fees, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees, such as, structuring, diligence, managerial assistance and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under our administration agreement (discussed below), and any interest expense and any dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee and any offering expenses and other expenses not charged to operations but excluding certain reversals to the extent such reversals have the effect of reducing previously accrued incentive fees based on the deferral of non-cash interest. Furthermore, preincentive fee net investment income will continue to include, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash.\nThe incentive fee based on preincentive net investment income for each quarter will be determined as follows:\nTable 322: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The Investment Advisor receives no incentive fee for any calendar quarter in which our preincentive fee net investment income does not exceed the minimum income level.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 323: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Subject to the Incentive Fee Cap below, the Advisor receives 100% of our preincentive fee net investment income for the Trailing Twelve Quarters with respect to that portion of the preincentive net investment income for such quarter, if any, that exceeds the minimum income level but is less than 2.5% (which is 10.0% annualized) (also referred to as the catch-up\u201d provision); and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 324: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 20.0% of our preincentive fee net investment income, if any, greater than 2.5% (10.0% annualized) for the Trailing Twelve Quarters.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe amount of the incentive fee on preincentive net investment income that will be paid for a particular quarter will equal the excess of the incentive fee so calculated minus the aggregate incentive fees on preincentive net investment income that were paid in respect of the eleven calendar quarters (or if shorter, the number of quarters that have occurred since January 1, 2018) included in the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters but not in excess of the Incentive Fee Cap (as described below).\nThe foregoing incentive fee will be subject to an Incentive Fee Cap (as defined below). The Incentive Fee Cap\u201d for any quarter is an amount equal to (a) 20% of the Cumulative Net Return (as defined below) during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters, minus (b) the aggregate incentive fees based on income that were paid in respect of the first eleven calendar quarters (or the portion thereof) included in the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. Cumulative Net Return\u201d means (x) preincentive net investment income in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters minus (y) any Net Capital Loss, if any, in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value, we will pay no incentive fee based on income to our Advisor for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is a positive value but is less than the incentive fee based on pre-incentive net investment income that is payable to our Advisor for such quarter (before giving effect to the Incentive Fee Cap) calculated as described above, we will pay an incentive fee based on preincentive net investment income to our Advisor equal to the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is equal to or greater than the incentive fee based on preincentive net investment income that is payable to our Advisor for such quarter (before giving effect to the Incentive Fee Cap) calculated as described above, we will pay an incentive fee based on income to our Advisor equal to the incentive fee calculated as described above for such quarter without regard to the Incentive Fee Cap.\nNet Capital Loss\u201d in respect of a particular period means the difference, if positive, between (i) aggregate capital losses, whether realized or unrealized, in such period and (ii) aggregate capital gains, whether realized or unrealized, in such period.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the purpose of the Reduced Incentive Fee on Net Investment Income is to reduce aggregate incentive fees payable to Advisor by us, effective as of January 1, 2018. In order to ensure that we will pay the Advisor less aggregate fees on a cumulative basis, as calculated beginning January 1, 2018, we will, at the end of each quarter, also calculate the incentive fee on net investment income owed by us to Advisor based on the formula in place prior to January 1, 2018. If, at any time beginning January 1, 2018, the aggregate fees on a cumulative basis, as calculated based on the formula in place after January 1, 2018 after giving effect to the Incentive Fee Waiver, would be greater than the aggregate fees on a cumulative basis, as calculated based on the formula in place prior to January 1, 2018, the Advisor shall only be entitled to the lesser of those two amounts until such time as the requisite number of shareholders approve such amended incentive fee calculation\nIncentive Fee on Net Investment Income Prior to Fee Waiver Agreement\nThe incentive fee on net investment income prior to the Fee Waiver Agreement was calculated and payable, quarterly in arrears based on our preincentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter, subject to a cumulative total return requirement and to deferral of non-cash amounts. The preincentive fee net investment income, which was expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets attributable to the our common stock, for the immediately preceding calendar quarter, had a 2.0% (which is 8.0% annualized) hurdle rate (also referred to as minimum income level\u201d). The Advisor received no incentive fee for any calendar quarter in which our preincentive fee net investment income does not exceed the minimum income level. Subject to the cumulative total return requirement described below, the Advisor receives 100% of our preincentive fee net investment income for any calendar quarter with respect to that portion of the preincentive net investment income for such quarter, if any, that exceeded the minimum income level but is less than 2.5% (which is 10.0% annualized) of net assets (also referred to as the catch-up\u201d provision) and 20.0% of our preincentive fee net investment income for such calendar quarter, if any, greater than 2.5% (10.0% annualized) of net assets. The foregoing incentive fee was subject to a total return requirement, which provided that no incentive fee in respect of our preincentive fee net investment income is payable except to the extent 20.0% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations over the then current and 11 preceding calendar quarters exceeds the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the 11 preceding quarters. In other words, any ordinary income incentive fee that was payable in a calendar quarter was limited to the lesser of (i) 20% of the amount by which our preincentive fee net investment income for such calendar quarter exceeds the 2.0% hurdle, subject to the catch- up\u201d provision, and (ii) (x) 20% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the then current and 11 preceding quarters minus (y) the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the 11 preceding calendar quarters. For the foregoing purpose, the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations\u201d was the amount, if positive, of the sum of our preincentive fee net investment income, base management fees, realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation for the then current and 11 preceding calendar quarters. In addition, the portion of such incentive fee that was attributable to deferred interest (sometimes referred to as payment-in-kind interest, or PIK, or original issue discount, or OID) will be paid to Advisor, together with interest thereon from the date of deferral to the date of payment, only if and to the extent the Advisor actually received such interest in cash, and any accrual thereof was be reversed if and to the extent such interest is reversed in connection with any write-off or similar treatment of the investment giving rise to any deferred interest accrual. There was no accumulation of amounts on the hurdle rate from quarter to quarter and accordingly there is no clawback of amounts previously paid if subsequent quarters are below the quarterly hurdle rate and there is no delay of payment if prior quarters are below the quarterly hurdle rate.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 we incurred $0.0 million, $4.5 million and $11.9 million, net of incentive fees waived of $0.8 million, $0 million and $0 million, respectively, of incentive fees related to ordinary income. The lower incentive fees compared to the prior periods were the result of realized and unrealized losses in the portfolio and the current quarter incentive fee waiver. As of December 31, 2017, $0.1 million of such incentive fees related to previously deferred interest now received in cash are currently payable to the Advisor and reflected in accrued expenses and other payable in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. As of December 31, 2016, $2.2 million of such incentive fees were currently payable to the Advisor and reflected in accrued incentive fees on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, $1.0 million and $1.0 million, respectively of incentive fees incurred by us were generated from deferred interest (i.e. PIK, certain discount accretion and deferred interest) and are not payable until such amounts are received in cash. These amounts are reflected in accrued incentive fees on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\nIncentive Fee on Capital Gains\nThe second component of the incentive fee (capital gains incentive fee) is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the investment management agreement, as of the termination date). This component is equal to 20.0% of our cumulative aggregate realized capital gains from inception through the end of that calendar year, computed net of the cumulative aggregate realized capital losses and cumulative aggregate unrealized capital depreciation through the end of such year. The calculation of the\ncapital gains incentive fee has not been modified or waived. The aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees is subtracted from such capital gains incentive fee calculated. There was no capital gains incentive fee payable to our Advisor under the investment management agreement of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nGAAP Incentive Fee\nGAAP requires that the incentive fee accrual considers the cumulative aggregate realized gains and losses and unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation of investments or other financial instruments, such as an interest rate derivative, in the calculation, as an incentive fee would be payable if such realized gains and losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation were realized, even though such realized gains and losses and unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the investment management agreement ( GAAP Incentive Fee\u201d). There can be no assurance that such unrealized appreciation or depreciation will be realized in the future. Accordingly, such fee, as calculated and accrued, would not necessarily be payable under the investment management agreement, and may never be paid based upon the computation of incentive fees in subsequent periods. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 we incurred no incentive fees related to the GAAP incentive fee.\nBase Management Fee\nThe base management fee calculation remains the same and is calculated at an annual rate of 1.5% of our gross assets payable quarterly in arrears on a calendar quarter basis. For purposes of calculating the base management fee, gross assets\u201d is determined as the value of our assets without deduction for any liabilities. The base management fee is calculated based on the value of our gross assets at the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter, and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current calendar quarter.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we incurred base management fees payable to the Advisor of $10.4 million, $11.0 million and $11.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, $2.6 million and $2.6 million, respectively, was payable to the Advisor.\nAdministration Agreement\nWe have also entered into an administration agreement with the Advisor under which the Advisor will provide administrative services to us. Under the administration agreement, the Advisor performs, or oversees the performance of administrative services necessary for our operation, which include, among other things, being responsible for the financial records which we are required to maintain and preparing reports to our stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, the Advisor assists in determining and publishing our net asset value, oversees the preparation and filing of our tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our stockholders, and generally oversees the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. We will reimburse the Advisor for our allocable portion of the costs and expenses incurred by the Advisor for overhead in performance by the Advisor of its duties under the administration agreement and the investment management agreement, including facilities, office equipment and our allocable portion of cost of compensation and related expenses of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs, as well as any costs and expenses incurred by the Advisor relating to any administrative or operating services provided to us by the Advisor. Our board of directors reviews the allocation methodologies with respect to such expenses. Such costs are reflected as Administrator expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Under the administration agreement, the Advisor provides, on our behalf, managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to provide such assistance. To the extent that our Advisor outsources any of its functions, we pay the fees associated with such functions on a direct basis without profit to the Advisor.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 we incurred administrator expenses of $2.9 million, $3.6 million and $3.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, $0.0 million and $0.1 million of administrator expenses were payable to the Advisor, respectively.\nLicense Agreement\nWe and the Advisor have entered into a license agreement with THL Partners under which THL Partners has granted to us and the Advisor a non-exclusive, personal, revocable worldwide non-transferable license to use the trade name and service mark THL, which is a proprietary mark of THL Partners, for specified purposes in connection with our respective businesses. This license agreement is royalty-free, which means we are not charged a fee for our use of the trade name and service mark THL. The license agreement is terminable either in its entirety or with respect to us or the Advisor by THL Partners at any time in its sole discretion upon 60 days prior written notice, and is also terminable with respect to either us or the Advisor by THL Partners in the case of certain events of non-compliance. After the expiration of its first one year term, the entire license agreement is terminable by either us or the Advisor at our or its sole discretion upon 60 days prior written notice. Upon termination of the license agreement, we and the Advisor must cease to use the name and mark THL, including any use in our respective legal names, filings, listings and other uses that may require us to withdraw or replace our names and marks. Other than with respect to the limited rights contained in the license agreement, we and the Advisor have no right to use, or other rights in respect of, the THL name and mark. We are an entity operated independently from THL Partners, and third parties who deal with us have no recourse against THL Partners.\nManaged Funds\nThe Advisor and its affiliates may also manage other funds in the future that may have investment mandates that are similar, in whole or in part, with ours. For example, the Advisor may serve as investment adviser to one or more private funds, registered closed-end funds and CLOs. In addition, our officers may serve in similar capacities for one or more private funds, registered closed-end funds and CLOs. The Advisor and its affiliates may determine that an investment is appropriate for us and for one or more of those other funds. In such event, depending on the availability of such investment and other appropriate factors, the Advisor or its affiliates may determine that we should invest side-by-side with one or more other funds. Any such investments will be made only to the extent permitted by applicable law and interpretive positions of the SEC and its staff, and consistent with the Advisor's allocation procedures. The Advisor's policies will be designed to manage and mitigate the conflicts of interest associated with the allocation of investment opportunities if we are able to co-invest, either pursuant to SEC interpretive positions or an exemptive order, with other funds managed by the Advisor and its affiliates. As a result, the Advisor and/or its affiliates may face conflicts in allocating investment opportunities between us and such other entities. Although the Advisor and its affiliates will endeavor to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner and consistent with application allocation procedures, it is possible that we may not be given the opportunity to participate in investments made by investment funds managed by the Advisor or its affiliates.\nThe 1940 Act generally prohibits BDCs from making certain negotiated co-investments with certain affiliates absent an order from the SEC permitting the BDC to do so. The SEC has granted us the Order we sought in an exemptive application that expands our ability to co-invest in portfolio companies with Affiliated Funds in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors, subject to compliance with certain conditions to the Order. Pursuant to the Order, we are permitted to co-invest with Affiliated Funds if, among other things, a required majority\u201d (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) or our independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transactions, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies.\nGreenway\nOn January 14, 2011, THL Credit Greenway Fund LLC, or Greenway, was formed as a Delaware limited liability company. Greenway is a portfolio company of ours. Greenway is a closed-end investment fund which provides for no liquidity or redemption options and is not readily marketable. Greenway operates under a limited liability agreement dated January 19, 2011, or the Agreement. Greenway will continue in existence until January 14, 2021, subject to earlier termination pursuant to certain terms of the Agreement. The term may also be extended for up to three additional one-year periods pursuant to certain terms of the Agreement. Greenway had a two year investment period.\nGreenway had $150 million of capital committed by affiliates of a single institutional investor, and is managed by us. Our capital commitment to Greenway is $0.0 million. As of December 31, 2017, all commitments have been called. Our nominal investment in Greenway is reflected in the December 31, 2017 and 2016 Consolidated Schedules of Investments. As of December 31, 2017, distributions representing 125.4% of the committed capital of the investor have been made from Greenway. Distributions from Greenway, including return of capital and earnings, to its members from inception through December 31, 2017 totaled $188.2 million.\nWe act as the investment adviser to Greenway and are entitled to receive certain fees relating to our investment management services provided, including a base management fee, a performance fee and a portion of the closing fees on each investment transaction. As a result, Greenway is classified as an affiliate of ours. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we earned $0.0 million, $0.3 million and $0.6 million in fees related to Greenway, which is included in other income from non-controlled, affiliated investments in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, $0.1 million and $0.2 million of fees and expenses related to Greenway, respectively, were included in due from affiliate on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\nGreenway invested in securities similar to those that we invest in pursuant to investment and allocation guidelines which address, among other things, the size of the borrowers, the types of transactions and the concentration and investment ratio amongst Greenway and us. However, we have the discretion to invest in other securities.\nGreenway II\nOn January 31, 2013, THL Credit Greenway Fund II, LLC, or Greenway II LLC, was formed as a Delaware, limited liability company and is a portfolio company of ours. Greenway II LLC is a closed-end investment fund which provides for no liquidity or redemption options and is not readily marketable. Greenway II LLC operates under a limited liability agreement dated February 11, 2013, as amended, or the Greenway II LLC Agreement. Greenway II LLC will continue in existence for eight years from the final closing date, subject to earlier termination pursuant to certain terms of the Greenway II LLC Agreement. The term may also be extended for up to three additional one-year periods pursuant to certain terms of the Greenway II LLC Agreement. Greenway II LLC has a two year investment period.\nAs contemplated in the Greenway II LLC Agreement, we have established a related investment vehicle and entered into an investment management agreement with an account set up by an unaffiliated third party investor to invest alongside Greenway II LLC pursuant to similar economic terms. The account is also managed by us. References to Greenway II\u201d herein include Greenway II LLC and the account of the related investment vehicle. Greenway II has $187.0 million of commitments primarily from institutional investors. As of December 31, 2017, all commitments have been called. Our nominal investment in Greenway II is reflected in the December 31, 2017 and 2016 Consolidated Schedules of Investments. As of December 31, 2017, distributions representing 66.1% of the committed capital of the Greenway II investors have been made from Greenway II. Distributions from Greenway II to its members and investors, including return of capital and earnings, from inception through December 31, 2017 totaled $123.6 million.\nWe act as the investment adviser to Greenway II and are entitled to receive certain fees relating to our investment management services provided, including a base management fee, a performance fee and a portion of the closing fees on each investment transaction. As a result, Greenway II is classified as an affiliate of the Company. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we earned $1.1 million, $1.3 million and $1.6 million, respectively, in fees related to Greenway II, which are included in other income from non-controlled, affiliated investment in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, $0.3 million and $0.4 million of fees related to Greenway II were included in due from affiliate on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\nOther deferred assets consist of placement agent expenses incurred in connection with the offer and sale of partnership interests in Greenway II. These amounts are capitalized when commitments close and are recognized as an expense over the period when the Company expects to collect management fees from Greenway II. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $0.2 million, $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively, in expenses related to placement agent expenses, which are included in other general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, $0 million and $0.2 million, respectively, were included in other deferred assets on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. As of December 31, 2017, the other deferred assets were fully recognized.\nGreenway II invested in securities similar to those that we invest in pursuant to investment and allocation guidelines which address, among other things, the size of the borrowers, the types of transactions and the concentration and investment ratio amongst Greenway II and us. However, we have the discretion to invest in other securities.\nDue to and from Affiliates\nThe Advisor paid certain other general and administrative expenses on our behalf. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, there was $0.15 million and $0.07 million due to affiliate, which was included in accrued expenses and other payables on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Advisor owed $0.0 million of administrator expenses as a reimbursement to us, which was included in due from affiliate on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. As of December 31, 2016, we owed $0.07 million, of administrator expense to the Advisor, which was included in the accrued expenses and other payables on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\nWe act as the investment adviser to Greenway and Greenway II and are entitled to receive certain fees. As a result, each of Greenway and Greenway II is classified as an affiliate. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, $0.4 million and $0.5 million of fees related to Greenway and Greenway II, respectively, were included in due from affiliate on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\nFor our controlled equity investments, as of December 31, 2017, we had $3.5 million of dividends receivable from Logan JV and C&K Market, Inc., $0.5 million of interest and fees from OEM Group, LLC included in interest, dividends, and fees receivable, $0.2 million of interest from Copperweld Bimetallics LLC, $0.1 million of interest from Loadmaster Derrick & Equipment, Inc., and $0.3 million of interest and fees from Tri Starr Management Services, Inc. in prepaid expenses and other assets, which was offset by $0.1 million of deferred revenue in other deferred liabilities, on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. As of December 31, 2016, we had $4.5 million of dividends receivable from Logan JV and C&K Market, Inc. and $0.6 million of fees from OEM Group, LLC included in interest, dividends, and fees receivable and $0.5 million of fees from Tri Starr Management Services, Inc. in prepaid expenses and other assets, which was offset by $0.4 million of deferred revenue in other deferred liabilities, on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\nCritical accounting policies\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. In addition to the discussion below, our significant accounting policies are further described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nValuation of Portfolio Investments\nAs a BDC, we generally invest in illiquid securities including debt and equity investments of lower middle market companies. Investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued using market quotations, which are generally obtained from an independent pricing service or one or more broker-dealers or market makers. Debt and equity securities for which market quotations are not readily available or are determined to be unreliable are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors. Because we expect that there will not be a readily available market value for many of the investments in our portfolio, it is expected that many of our portfolio investments' values will be determined in good faith by our board of directors in accordance with a documented valuation policy that has been reviewed and approved by our board of directors and in accordance with GAAP. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material.\nWith respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our board of directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\nTable 325: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 326: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with senior management of the Advisor;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 327: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> to the extent determined by the audit committee of our board of directors, independent valuation firms are used to conduct independent appraisals and review the Advisor's preliminary valuations in light of their own independent assessment;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 328: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the audit committee of our board of directors reviews the preliminary valuations of the Advisor and independent valuation firms and, if necessary, responds and supplements the valuation recommendation of the independent valuation firms to reflect any comments; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 329: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of the Advisor, the respective independent valuation firms and the audit committee.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe types of factors that we may take into account in fair value pricing our investments include, as relevant, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded securities and other relevant factors. We generally utilize an income approach to value our debt investments and a combination of income and market approaches to value our equity investments. With respect to unquoted securities, the Advisor and our board of directors, in consultation with our independent third party valuation firms, values each investment considering, among other measures, discounted cash flow models, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public and other factors, which valuation is then approved by our board of directors.\nDebt Investments\nFor debt investments, we generally determine the fair value primarily using an income, or yield, approach that analyzes the discounted cash flows of interest and principal for the debt security, as set forth in the associated loan agreements, as well as the financial position and credit risk of each portfolio investments. Our estimate of the expected repayment date is generally the legal maturity date of the instrument. The yield analysis considers changes in leverage levels, credit quality, portfolio company performance and other factors. The enterprise value, a market approach, is used to determine the value of equity and debt investments that are credit impaired, close to maturity or where we also hold a controlling equity interest. The method for determining enterprise value uses a multiple analysis, whereby appropriate multiples are applied to the portfolio company's net income before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA. The collateral valuation analysis is utilized when repayment is based on the sale of the underlying collateral. This is a new technique we implemented during the quarter ended June 30, 2017.\nInterest Rate Derivative\nWe value our interest rate derivative agreement using an income approach that analyzes the discounted cash flows associated with the interest rate derivative agreement. Significant inputs to the discounted cash flows methodology include the forward interest rate yield curves in effect as of the end of the measurement period and an evaluation of the counterparty's credit risk.\nCollateralized Loan Obligations\nWe value our residual interest investments in collateralized loan obligations using an income approach that analyzes the discounted cash flows of our residual interest. The discounted cash flows model utilizes prepayment, re-investment and loss assumptions based on historical experience and projected performance, economic factors, the characteristics of the underlying cash flow, and comparable yields for similar collateralized loan obligation fund subordinated notes or equity, when available. Specifically, we use Intex cash flow models, or an appropriate substitute to form the basis for the valuation of our residual interest. The models use a set of assumptions including projected default rates, recovery rates, reinvestment rate and prepayment rates in order to arrive at estimated cash flows. The assumptions are based on available market data and projections provided by third parties as well as management estimates.\nPayment Rights\nWe value our investment in payment rights using an income approach that analyzes the discounted projected future cash flow streams assuming an appropriate discount rate, which will among other things consider other transactions in the market, the current credit environment, performance of the underlying portfolio company and the length of the remaining payment stream.\nEquity\nWe use a combination of the income and market approaches to value our equity investments. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities (including a business). The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future cash flows or earnings to a single present amount (discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. In following these approaches, the types of factors that we may take into account in fair value pricing our investments include, as relevant: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and multiples, the current investment performance rating, security covenants, call protection provisions, information rights, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, transaction comparables, our principal market as the reporting entity, and enterprise values, among other factors.\nInvestment in Funds\nIn circumstances in which net asset value per share of an investment is determinative of fair value, we estimate the fair value of an investment in an investment company using the net asset value per share of the investment (or its equivalent) without further adjustment if the net asset value per share of the investment is determined in accordance with the specialized accounting guidance for investment companies as of the reporting entity's measurement date.\nIn accordance with the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements and disclosures under GAAP, we disclose the fair value of our investments in a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The guidance establishes three levels of the fair value hierarchy as follows:\nLevel l-Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;\nLevel 2-Quoted prices in markets that are not considered to be active or financial instruments for which significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly;\nLevel 3-Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.\nThe level of an asset or liability within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. However, the determination of what constitutes observable\u201d requires significant judgment by management. For more information about our fair value measurements, see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe consider whether the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identify transactions that are not orderly in determining fair value. Accordingly, if we determine that either the volume and/or level of activity for an asset or liability has significantly decreased (from normal conditions for that asset or liability) or price quotations or observable inputs are not associated with orderly transactions, increased analysis and management judgment will be required to estimate fair value. Valuation techniques such as an income approach might be appropriate to supplement or replace a market approach in those circumstances.\nWe have adopted the authoritative guidance under GAAP for estimating the fair value of investments in investment companies that have calculated net asset value per share in accordance with the specialized accounting guidance for Investment Companies. Accordingly, in circumstances in which net asset value per share of an investment is determinative of fair value, we estimate the fair value of an investment in an investment company using the net asset value per share of the investment (or its equivalent) without further adjustment if the net asset value per share of the investment is determined in accordance with the specialized accounting guidance for investment companies as of the reporting entity's measurement date. Redemptions are not generally permitted in our investments in funds. The remaining term of our investments in funds is expected to be two to six years.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe record interest income, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. Dividend income is recognized on the ex-dividend date. Original issue discount, principally representing the estimated fair value of detachable equity or warrants obtained in conjunction with the acquisition of debt securities, and market discount or premium are capitalized and accreted or amortized into interest income over the life of the respective security using the effective yield method. The amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the accretion/amortization of discounts and premiums and upfront loan origination fees.\nLoans are placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more and/or when it is no longer probable that principal or interest will be collected. However, we may make exceptions to this policy if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. We record the reversal of any previously accrued income against the same income category reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2017, we had loans on non-accrual status with an amortized cost basis of $56.3 million and fair value of $21.0 million. As of December 31, 2016, we had loans on non-accrual status with an amortized cost basis of $13.8 million and fair value of $6.9 million.\nWe have investments in our portfolio which contain a contractual paid-in-kind, or PIK, interest provision. PIK interest is computed at the contractual rate specified in each investment agreement, is added to the principal balance of the investment, and is recorded as income. We will cease accruing PIK interest if there is insufficient value to support the accrual or if we do not expect amounts to be collectible and will generally only begin to recognize PIK income again when all principal and interest have been paid or upon a restructuring of the investment where the interest is deemed collectable. To maintain our status as a RIC, PIK interest income, which is considered investment company taxable income, must be paid out to stockholders in the form of dividends even though we have not yet collected the cash. Amounts necessary to pay these dividends may come from available cash.\nWe capitalize and amortize upfront loan origination fees received in connection with the closing of investments. The unearned income from such fees is accreted into interest income over the contractual life of the loan based on the effective interest method. Upon prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment premiums, unamortized upfront loan origination fees, and unamortized discounts are recorded as interest income.\nInterest income from our investment in TRA and CLO residual interest investments are recorded based upon an estimation of an effective yield to expected maturity using anticipated cash flows with any remaining amount recorded to the cost basis of the investment. We monitor the anticipated cash flows from our TRA and CLO residual interest investments and will adjust our effective yield periodically as needed.\nOther income includes commitment fees, fees related to the management of Greenway and Greenway II, fees related to the management of certain controlled equity investments, structuring fees, amendment fees and unused commitment fees associated with investments in portfolio companies. These fees are recognized as income when earned by us in accordance with the terms of the applicable management or credit agreement and may or may not be recurring in nature as part of our normal business operations.\nNet Realized Gains or Losses and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation\nWe measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, using the specific identification method, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized. We measure realized gains or losses on the interest rate derivative based upon the difference between the proceeds received or the amounts paid on the interest rate derivative. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values or value of the interest rate derivative during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation, when gains or losses are realized.\nU.S. Federal Income Taxes, including excise tax\nWe operate so as to maintain our status as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and intend to continue to do so. Accordingly, we are not subject to federal income tax on the portion of our taxable income and gains distributed to stockholders. In order to qualify for favorable tax treatment as a RIC, we are required to distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code. To avoid a 4% federal excise tax, we must distribute each calendar year the sum of (i) 98% of our ordinary income for each such calendar year (ii) 98.2% of our net capital gains for the one-year period ending October 31 of that calendar year, and (iii) any income recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years and on which we paid no federal income tax. We may choose not to distribute all of our taxable income for the calendar year and pay a non-\ndeductible 4% excise tax on this income. If we choose to do so, all other things being equal, this would increase expenses and reduce the amount available to be distributed to stockholders. To the extent that we determine that its estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year distributions from such taxable income, we accrue excise taxes on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned using an annual effective excise tax rate. We will accrue excise tax on undistributed taxable income as required. Please refer to Distributions\u201d above for a summary of the distributions. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we incurred U.S. federal excise tax and other tax expenses of $0.4 million, $0.4 million and $0.7 million, respectively.\nCertain consolidated subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. These taxable entities are not consolidated for income tax purposes and may generate income tax liabilities or assets from permanent and temporary differences in the recognition of items for financial reporting and income tax purposes at the subsidiaries.\nThe following shows the breakdown of current and deferred income tax provisions (benefits) for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in millions):\nTable 330: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current income tax provision:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current income tax benefit (provision)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current tax provision on realized gain on investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred income tax benefit:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred income tax benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Benefit (provision) for taxes on unrealized gain on investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese current and deferred income taxes are determined from taxable income estimates provided by portfolio companies where we hold equity or equity-like investments organized as pass-through entities in its corporate subsidiaries. These tax estimates may be subject to further change once tax information is finalized for the year. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, $0.0 million and $0.1 million, respectively, of income tax receivable was included in prepaid expenses and other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, $2.3 million and $4.5 million, respectively, were included in deferred tax liability on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities primarily relating to deferred taxes on unrealized gains and other temporary book to tax differences related to investments and other book to tax differences held in its corporate subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, $2.7 million (net of $1.1 million allowance) and $2.4 million (net of $2.1 million allowance), respectively, of deferred tax assets were presented on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities relating to net operating loss carryforwards and unrealized losses on investments and other temporary book to tax differences that are expected to be used in future periods.\nUnder the RIC Modernization Act (the RIC Act\u201d), we are permitted to carry forward capital losses incurred in taxable years beginning after December 22, 2010, for an unlimited period. However, any losses incurred during post-enactment taxable years will be required to be utilized prior to the losses incurred in pre-enactment taxable years, which carry an expiration date. As a result of this ordering rule, pre-enactment capital loss carryforwards may be more likely to expire unused. Additionally, post-enactment capital loss carryforwards will retain their character as either short-term or long-term capital losses rather than being considered all short-term as permitted under the rules applicable to pre-enactment capital losses.\nBecause U.S. federal income tax regulations differ from GAAP, distributions in accordance with tax regulations may differ from net investment income and realized gains recognized for financial reporting purposes. Differences may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified among capital accounts in the consolidated financial statements to reflect their tax character. Temporary differences arise when certain items of income, expense, gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future. Differences in classification may also result from the treatment of short-term gains as ordinary income for tax purposes.\nWe follow the provisions under the authoritative guidance on accounting for and disclosure of uncertainty in tax positions. The provisions require us to determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not threshold, the tax amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements is reduced by the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant taxing authority. There are no unrecognized tax benefits or obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Although we file U.S. federal and state tax returns, our major tax jurisdiction is U.S. federal. Our inception-to-date U.S. federal tax years remain subject to examination by taxing authorities.\nRecent Developments\nFrom January 1, 2018 through March 6, 2018, we made follow-on investments totaling $7.5 million, including a $3.2 million investment in Logan JV, at a combined weighted average yield based upon cost at the time of the investment of 9.9%.\nOn March 2, 2018, in consultation with our board of directors, we accepted the Advisor's proposal to waive 100% of the incentive fees accrued for the period commencing on January 1, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2018. Such incentive fees waived shall not be subject to recoupment. Refer to Related Party Transactions in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for more information.\nOn March 2, 2018, our board of directors declared a dividend of $0.27 per share payable on March 30, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 20, 2018.\nTable 331: <table> <tr> <td>", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I am unable to

Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words or phrases such as trend,\u201d opportunity,\u201d pipeline,\u201d believe,\u201d comfortable,\u201d expect,\u201d anticipate,\u201d current,\u201d intention,\u201d estimate,\u201d position,\u201d assume,\u201d potential,\u201d outlook,\u201d continue,\u201d remain,\u201d maintain,\u201d sustain,\u201d seek,\u201d achieve\u201d and similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as will,\u201d would,\u201d should,\u201d could,\u201d may\u201d or similar expressions.\nForward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we assume no duty to and do not undertake to update forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance.\nIn addition to factors previously identified elsewhere in this filing, the following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements or historical performance:\n \u2022 the introduction, withdrawal, success and timing of business initiatives and strategies; \n \u2022 changes in political, economic or industry conditions, the interest rate environment or financial and capital markets, which could result in changes in the value of our assets; \n \u2022 the relative and absolute investment performance and operations of our investment adviser; \n \u2022 the impact of increased competition; \n \u2022 the impact of future acquisitions and divestitures; \n \u2022 the unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings; \n \u2022 our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies; \n \u2022 the impact, extent and timing of technological changes and the adequacy of intellectual property protection; \n \u2022 the impact of legislative and regulatory actions and reforms and regulatory, supervisory or enforcement actions of government agencies relating to us or THL Credit Advisors LLC, the Advisor; \n \u2022 the ability of the Advisor to identify suitable investments for us and to monitor and administer our investments; \n \u2022 our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; \n \u2022 any future financings by us; \n \u2022 the ability of the Advisor to attract and retain highly talented professionals; \n \u2022 fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; \n \u2022 the impact of changes to tax legislation and, generally, our tax position; \n \u2022 our ability to exit a control investment in a timely manner; and \n \u2022 the ability to fund Logan JV's unfunded commitments to the extent approved by each member of the Logan JV investment committee. \nOverview\nTHL Credit, Inc., or we, us, our or the Company, was organized as a Delaware corporation on May 26, 2009 and initially funded on July 23, 2009. We commenced principal operations on April 21, 2010. Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation, primarily through investments in privately negotiated investments in debt and equity securities of lower middle market companies.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we, together with our credit-focused affiliates, collectively had $11.6 billion of assets under management. This amount included our assets, assets of the managed funds and a separate account managed by us, and assets of the collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), separate accounts and various fund formats, including any uncalled commitments of private funds, as managed by the investment professionals of the Advisor and/or its consolidated subsidiary.\nWe are a direct lender to lower middle market companies and invest primarily in directly originated first lien senior secured loans, including unitranche investments. In certain instances, we also make second lien, subordinated, or mezzanine, debt investments, which may include an associated equity component such as warrants, preferred stock or other similar securities and direct equity investments. Our first lien senior secured loans may be structured as traditional first lien senior secured loans or as unitranche loans. Unitranche structures combine characteristics of traditional first lien senior secured as well as second lien and subordinated loans and our unitranche loans will expose us to the risks associated with second lien and subordinated loans to the extent we invest in the last-out\u201d tranche or subordinated tranche (or piece) of the unitranche loan. We may also provide advisory services to managed funds.\nWe are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company, or BDC, under the Investment Company Act of 1940 Act, as amended, or the 1940 Act. As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70% of our total assets in qualifying assets,\u201d including securities of private or thinly traded public U.S. companies, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less.\nAs a BDC, we must not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets\u201d specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include investments in eligible portfolio companies.\u201d Under the relevant U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, rules the term eligible portfolio company\u201d includes all private companies, companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, and certain public companies that have listed their securities on a national securities exchange and have a market capitalization of less than $250 million, in each case organized in the United States.\nWe are also registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.\nSince April 2010, after we completed our initial public offering and commenced principal operations, through December 31, 2017, we have been responsible for making, on behalf of ourselves, managed funds and separately managed account, over $1,979 million in aggregate commitments into 100 separate portfolio companies through a combination of both initial and follow-on investments. Since April 2010 through December 31, 2017, we, along with our managed funds and separately managed account, have received $1,296 million of gross proceeds from the realization of investments. The Company alone has received $1,067 million of gross proceeds from the realization of its investments during this same time period.\nWe have elected to be treated for tax purposes as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements. Pursuant to these elections, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level income taxes on any income we distribute to our stockholders.\nPortfolio Composition and Investment Activity\nPortfolio Composition\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $608.7 million of portfolio investments (at fair value), which represents a $60.5 million, or 9.0% decrease from the $669.2 million (at fair value) as of December 31, 2016. Our portfolio consisted of 47 investments, including THL Credit Greenway Fund LLC, or Greenway, and THL Credit Greenway Fund II LLC, or Greenway II, as of December 31, 2017, compared to 47 portfolio investments, including Greenway and Greenway II, as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, we had $158.7 million of controlled portfolio investments (at fair value) in 6 portfolio companies, which represents an $8.5 million, or 5.1% decrease from $167.2 million (at fair value) as of December 31, 2016. The decrease in controlled portfolio companies was the result of exiting one controlled investment and changes in performance of certain investments. Our average controlling equity position at December 31, 2017 was approximately $25.9 million and $26.5 million at cost and fair value, respectively. Our average controlling equity position at December 31, 2016 was approximately $26.5 million and $23.9 million at cost and fair value, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2017 and 2016, our average portfolio company investment, excluding Greenway, Greenway II, Logan JV, and portfolio investments where we only have an equity or fund investment and restructured investments where we converted debt to a controlling equity interest, at amortized cost and fair value, was approximately $14.5 million and $13.4 million and $16.0 million and $15.4 million, respectively. Including investments in funds, investments where we hold equity only positions or investments where we converted debt to a controlling equity position would not be representative of our typical portfolio investment size and were therefore excluded from the calculation. Our largest portfolio company investment as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, excluding the Logan JV and investments where we hold equity only positions or investments where we converted debt to a controlling equity position, by amortized cost and fair value was approximately $30.2 million and $30.5 million and $31.6 million and $30.5 million, respectively. Including such investments, our largest portfolio company investment as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 was our investment in the Logan JV, which totaled $67.0 million and $65.4 million and $59.0 million and $59.7 million at cost and fair value, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2017, based upon fair value, 93.1% of our debt investments bore interest based on floating rates, which may be subject to interest rate floors, such as the London Interbank offer rate, or LIBOR, and Canadian Dollar Offered Rate, or CDOR, and 6.9% bore interest at fixed rates. At December 31, 2016, 89.1% of our debt investments bore interest based on floating rates, which may be subject to interest rate floors, such as LIBOR, and 10.9% bore interest at fixed rates.\nThe following table shows the weighted average yield by investment category at their current cost.\n\n (1) Includes all loans on non-accrual status. \n (2) Yields from investments in payment rights and CLO residual interests represent an effective yield expected from anticipated cash flows. Our two remaining investments in CLO residual interests as of December 31, 2016 were sold in January 2017. \n (3) Includes yields on controlled investments, but excludes the yield on the Logan JV. \n (4) As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the distributions declared and earned of $9.3 million and $7.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, represented a yield to us of 14.2% and 14.1%, respectively, based on average capital invested. We expect the yield to fluctuate as a result of the timing of additional capital invested, the changes in asset yields in the underlying portfolio and the overall performance of the Logan JV investment portfolio. \nThe weighted average yield of our debt investments is not the same as a return on investment for our stockholders but, rather, relates to a portion of our investment portfolio and is calculated before the payment of our fees and expenses. The weighted average yield was computed using the effective interest rates as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, including accretion of original issue discount and loan origination fees. This weighted average yield reflects the impact of loans on non-accrual status. There can be no assurance that the weighted average yield will remain at its current level.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, portfolio investments, in which we have debt investments, had a median earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, of approximately $11 million and $12 million, respectively, based on the latest available financial information provided by the portfolio companies for each of these periods. As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, our median attachment point in the capital structure of our debt investments in portfolio companies is approximately 4.3 times and 4.3 times the portfolio company's EBITDA, respectively, based on our latest available financial information for each of these periods.\nWe expect the percent of our portfolio investments in unsponsored investments to decrease significantly over time as we work through restructurings, which may include providing additional liquidity through revolving loans, and ultimately exit our unsponsored investments. Going forward we expect unsponsored investments we make, if any, would only be in first lien senior secured investments. As of December 31, 2017, our portfolio of unsponsored investments included seven investments. Five are performing at or above our expectations and have an Investment Score of 1 or 2. Of the two other unsponsored investments, one has an Investment Score of 3 and the other an Investment Score of 5 and is on non-accrual. As of December 31, 2016, our portfolio of unsponsored investments included seven investments. Four were performing at or above our expectations and had an Investment Score of 1 or 2. Three others had Investment Scores ranging from 3 to 5.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we have closed portfolio investments with 62 different sponsors since inception. As of December 31, 2016, we had closed portfolio investments with 56 different sponsors since inception.\nThe following table summarizes sponsored and unsponsored investments based on amortized cost and fair value (in millions).\n\n (1) Excludes THL Credit Greenway Fund I LLC, THL Credit Greenway Fund II LLC, and THL Credit Logan JV LLC. \nThe following table summarizes the amortized cost and fair value of investments as of December 31, 2017 (in millions).\n\n (1) All investments are categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, except for investments in funds and the Logan JV, which are excluded from the fair value hierarchy in accordance with ASU 2015-07. These assets are valued at net asset value. \n (2) Includes our holdings in C&K Market, Inc., which declared quarterly dividends of $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This investment has paid a quarterly dividend since the quarter ended December 31, 2015. \nThe following table summarizes the amortized cost and fair value of investments as of December 31, 2016 (in millions).\n\n (1) All investments are categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, except for investments in funds and the Logan JV, which are excluded from the fair value hierarchy in accordance with ASU 2015-07. These assets are valued at net asset value. \n (2) Includes our holdings in C&K Market, Inc., which declared quarterly dividends of $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This investment has paid a quarterly dividend since the quarter ended December 31, 2015. \nWe expect the percent of our core assets, which we define as first lien senior secured loans and the Logan JV, to continue to increase as a percent of total investments as we exit non-qualifying BDC assets as defined under the 1940 Act and our controlled equity investments, through sales or repayments, and redeploy these proceeds. We intend to continue our efforts to reposition the portfolio towards these core assets, which we believe will reduce our exposure to portfolio company risks and potential changes in interest rates.\nThe following is a summary of the industry classification in which the Company invests as of December 31, 2017 (in millions).\n\nThe following is a summary of the industry classification in which the Company invests as of December 31, 2016 (in millions).\n\nAs required by the 1940 Act, we classify our investments by level of control. Control investments\u201d are defined in the 1940 Act as investments in those companies that we are deemed to control\u201d, which, in general, includes a company in which we own 25% or more of the voting securities of such company or have greater than 50% representation on its board. Affiliate investments\u201d are investments in those companies that are affiliated companies\u201d of ours, as defined in the 1940 Act, which are not control investments. We are deemed to be an affiliate\u201d of a company in which we have invested if we own 5% or more, but less than 25%, of the voting securities of such company. Non-control/non-affiliate investments\u201d are investments that are neither control investments nor affiliate investments.\nThe following table summarizes our realized gains (losses) and changes in our unrealized appreciation and depreciation on control and affiliate investments for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 (in millions):\n\n (1) The principal amount and ownership detail is shown in the Consolidated Schedule of Investments as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.

As part of the restructuring, we exchanged the cost basis of our secured term loan totaling $19.3 million, for a debt-like preferred equity position of $3.4 million and a controlled equity position of an affiliate of Copperweld valued at $9.0 million, with $5.4 million remaining as a secured term loan. \n (4) In December 2016, we exercised our warrants in connection with an acquisition of common stock from the sponsor and company management to take a controlling interest in Loadmaster Derrick Equipment, Inc. \n (5) On March 17, 2016, as part of a restructuring of OEM Group, the cost basis of our first lien senior loans totaling $33.2 million was converted to a new first lien senior secured term loan of $18.7 million and controlled equity interest, valued at $8.3 million. \n (6) Together with Perspecta Trident LLC, or Perspecta, an affiliate of Perspecta Trust LLC, we invest in THL Credit Logan JV LLC, of Logan JV. Logan JV is capitalized through equity contributions from its members and investment decisions must be unanimously approved by the Logan JV investment committee consisting of one representative from each Perspecta and us. \n (7) On July 22, 2016, as part of the restructuring, we exchanged the cost basis of its subordinated debt totaling $20.6 million for a controlled equity position of an affiliate of Tri-Starr Management Services, Inc. valued at $3.1 million. \n (8) Income includes certain fees relating to investment management services provided by the Company, including a base management fee, a performance fee and a portion of the closing fees on each investment transaction. \n\n (1) The principal amount and ownership detail is shown in the Consolidated Schedule of Investments as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.

As part of the restructuring, we exchanged the cost basis of our equity interest totaling $6.6 million and a subordinated term loan totaling $4.5 million for an equity interest in an affiliated entity valued at $0.1 million. As part of this transaction, Dimont was no longer a controlled investment. \n (5) In December 2016, we exercised our warrants in connection with an acquisition of common stock from the sponsor and company management to take a controlling interest in Loadmaster Derrick Equipment, Inc. \n (6) On March 17, 2016, as part of a restructuring of OEM Group, the cost basis of our first lien senior loans totaling $33.2 million was converted to a new first lien senior secured term loan of $18.7 million and controlled equity interest, valued at $8.3 million. \n (7) Together with Perspecta Trident LLC, or Perspecta, an affiliate of Perspecta Trust LLC, we invest in THL Credit Logan JV LLC, of Logan JV.

The frequency and volume of any prepayments may fluctuate significantly from period to period.\nAggregate Cash Flow Realized Gross Internal Rate of Return\nSince April 2010, after we completed our initial public offering and commenced principal operations, through December 31, 2017, our fully exited investments have resulted in an aggregate cash flow realized gross internal rate of return to us of 14.0% (based on cash invested of $945.0 million and total proceeds from these exited investments of $1,180.9 million). 85.5% of these exited investments resulted in an aggregate cash flow realized gross internal rate of return to us of 10% or greater. Internal rate of return, or IRR, is a measure of our discounted cash flows (inflows and outflows). Specifically, IRR is the discount rate at which the net present value of all cash flows is equal to zero. That is, IRR is the discount rate at which the present value of total cash invested in our investments is equal to the present value of all realized returns from the investments. Our IRR calculations are unaudited.\nCash invested, with respect to an investment, represents our aggregate cash investment in the debt or equity securities we acquire.\nRealized returns, with respect to an investment, represents the total cash received with respect to each investment, including all amortization payments, interest, dividends, prepayment fees, upfront fees, original issue discount, amendment fees and other fees and proceeds.\nGross IRR, with respect to an investment, is calculated based on", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis report, and other statements that we may make, may contain forward-looking statements with respect to future financial or business performance, strategies or expectations. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words or phrases such as trend,\u201d opportunity,\u201d pipeline,\u201d believe,\u201d comfortable,\u201d expect,\u201d anticipate,\u201d current,\u201d intention,\u201d estimate,\u201d position,\u201d assume,\u201d potential,\u201d outlook,\u201d continue,\u201d remain,\u201d maintain,\u201d sustain,\u201d seek,\u201d achieve\u201d and similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as will,\u201d would,\u201d should,\u201d could,\u201d may\u201d or similar expressions.\nForward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we assume no duty to and do not undertake to update forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance.\nIn addition to factors previously identified elsewhere in this filing, the following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements or historical performance:\n \u2022 the introduction, withdrawal, success and timing of business initiatives and strategies; \n \u2022 changes in political, economic or industry conditions, the interest rate environment or financial and capital markets, which could result in changes in the value of our assets; \n \u2022 the relative and absolute investment performance and operations of our investment adviser; \n \u2022 the impact of increased competition; \n \u2022 the impact of future acquisitions and divestitures; \n \u2022 the unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings; \n \u2022 our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies; \n \u2022 the impact, extent and timing of technological changes and the adequacy of intellectual property protection; \n \u2022 the impact of legislative and regulatory actions and reforms and regulatory, supervisory or enforcement actions of government agencies relating to us or THL Credit Advisors LLC, the Advisor; \n \u2022 the ability of the Advisor to identify suitable investments for us and to monitor and administer our investments; \n \u2022 our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; \n \u2022 any future financings by us; \n \u2022 the ability of the Advisor to attract and retain highly talented professionals; \n \u2022 fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; \n \u2022 the impact of changes to tax legislation and, generally, our tax position; \n \u2022 our ability to exit a control investment in a timely manner; and \n \u2022 the ability to fund Logan JV's unfunded commitments to the extent approved by each member of the Logan JV investment committee. \nOverview\nTHL Credit, Inc., or we, us, our or the Company, was organized as a Delaware corporation on May 26, 2009 and initially funded on July 23, 2009. We commenced principal operations on April 21, 2010. Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation, primarily through investments in privately negotiated investments in debt and equity securities of lower middle market companies.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we, together with our credit-focused affiliates, collectively had $11.6 billion of assets under management. This amount included our assets, assets of the managed funds and a separate account managed by us, and assets of the collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), separate accounts and various fund formats, including any uncalled commitments of private funds, as managed by the investment professionals of the Advisor and/or its consolidated subsidiary.\nWe are a direct lender to lower middle market companies and invest primarily in directly originated first lien senior secured loans, including unitranche investments. In certain instances, we also make second lien, subordinated, or mezzanine, debt investments, which may include an associated equity component such as warrants, preferred stock or other similar securities and direct equity investments. Our first lien senior secured loans may be structured as traditional first lien senior secured loans or as unitranche loans. Unitranche structures combine characteristics of traditional first lien senior secured as well as second lien and subordinated loans and our unitranche loans will expose us to the risks associated with second lien and subordinated loans to the extent we invest in the last-out\u201d tranche or subordinated tranche (or piece) of the unitranche loan. We may also provide advisory services to managed funds.\nWe are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company, or BDC, under the Investment Company Act of 1940 Act, as amended, or the 1940 Act. As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70% of our total assets in qualifying assets,\u201d including securities of private or thinly traded public U.S. companies, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less.\nAs a BDC, we must not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets\u201d specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include investments in eligible portfolio companies.\u201d Under the relevant U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, rules the term eligible portfolio company\u201d includes all private companies, companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, and certain public companies that have listed their securities on a national securities exchange and have a market capitalization of less than $250 million, in each case organized in the United States.\nWe are also registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.\nSince April 2010, after we completed our initial public offering and commenced principal operations, through December 31, 2017, we have been responsible for making, on behalf of ourselves, managed funds and separately managed account, over $1,979 million in aggregate commitments into 100 separate portfolio companies through a combination of both initial and follow-on investments. Since April 2010 through December 31, 2017, we, along with our managed funds and separately managed account, have received $1,296 million of gross proceeds from the realization of investments. The Company alone has received $1,067 million of gross proceeds from the realization of its investments during this same time period.\nWe have elected to be treated for tax purposes as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements. Pursuant to these elections, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level income taxes on any income we distribute to our stockholders.\nPortfolio Composition and Investment Activity\nPortfolio Composition\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $608.7 million of portfolio investments (at fair value), which represents a $60.5 million, or 9.0% decrease from the $669.2 million (at fair value) as of December 31, 2016. Our portfolio consisted of 47 investments, including THL Credit Greenway Fund LLC, or Greenway, and THL Credit Greenway Fund II LLC, or Greenway II, as of December 31, 2017, compared to 47 portfolio investments, including Greenway and Greenway II, as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, we had $158.7 million of controlled portfolio investments (at fair value) in 6 portfolio companies, which represents an $8.5 million, or 5.1% decrease from $167.2 million (at fair value) as of December 31, 2016. The decrease in controlled portfolio companies was the result of exiting one controlled investment and changes in performance of certain investments. Our average controlling equity position at December 31, 2017 was approximately $25.9 million and $26.5 million at cost and fair value, respectively. Our average controlling equity position at December 31, 2016 was approximately $26.5 million and $23.9 million at cost and fair value, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2017 and 2016, our average portfolio company investment, excluding Greenway, Greenway II, Logan JV, and portfolio investments where we only have an equity or fund investment and restructured investments where we converted debt to a controlling equity interest, at amortized cost and fair value, was approximately $14.5 million and $13.4 million and $16.0 million and $15.4 million, respectively. Including investments in funds, investments where we hold equity only positions or investments where we converted debt to a controlling equity position would not be representative of our typical portfolio investment size and were therefore excluded from the calculation. Our largest portfolio company investment as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, excluding the Logan JV and investments where we hold equity only positions or investments where we converted debt to a controlling equity position, by amortized cost and fair value was approximately $30.2 million and $30.5 million and $31.6 million and $30.5 million, respectively. Including such investments, our largest portfolio company investment as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 was our investment in the Logan JV, which totaled $67.0 million and $65.4 million and $59.0 million and $59.7 million at cost and fair value, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2017, based upon fair value, 93.1% of our debt investments bore interest based on floating rates, which may be subject to interest rate floors, such as the London Interbank offer rate, or LIBOR, and Canadian Dollar Offered Rate, or CDOR, and 6.9% bore interest at fixed rates. At December 31, 2016, 89.1% of our debt investments bore interest based on floating rates, which may be subject to interest rate floors, such as LIBOR, and 10.9% bore interest at fixed rates.\nThe following table shows the weighted average yield by investment category at their current cost.\nTable 199: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Description:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> First lien senior secured debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Second lien debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subordinated debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investments in payment rights (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CLO residual interests (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income-producing equity securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt and income-producing investments (1)(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Logan JV (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> All investments including Logan JV (1)(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Includes all loans on non-accrual status. \n (2) Yields from investments in payment rights and CLO residual interests represent an effective yield expected from anticipated cash flows. Our two remaining investments in CLO residual interests as of December 31, 2016 were sold in January 2017. \n (3) Includes yields on controlled investments, but excludes the yield on the Logan JV. \n (4) As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the distributions declared and earned of $9.3 million and $7.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, represented a yield to us of 14.2% and 14.1%, respectively, based on average capital invested. We expect the yield to fluctuate as a result of the timing of additional capital invested, the changes in asset yields in the underlying portfolio and the overall performance of the Logan JV investment portfolio. \nThe weighted average yield of our debt investments is not the same as a return on investment for our stockholders but, rather, relates to a portion of our investment portfolio and is calculated before the payment of our fees and expenses. The weighted average yield was computed using the effective interest rates as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, including accretion of original issue discount and loan origination fees. This weighted average yield reflects the impact of loans on non-accrual status. There can be no assurance that the weighted average yield will remain at its current level.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, portfolio investments, in which we have debt investments, had a median earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, of approximately $11 million and $12 million, respectively, based on the latest available financial information provided by the portfolio companies for each of these periods. As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, our median attachment point in the capital structure of our debt investments in portfolio companies is approximately 4.3 times and 4.3 times the portfolio company's EBITDA, respectively, based on our latest available financial information for each of these periods.\nWe expect the percent of our portfolio investments in unsponsored investments to decrease significantly over time as we work through restructurings, which may include providing additional liquidity through revolving loans, and ultimately exit our unsponsored investments. Going forward we expect unsponsored investments we make, if any, would only be in first lien senior secured investments. As of December 31, 2017, our portfolio of unsponsored investments included seven investments. Five are performing at or above our expectations and have an Investment Score of 1 or 2. Of the two other unsponsored investments, one has an Investment Score of 3 and the other an Investment Score of 5 and is on non-accrual. As of December 31, 2016, our portfolio of unsponsored investments included seven investments. Four were performing at or above our expectations and had an Investment Score of 1 or 2. Three others had Investment Scores ranging from 3 to 5.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we have closed portfolio investments with 62 different sponsors since inception. As of December 31, 2016, we had closed portfolio investments with 56 different sponsors since inception.\nThe following table summarizes sponsored and unsponsored investments based on amortized cost and fair value (in millions).\nTable 204: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amortized\nCost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fair\nValue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fair\nValue\nas % of\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amortized\nCost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fair\nValue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fair\nValue\nas % of\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sponsored Investments (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 477.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 435.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 80.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 498.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 479.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 79.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unsponsored Investments (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 95.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 108.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 113.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 130.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 573.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 543.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 611.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 609.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Excludes THL Credit Greenway Fund I LLC, THL Credit Greenway Fund II LLC, and THL Credit Logan JV LLC. \nThe following table summarizes the amortized cost and fair value of investments as of December 31, 2017 (in millions).\nTable 206: <table> <tr> <td> Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amortized\nCost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage of\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fair Value (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage of\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> First lien senior secured debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 419.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 65.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 407.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 66.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity investments (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment in Logan JV\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 67.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 65.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Second lien debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subordinated debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment in payment rights\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investments in funds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Warrants\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 640.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 608.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) All investments are categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, except for investments in funds and the Logan JV, which are excluded from the fair value hierarchy in accordance with ASU 2015-07.

The frequency and volume of any prepayments may fluctuate significantly from period to period.\nAggregate Cash Flow Realized Gross Internal Rate of Return\nSince April 2010, after we completed our initial public offering and commenced principal operations, through December 31, 2017, our fully exited investments have resulted in an aggregate cash flow realized gross internal rate of return to us of 14.0% (based on cash invested of $945.0 million and total proceeds from these exited investments of $1,180.9 million). 85.5% of these exited investments resulted in an aggregate cash flow realized gross internal rate of return to us of 10% or greater. Internal rate of return, or IRR, is a measure of our discounted cash flows (inflows and outflows). Specifically, IRR is the discount rate at which the net present value of all cash flows is equal to zero. That is, IRR is the discount rate at which the present value of total cash invested in our investments is equal to the present value of all realized returns from the investments. Our IRR calculations are unaudited.\nCash invested, with respect to an investment, represents our aggregate cash investment in the debt or equity securities we acquire.\nRealized returns, with respect to an investment, represents the total cash received with respect to each investment, including all amortization payments, interest, dividends, prepayment fees, upfront fees, original issue discount, amendment fees and other fees and proceeds.\nGross IRR, with respect to an investment, is calculated based on"}
