Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion provides information about the major components of the results of operations and financial condition, liquidity and capital resources of F & M Bank Corp. and its subsidiaries. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements presented in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Information, of this Form 10-K.\nLending Activities\nCredit Policies\nThe principal risk associated with each of the categories of loans in our portfolio is the creditworthiness of our borrowers. Within each category, such risk is increased or decreased, depending on prevailing economic conditions. In an effort to manage the risk, our loan policy gives loan amount approval limits to individual loan officers based on their position and level of experience and to our loan committees based on the size of the lending relationship. The risk associated with real estate and construction loans, commercial loans and consumer loans varies, based on market employment levels, consumer confidence, fluctuations in the value of real estate and other conditions that affect the ability of borrowers to repay indebtedness. The risk associated with real estate construction loans varies, based on the supply and demand for the type of real estate under construction.\nWe have written policies and procedures to help manage credit risk. We have a loan review policy that includes regular portfolio reviews to establish loss exposure and to ascertain compliance with our loan policy.\nWe use a management loan committee and a directors' loan committee to approve loans. The management loan committee is comprised of members of senior management, and the directors' loan committee is comprised of any six directors. Both committees approve new, renewed and or modified loans that exceed officer loan authorities. The directors' loan committee also reviews any changes to our lending policies, which are then approved by our board of directors.\nConstruction and Development Lending\nWe make construction loans, primarily residential, and land acquisition and development loans. The construction loans are secured by residential houses under construction and the underlying land for which the loan was obtained. The average life of a construction loan is approximately 12 months, and it is typically re-priced as the prime rate of interest changes. The majority of the interest rates charged on these loans float with the market. Construction lending entails significant additional risks, compared with residential mortgage lending. Construction loans often involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Another risk involved in construction lending is attributable to the fact that loan funds are advanced upon the security of the land or home under construction, which value is estimated prior to the completion of construction. Thus, it is more difficult to evaluate accurately the total loan funds required to complete a project and related loan-to-value ratios. To mitigate the risks associated with construction lending, we generally limit loan amounts to 75% to 90% of appraised value, in addition to analyzing the creditworthiness of our borrowers. We also obtain a first lien on the property as security for our construction loans and typically require personal guarantees from the borrower's principal owners.\nPART II, continued\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nCommercial Real Estate Lending\nCommercial real estate loans are secured by various types of commercial real estate in our market area, including multi-family residential buildings, commercial buildings and offices, shopping centers and churches. Commercial real estate lending entails significant additional risks, compared with residential mortgage lending. Commercial real estate loans typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Additionally, the payment experience on loans secured by income producing properties is typically dependent on the successful operation of a business or a real estate project and thus may be subject, to a greater extent, to adverse conditions in the real estate market or in the economy in general. Our commercial real estate loan underwriting criteria require an examination of debt service coverage ratios and the borrower's creditworthiness, prior credit history and reputation. We also evaluate the location of the security property and typically require personal guarantees or endorsements of the borrower's principal owners.\nBusiness Lending\nBusiness loans generally have a higher degree of risk than residential mortgage loans but have higher yields. To manage these risks, we generally obtain appropriate collateral and personal guarantees from the borrower's principal owners and monitor the financial condition of our business borrowers. Residential mortgage loans generally are made on the basis of the borrower's ability to make repayment from employment and other income and are secured by real estate whose value tends to be readily ascertainable. In contrast, business loans typically are made on the basis of the borrower's ability to make repayment from cash flow from its business and are secured by business assets, such as real estate, accounts receivable, equipment and inventory. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of business loans is substantially dependent on the success of the business itself. Furthermore, the collateral for business loans may depreciate over time and generally cannot be appraised with as much precision as residential real estate.\nConsumer Lending\nWe offer various consumer loans, including personal loans and lines of credit, automobile loans, deposit account loans, installment and demand loans, and home equity lines of credit and loans. Such loans are generally made to clients with whom we have a pre-existing relationship. We currently originate all of our consumer loans in our geographic market area.\nThe underwriting standards employed by us for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant's payment history on other debts and an assessment of their ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. The stability of the applicant's monthly income may be determined by verification of gross monthly income from primary employment and additionally from any verifiable secondary income. Although creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes an analysis of the value of the security in relation to the proposed loan amount. For home equity lines of credit and loans we require title insurance, hazard insurance and, if required, flood insurance.\nResidential Mortgage Lending\nThe Bank makes residential mortgage loans for the purchase or refinance of existing loans with loan to value limits ranging between 80 and 90% depending on the age of the property, borrower's income and credit worthiness. Loans that are retained in our portfolio generally carry adjustable rates that can change every three to five years, based on amortization periods of twenty to thirty years.\nPART II, continued\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nLoans Held for Sale\nThe Bank makes fixed rate mortgage loans with terms of typically fifteen or thirty years through its subsidiary VBS Mortgage. These loans are funded by VBS utilizing a line of credit at the Bank until sold to investors in the secondary market. Similarly, the Bank also has a relationship with Northpointe Bank in Grand Rapids, MI whereby it purchases fixed rate conforming 1-4 family mortgage loans for short periods of time pending those loans being sold to investors in the secondary market. These loans have an average duration of ten days to two weeks, but occasionally remain on the Bank's books for up to 60 days. The Bank began its relationship with Northpointe Bank in 2014 and had a similar program with a prior bank since 2003. This relationship allows the Bank to achieve a higher rate of return than is available on other short term investment opportunities.\nDealer Finance Division\nIn September 2012, the Bank started a loan production office in Penn Laird, VA which specializes in providing automobile financing through a network of automobile dealers. The Dealer Finance Division was originally staffed with three officers that have extensive experience in Dealer Finance. Based on the strong growth of this division the staff has been increased to six employees. This office is serving the automobile finance needs for customers of dealers throughout the existing geographic footprint of the Bank. Approximately fifty dealers have signed contracts to originate loans on behalf of the Bank. As of year end 2017, the division had total loans outstanding of $75.2 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nGeneral\nThe Company's financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The financial information contained within the statements is, to a significant extent, financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. The Company's financial position and results of operations are affected by management's application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues, expenses and related disclosures. Different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the Company's consolidated financial position and/or results of operations.\nIn addition, GAAP itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method. Although the economics of these transactions would be the same, the timing of events that would impact these transactions could change. Following is a summary of the Company's significant accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates, assumptions and judgments.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in the loan portfolio. The allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting: (i) ASC 450 (formerly SFAS No. 5) Contingencies\u201d, which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable and (ii) ASC 310 (formerly SFAS No. 114), Receivables\u201d, which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral, present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance. The Company's allowance for loan losses is the accumulation of various components that are calculated based on independent methodologies. All components of the allowance represent an estimation performed pursuant to either ASC 450 or ASC 310. Management's estimate of each ASC 450 component is based on certain observable data that management believes are most reflective of the underlying credit losses being estimated. This evaluation includes credit quality trends; collateral values; loan volumes; geographic, borrower and industry concentrations; seasoning of the loan portfolio; the findings of internal credit quality assessments and results from external bank regulatory examinations. These factors, as well as historical losses and current economic and business conditions, are used in developing estimated loss factors used in the calculations.\nPART II, continued\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\nAllowance for Loan Losses, continued\nAllowances for loans are determined by applying estimated loss factors to the portfolio based on management's evaluation and risk grading\u201d of the loan portfolio. Specific allowances are typically provided on all impaired loans in excess of a defined loan size threshold that are classified in the Substandard or Doubtful risk grades. The specific reserves are determined on a loan-by-loan basis based on management's evaluation of the Company's exposure for each credit, given the current payment status of the loan and the value of any underlying collateral.\nWhile management uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan and lease losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the valuations or, if required by regulators, based upon information available to them at the time of their examinations. Such adjustments to original estimates, as necessary, are made in the period in which these factors and other relevant considerations indicate that loss levels may vary from previous estimates.\nGoodwill and Intangibles\nIn June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASC 805, Business Combinations and ASC 350, Intangibles. The provisions of ASC 350 discontinue and amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Instead, these assets are subject to an annual impairment review and more frequently if certain impairment indicators are in evidence. ASC 350 also requires that reporting units be identified for the purpose of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill.\nThe Company adopted ASC 350 on January 1, 2002. Goodwill totaled $2,639,000 at January 1, 2002. As of December 31, 2008, the Company recognized $31,000 in additional goodwill related to the purchase of 70% ownership in VBS Mortgage. In 2017 the Company recognized $211,000 in goodwill and $285,000 in intangibles related to the purchase of 76% ownership in VST. The goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually. Based on this testing, there were no impairment charges for 2017, 2016 or 2015. The Intangibles related to the VST purchase are amortized over periods up to 15 years with $53,000 recorded in 2017.\nIncome Tax\nThe determination of income taxes represents results in income and expense being recognized in different periods for financial reporting purposes versus for the purpose of computing income taxes currently payable. Deferred taxes are provided on such temporary differences and are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled. Further, the Company seeks strategies that minimize the tax effect of implementing its business strategies. Management makes judgments regarding the ultimate consequence of long-term tax planning strategies, including the likelihood of future recognition of deferred tax benefits. As a result, it is considered a significant estimate.\nPART II, continued\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\nFair Value\nThe estimate of fair value involves the use of (1) quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets, (2) quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques using significant assumptions that are observable in the market or (3) model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. When observable market prices and parameters are not fully available, management's judgment is necessary to arrive at fair value including estimates of current market participant expectations of future cash flows, risk premiums, among other things. Additionally, significant judgment may be required to determine whether certain assets measured at fair value are classified within the fair value hierarchy as Level 2 or Level 3. The estimation process and the potential materiality of the amounts involved result in this item being identified as critical.\nPension Plan Accounting\nThe accounting guidance for the measurement and recognition of obligations and expense related to pension plans generally applies the concept that the cost of benefits provided during retirement should be recognized over the employees' active working life. Inherent in this concept is the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date. Major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of benefits expense and accumulated obligation include discount rates, expected return on assets, mortality rates, and projected salary increases, among others. Changes in assumptions or judgments related to any of these variables could result in significant volatility in the Company's financial condition and results of operations. As a result, accounting for the Company's pension expense and obligation is considered a significant estimate. The estimation process and the potential materiality of the amounts involved result in this item being identified as critical.\nOther Real Estate Owned (OREO)\nOREO is held for sale and represents real estate acquired through or in lieu of foreclosure. OREO is initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. Physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan occurs when legal title is obtained upon completion of foreclosure or when the borrower conveys all interest in the property to satisfy the loan through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a similar legal agreement. The Company's policy is to carry OREO on its balance sheet at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. If fair value declines subsequent to foreclosure, a valuation allowance is recorded through expense. Operating costs after acquisition are expensed.\nPART II, continued\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\nOverview\nThe Company's net income for 2017 totaled $9,010,000 or $2.63 per common share, a decrease of 5.83% from $9,568,000 or $2.77 a share in 2016. Return on average equity decreased in 2017 to 10.01% versus 11.18% in 2016, and the return on average assets decreased from 1.34% in 2016 to 1.21% in 2017. These results reflect an $811,000 tax adjustment due to the write down of deferred tax assets as a result of the change in federal corporate income tax rate from 34% to 21% with the passing of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act.\nSee page 19 for a five-year summary of selected financial data.\nChanges in Net Income per Common Share (Basic)\nTable 11: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nto 2016\n</td> <td>\nto 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Prior Year Net Income Per Common Share (Basic)\n</td> <td> $2.77\n</td> <td> $2.40\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change from differences in:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income\n</td> <td> .52\n</td> <td> .62\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for loan losses\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> .09\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest income, excluding securities gains\n</td> <td> 1.36\n</td> <td> (.08)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Security gains (losses), net\n</td> <td> (.01)\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest expenses1\n</td> <td> (1.66)\n</td> <td> (.40)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income taxes\n</td> <td> (.38)\n</td> <td> .12\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of preferred stock dividend\n</td> <td> .02\n</td> <td> .01\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in average shares outstanding\n</td> <td> .01\n</td> <td> .01\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Change\n</td> <td> (.14)\n</td> <td> .37\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income Per Common Share (Basic)\n</td> <td> $2.63\n</td> <td> $2.77\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n1Noninterest income and noninterest expense reflect the reclassification of VBS to record gross income/expense rather than net.\nNet Interest Income\nThe largest source of operating revenue for the Company is net interest income, which is calculated as the difference between the interest earned on earning assets and the interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities. Net interest income increased 5.78% from 2016 to 2017 following an increase of 7.60% from 2015 to 2016. The net interest margin is the net interest income expressed as a percentage of interest earning assets. Changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, along with their yields and rates, have a significant impact on the level of net interest income. Tax equivalent net interest income for 2017 was $30,342,000 representing an increase of $1,714,000 or 5.99% over the prior year. A 7.60% increase in 2016 versus 2015 resulted in total tax equivalent net interest income of $28,683,000.\nIn this discussion and in the tabular analysis of net interest income performance, entitled Consolidated Average Balances, Yields and Rates,\u201d (found on page 26), the interest earned on tax exempt loans and investment securities has been adjusted to reflect the amount that would have been earned had these investments been subject to normal income taxation. This is referred to as tax equivalent net interest income. For a reconciliation of tax equivalent net interest income to GAAP measures, see the table on page 40.\nTax equivalent income on earning assets increased $2,012,000 in 2017 compared to 2016. Loans held for investment, expressed as a percentage of total earning assets, increased in 2017 to 90.29% as compared to 86.02% in 2016. During 2017, yields on earning assets increased 23 basis points (BP), primarily due to rate increases during 2017 specifically in commercial loans, investments and federal funds sold. The average cost of interest bearing liabilities increased 6BP in 2017, following an increase of 9BP in 2016. The increase in 2017 in due to increased cost of deposits and debt as rates increased.\nThe analysis on the next page reveals an increase in the net interest margin to 4.53% in 2017 from 4.34% in 2016, primarily due to changes in balance sheet leverage and increased interest rates during the year.\nPART II, Continued\nItem 7.

Overall, the yield on earning assets increased .23%, from 4.89% to 5.12%. Average loans held for investment grew during 2017, with average loans outstanding increasing $36,913,000 to $604,261,000. Average real estate loans increased 5.89%, commercial loans increased 3.55% and consumer installment loans increased 15.62% on average. The increase in average consumer loans is a result of the growth in our Dealer Finance Division which opened at the end of 2012. The increase in tax equivalent interest income is primarily due to the growth in the loan portfolio, with commercial loans contributing the most interest income growth.\nPART II, Continued\nItem 7.

The average cost of funds of .83% increased .06% compared to 2016, which followed an increase of .09% in 2016 compared to 2015. Average interest bearing liabilities increased $388,000 in 2017 following an increase of $43,486,000 in 2016. The average interest bearing liabilities have remained flat in 2017 and increased 10.24% in 2016. Changes in the cost of funds attributable to rate and volume variances can be found in the table at the top of page 27.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income continues to be an increasingly important factor in maintaining and growing profitability. Management is conscious of the need to constantly review fee income and develop additional sources of complementary revenue. During 2017, VBS Mortgage's income was reclassified to report gross income and gross expenses in the appropriate income statement categories rather than netting in noninterest income, 2016 and 2015 income statements were reclassified to be comparative.\nNoninterest income, exclusive of security gains or losses, increased 42.14% or $2,352,000, in 2017 following an increase of 16.46% in 2016. The increase is due to the addition of VST Title, increases in VBS Mortgage gross revenue and service charges on deposit account. In addition, the FHLB prepayment gain of $504,000 is recorded in noninterest income. The losses on low income housing projects decreased 14.5% for 2017 due to recognition of $162,000 in gains related to a fund that was dissolved. The 2016 increase over 2015 was primarily due to record earnings at VBS Mortgage.\nThe Company reported an investment loss related to both the Bank and VBS exiting the Bankers Title investment in 2017. The total loss was $42,000. There were no security transactions in 2016 or 2015 which resulted in a gain or loss.\nPART II, Continued\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expenses increased from $21,272,000 in 2016 to $24,719,000 in 2017, a 16.20% increase. Salary and benefits increased 16.05% to $14,854,000 in 2017 following an increase of 11.72% in 2016. This increase was the result of normal salary increases, additions to staff for new branches, the addition of VS Title (in 2017) and administrative positions as well as increasing benefit costs (including health care cost, pension expense and profit sharing expenses). Occupancy and Equipment expenses increased $268,000 or 16.72% due to the growth in our branch network following an increase of 5.74% in 2016. Other operating expenses increased $1,125,000 in 2017, following a $288,000 increase in 2016. The primary increases were in the areas of information technology ($211,000), credit and debit card related services ($114,000), contributions ($266,000), and VBS and VST other operating expense growth ($101,000). The 2016 primary increases were in advertising and employee appreciation ($70,000), other loan related costs ($127,000), legal and professional expense ($108,000) and checking account program expenses ($257,000). Total noninterest expense as a percentage of average assets totaled 3.32%, 2.98%, and 3.04%, in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. With the growth in branches, addition of VST and increased staff at VBS mortgage noninterest expenses have shown increase relative to peer data. Peer group averages (as reported in the most recent Uniform Bank Performance Report) have ranged between 2.80%, 2.84% and 2.86% over the same time period.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nManagement evaluates the loan portfolio in light of national and local economic trends, changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and industry standards. Specific factors considered by management in determining the adequacy of the level of the allowance for loan losses include internally generated loan review reports, past due reports and historical loan loss experience. This review also considers concentrations of loans in terms of geography, business type and level of risk. Management evaluates nonperforming loans relative to their collateral value, when deemed collateral dependent, and makes the appropriate adjustments to the allowance for loan losses when needed. Based on the factors outlined above, the current year provision for loan losses remained at $0 as in 2016. The current levels of the allowance for loan losses reflect increased net charge-off activity, loan growth, and other credit risk factors that the Company considers in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. The Company has experienced an increase in past due loans and nonperforming loans at year end; the nonperforming loans increase can be attributed to one borrower ($1.1 million) that has a specific reserve in the allowance for loan losses; the past due loan increase is primarily attributed to one borrower ($5.9 million) that is being closely monitored. Management is in the process of restructuring the relationship and has determined that there is no impairment at this time. Management will continue to monitor nonperforming and past due loans and will make necessary adjustments to specific reserves and record provision for loan losses if conditions change regarding collateral values or cash flow expectations. Management anticipates the Bank will need to record provision expense in 2018 due to expected growth and a normalized historical charge-off rate.\nActual net loan charge-offs were $1,499,000 in 2017 and $1,238,000 in 2016. Net charge-offs as a percentage of loans held for investment totaled .24% and .21% in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Dealer Finance Division's charge-off percentage is the largest category at .11% of loans held for investment and land development was .09%. As stated in the most recently available Uniform Bank Performance Report (UPBR), peer group loss averages were .10% in 2017 and .11% in 2016. The Bank anticipates losses will remain above peer due to the Dealer Finance Division, however these losses have been in line with expectations and are more than offset by the increased yield derived from this portfolio.\nBalance Sheet\nTotal assets increased 1.13% during the year to $753,270,000, an increase of $8,381,000 from $744,889,000 in 2016. Loans held for investment grew $25,338,000, Bank premises and equipment increased $5,554,000, whereas loans held for sale decreased $22,960,000 and other asset categories experienced modest fluctuations. Average earning assets increased 1.47% or $9,720,000 to $669,267,000 at December 31, 2017. The increase in earning assets is due largely to the growth in the loans held for investment offset by the decrease in short-term loan participation program with Northpointe Bank. Deposits grew $32,092,000 and other liabilities decreased $28,304,000 in 2017. Average interest bearing deposits increased $20,955,000 for 2017 or 5.60%, with increases in both interest-bearing demand accounts and savings accounts. There was a slight decrease in the time deposit category. The Company continues to utilize its assets well, with 89.95% of average assets consisting of earning assets.\nPART II, Continued\nItem 7.

Average balances in investment securities decreased 30.48% in 2017 to $11,011,000. At year end, 1.65% of average earning assets of the Company were held as investment securities, all of which are unpledged. Management strives to match the types and maturities of securities owned to balance projected liquidity needs, interest rate sensitivity and to maximize earnings through a portfolio bearing low credit risk. Portfolio yields averaged 3.07% for 2017, up from 2.37% in 2016.\nThere were no Other Than Temporary Impairments (OTTI) write-downs in 2017, 2016 or 2015.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nAnalysis of Loan Portfolio\nThe Company's market area has a relatively stable economy which tends to be less cyclical than the national economy. Major industries in the market area include agricultural production and processing, higher education, retail sales, services and light manufacturing.\nThe Company's portfolio of loans held for investment totaled $616,974,000 at December 31, 2017 compared with $591,636,000 at the beginning of the year. The Company's policy has been to make conservative loans that are held for future interest income, utilizing prudent underwriting and a strong loan review program. Collateral required by the Company is determined on an individual basis depending on the purpose of the loan and the financial condition of the borrower. Commercial loans, including agricultural and multifamily loans, increased 3.89% during 2017 to $209,721,000. Real estate mortgages increased $12,260,000 or 5.14%. Growth has included a variety of loan and collateral types including owner occupied residential real estate and residential rental properties. Construction loans decreased $4,552,000 or 5.98%. The Bank also has loan participation arrangements with several other banks within the region to aid in diversification of the loan portfolio geographically, by collateral type and by borrower.\nConsumer installment loans increased $9,411,000 or 13.06%. This category includes personal loans, auto loans and other loans to individuals. This category began increasing during the fourth quarter of 2012 due to the opening of the Dealer Finance Division in Penn Laird, Virginia; at year end this Division had a loan portfolio of $75,169,000. Credit card balances increased $117,000 to $2,939,000 but are a minor component of the loan portfolio.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nAnalysis of Loan Portfolio, continued\nResidential real estate loans are generally made for a period not to exceed 25 years and are secured by a first deed of trust which normally does not exceed 90% of the appraised value. If the loan to value ratio exceeds 90%, the Company requires additional collateral, guarantees or mortgage insurance. On approximately 94% of the real estate loans, interest is adjustable after each one, three or five-year period. The remainder of the portfolio is comprised of fixed rate loans that are generally made for a fifteen-year or a twenty-year period with an interest rate adjustment after ten years.\nSince 1992, fixed rate real estate loans have been funded with fixed rate borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank, which allows the Company to control its interest rate risk. In addition, the Company makes home equity loans secured by second deeds of trust with total indebtedness not to exceed 90% of the appraised value. Home equity loans are made for three, five or ten year periods at a fixed rate or as a revolving line of credit.\nConstruction loans may be made to individuals, who have arranged with a contractor for the construction of a residence, or to contractors that are involved in building pre-sold, spec-homes or subdivisions. The majority of commercial loans are made to small retail, manufacturing and service businesses. Consumer loans are made for a variety of reasons; however, approximately 74% of the loans are secured by automobiles and trucks.\nApproximately 80% of the Company's loans are secured by real estate; however, policies relating to appraisals and loan to value ratios are adequate to control the related risk. Market values appear to have rebounded from the recession with modest increases in 2015, 2016, and 2017. Unemployment rates in the Company's market area continue to be below both the national and state averages.\nThe Bank has not identified any loan categories that would be considered loan concentrations of greater than 25% of capital. While the Bank has not developed a formal policy limiting the concentration level to any particular loan type or industry segment, it has established target limits on both a nominal and percentage of capital basis. Concentrations are monitored and reported to the board of directors quarterly. Concentration levels have been used by management to determine how aggressively we may price or pursue new loan requests. At December 31, 2017, there are no industry categories of loans that exceed 10% of total loans.\nNonaccrual and Past Due Loans\nNonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans and loans 90 days or more past due. Nonaccrual loans are loans on which interest accruals have been suspended or discontinued permanently. The Company would have earned approximately $102,000 in additional interest income had the loans on nonaccrual status been current and performing. Nonperforming loans totaled $7,102,000 at December 31, 2017 compared to $4,870,000 at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, $198,000 of loans 90 days or more past due were not on nonaccrual status. Approximately 88% of these nonperforming loans are secured by real estate. Although management expects that there may be additional loan losses, the Bank believes that it is generally well secured and continues to actively work with its customers to effect payment. As of December 31, 2017, the Company holds $1,984,000 of real estate which was acquired through foreclosure.\nNonperforming loans have increased approximately $2,232,000 since December 31, 2016. Of the increase, $1.5 million relates to two borrowers; one of which has sold equipment and the loan will be modified for collection of the remaining balance, with no loss anticipated as of December 31, 2017. The other relationship is in the process of subdividing property to sell in order to bring the loan current; this loan has been reviewed for impairment and has a specific reserve of $249,000 in our allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2017.\nPART II, Continued\nItem 7.

Nor do they represent material credits about which management is aware of any information which causes it to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the loan repayment terms. As of December 31, 2017, management is not aware of any potential problem loans which are not already classified for regulatory purposes or on the watch list as part of the Bank's internal grading system.\nPART II, Continued\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nLoan Losses and the Allowance for Loan Losses\nIn evaluating the portfolio, loans are segregated into loans with identified potential losses, pools of loans by type, with separate weighting for past dues and adverse rated loans, and a general allowance based on a variety of criteria. Loans with identified potential losses include examiner and bank classified loans. Classified relationships in excess of $500,000 and loans identified as troubled debt restructurings are reviewed individually for impairment under ASC 310. A variety of factors are considered when reviewing these credits, including borrower cash flow, payment history, fair value of collateral, company management, industry and economic factors.\nLoans that are not impaired are categorized by call report code into unimpaired and classified loans. For unimpaired loans an estimate is calculated based on actual loss experience over the last five years, for loans of that type. During 2015, the Company felt the two-year loss history utilized in 2014 and prior would not be indicative of the amount of losses that could occur in our current economic cycle, therefore the loss history was expanded to five years to capture a more representative loss history. Dealer finance loans utilize a two-year loss history. The Company monitors the net losses for this division and adjusts based on how the portfolio performs since the department was established in 2012. For classified loans, loans are grouped by call code and past due or adverse risk rating. Loss rates are assigned based on actual loss experience over the last five years multiplied by a risk factor. The Dealer finance loans are given a higher risk factor for past due and adverse risk ratings based on back testing of the risk factors.\nA general allowance for inherent losses has been established to reflect other unidentified losses within the portfolio. The general allowance is calculated using nine qualitative factors identified in the 2006 Interagency Policy Statement on the allowance for loan losses. The general allowance assists in managing recent changes in portfolio risk that may not be captured in individually impaired loans, or in the homogeneous pools based on loss histories. The Board approves the loan loss provision for each quarter based on this evaluation.\nThe allowance for loan losses of $6,044,000 at December 31, 2017 is equal to .98% of total loans held for investment. This compares to an allowance of $7,543,000 or 1.27% at December 31, 2016 and 1.61% at December 31, 2015. Management and the Board of Directors feel that the current reserve level is adequate based on the analysis of historical losses, delinquency rates, collateral values of delinquent loans and a thorough review of the loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans has decreased from 154.89% to 85.10% in 2017; increases in the nonperforming loans have been analyzed and, where necessary, a specific reserve has been recorded. In addition, past due and adversely risk rated loans have higher allocation factors within the allowance for loan losses calculation. The Company has experienced a continued decline in historical charge-off rates with 2017 replacing 2012 in the five-year lookback and the local economy showing continued improvements in unemployment. Management will continue to monitor relationships that have recently become past due but are not considered impaired at this time.\nLoan losses, net of recoveries, totaled $1,499,000 in 2017 which is equivalent to .24% of total loans outstanding.

Non-deposit borrowings are an important source of funding for the Bank. These sources assist in managing short and long-term funding needs, often at rates that are more favorable than raising additional funds within the deposit portfolio.\nBorrowings from the FHLB are used to support the Bank's lending program and allow the Bank to manage interest rate risk by laddering maturities and matching funding terms to the terms of various loan types in the loan portfolio. The Company did not borrow long term FHLB loans during 2017. This compares to $20,000,000 borrowed in 2016 and $40,000,000 in 2015. Repayment of amortizing and fixed maturity loans through FHLB totaled $14,429,000 during 2017, including prepayment of $10,000,000 resulting in a prepayment gain of $504,000.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nDeposits and Borrowings, continued\nStockholders' Equity\nTotal stockholders' equity increased $4,593,000 or 5.30% in 2017. Net income totaled $9,010,000, noncontrolling interest net income totaled $31,000, issuance of common stock totaled $197,000 and capital was reduced by dividends of $3,387,000, decreases in other comprehensive income of $295,000, repurchases of common stock of $712,000, repurchase of preferred stock $101,000 and minority interest distributions of $150,000. As of December 31, 2017, book value per common share was $25.73 compared to $24.18 as of December 31, 2016. Dividends are paid to stockholders on a quarterly basis in uniform amounts unless unexpected fluctuations in net income indicate a change to this policy is needed.\nThe Company adopted ASU 2018-02 which allows financial statement preparers an option to reclassify stranded tax effects within accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings in each period in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (or portion thereof) is recorded. Therefore retained earnings has been adjusted by $682,000 for reflect these changes.\nBanking regulators have established a uniform system to address the adequacy of capital for financial institutions. The rules require minimum capital levels based on risk-adjusted assets. Simply stated, the riskier an entity's investments, the more capital it is required to maintain. The Bank is required to maintain these minimum capital levels. In March 2015, the Bank implemented the Basel III capital requirements, which introduced the Common Equity Tier I ratio in addition to the two previous capital guidelines of Tier I capital (referred to as core capital) and Tier II capital (referred to as supplementary capital). At December 31, 2017, the Bank had Common Equity Tier I capital of 14.43%, Tier I capital of 14.43% of risk weighted assets and combined Tier I and II capital of 15.41% of risk weighted assets. Regulatory minimums at this date were 4.5%, 6% and 8%, respectively. The Bank has maintained capital levels far above the minimum requirements throughout the year. In the unlikely event that such capital levels are not met, regulatory agencies are empowered to require the Bank to raise additional capital and/or reallocate present capital.\nIn addition, the regulatory agencies have issued guidelines requiring the maintenance of a capital leverage ratio. The leverage ratio is computed by dividing Tier I capital by average total assets. The regulators have established a minimum of 4% for this ratio but can increase the minimum requirement based upon an institution's overall financial condition. At December 31, 2017, the Bank reported a leverage ratio of 12.07%. The Bank's leverage ratio was also substantially above the minimum. The Bank also reported a capital conservation buffer of 7.41% at December 31, 2017. The capital conservation buffer is designed to strengthen an institution's financial resilience during economic cycles. Financial institutions are required to maintain a minimum buffer as required by the Basel III final rules in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and other payments. Beginning January 1, 2016, a capital conservation buffer of 0.625% became effective. The capital conservations buffer for 2017 is 1.25% and will gradually be increased through January 1, 2019 to 2.5%.\nPART II, Continued\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nMarket Risk Management\nMost of the Company's net income is dependent on the Bank's net interest income. Rapid changes in short-term interest rates may lead to volatility in net interest income resulting in additional interest rate risk to the extent that imbalances exist between the maturities or repricing of interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets. The Company's net interest margin increased .19% in 2017 following a decrease of .09% in 2016. This increase is due to increases in interest rates in 2017, loan growth and the growth in noninterest bearing deposits to support loan growth. In December 2017, the Federal Open Market Committee elected to raise the short-term rates target .25% to 1.25 to 1.50% due to expanding economic activity.\nNet interest income is also affected by changes in the mix of funding that supports earning assets. For example, higher levels of non-interest bearing demand deposits and leveraging earning assets by funding with stockholder's equity would result in greater levels of net interest income than if most of the earning assets were funded with higher cost interest-bearing liabilities, such as certificates of deposit.\nLiquid assets, which include cash and cash equivalents, federal funds sold, interest bearing deposits and short term investments averaged $40,189,000 for 2017. The Bank historically has had a stable core deposit base and, therefore, does not have to rely on volatile funding sources. Because of the stable core deposit base, changes in interest rates should not have a significant effect on liquidity. The Bank's membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank has historically provided liquidity as the Bank borrows money that is repaid over a five to ten-year period and uses the money to make fixed rate loans. The matching of the long-term receivables and liabilities helps the Bank reduce its sensitivity to interest rate changes. The Company reviews its interest rate gap periodically and makes adjustments as needed. There are no off-balance sheet items that will impair future liquidity.\nThe following table depicts the Company's interest rate sensitivity, as measured by the repricing of its interest sensitive assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017. As the notes to the table indicate, the data was based in part on assumptions as to when certain assets or liabilities would mature or reprice. The analysis indicates an asset sensitive one-year cumulative GAP position of 21.36% of total earning assets, compared to 23.71% in 2016. Approximately 44.40% of rate sensitive assets and 32.83% of rate sensitive liabilities are subject to repricing within one year. Short term assets (less than one year) decreased $11,305,000 during the year, while total earning assets decreased $1,106,000. The decrease is attributed to a decrease in loans held for sale of $22,960,000 and a decrease in federal funds sold of $7,926,000 which were offset by growth in loans held for investment of $25,221,000 and investments of $3,832,000. Growth in the loans held for investment portfolio was concentrated in real estate secured loans, commercial and the Dealer Finance division.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion provides information about the major components of the results of operations and financial condition, liquidity and capital resources of F & M Bank Corp. and its subsidiaries. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements presented in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Information, of this Form 10-K.\nLending Activities\nCredit Policies\nThe principal risk associated with each of the categories of loans in our portfolio is the creditworthiness of our borrowers. Within each category, such risk is increased or decreased, depending on prevailing economic conditions. In an effort to manage the risk, our loan policy gives loan amount approval limits to individual loan officers based on their position and level of experience and to our loan committees based on the size of the lending relationship. The risk associated with real estate and construction loans, commercial loans and consumer loans varies, based on market employment levels, consumer confidence, fluctuations in the value of real estate and other conditions that affect the ability of borrowers to repay indebtedness. The risk associated with real estate construction loans varies, based on the supply and demand for the type of real estate under construction.\nWe have written policies and procedures to help manage credit risk. We have a loan review policy that includes regular portfolio reviews to establish loss exposure and to ascertain compliance with our loan policy.\nWe use a management loan committee and a directors' loan committee to approve loans. The management loan committee is comprised of members of senior management, and the directors' loan committee is comprised of any six directors. Both committees approve new, renewed and or modified loans that exceed officer loan authorities. The directors' loan committee also reviews any changes to our lending policies, which are then approved by our board of directors.\nConstruction and Development Lending\nWe make construction loans, primarily residential, and land acquisition and development loans. The construction loans are secured by residential houses under construction and the underlying land for which the loan was obtained. The average life of a construction loan is approximately 12 months, and it is typically re-priced as the prime rate of interest changes. The majority of the interest rates charged on these loans float with the market. Construction lending entails significant additional risks, compared with residential mortgage lending. Construction loans often involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Another risk involved in construction lending is attributable to the fact that loan funds are advanced upon the security of the land or home under construction, which value is estimated prior to the completion of construction. Thus, it is more difficult to evaluate accurately the total loan funds required to complete a project and related loan-to-value ratios. To mitigate the risks associated with construction lending, we generally limit loan amounts to 75% to 90% of appraised value, in addition to analyzing the creditworthiness of our borrowers. We also obtain a first lien on the property as security for our construction loans and typically require personal guarantees from the borrower's principal owners.\nPART II, continued\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nCommercial Real Estate Lending\nCommercial real estate loans are secured by various types of commercial real estate in our market area, including multi-family residential buildings, commercial buildings and offices, shopping centers and churches. Commercial real estate lending entails significant additional risks, compared with residential mortgage lending. Commercial real estate loans typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Additionally, the payment experience on loans secured by income producing properties is typically dependent on the successful operation of a business or a real estate project and thus may be subject, to a greater extent, to adverse conditions in the real estate market or in the economy in general. Our commercial real estate loan underwriting criteria require an examination of debt service coverage ratios and the borrower's creditworthiness, prior credit history and reputation. We also evaluate the location of the security property and typically require personal guarantees or endorsements of the borrower's principal owners.\nBusiness Lending\nBusiness loans generally have a higher degree of risk than residential mortgage loans but have higher yields. To manage these risks, we generally obtain appropriate collateral and personal guarantees from the borrower's principal owners and monitor the financial condition of our business borrowers. Residential mortgage loans generally are made on the basis of the borrower's ability to make repayment from employment and other income and are secured by real estate whose value tends to be readily ascertainable. In contrast, business loans typically are made on the basis of the borrower's ability to make repayment from cash flow from its business and are secured by business assets, such as real estate, accounts receivable, equipment and inventory. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of business loans is substantially dependent on the success of the business itself. Furthermore, the collateral for business loans may depreciate over time and generally cannot be appraised with as much precision as residential real estate.\nConsumer Lending\nWe offer various consumer loans, including personal loans and lines of credit, automobile loans, deposit account loans, installment and demand loans, and home equity lines of credit and loans. Such loans are generally made to clients with whom we have a pre-existing relationship. We currently originate all of our consumer loans in our geographic market area.\nThe underwriting standards employed by us for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant's payment history on other debts and an assessment of their ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. The stability of the applicant's monthly income may be determined by verification of gross monthly income from primary employment and additionally from any verifiable secondary income. Although creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes an analysis of the value of the security in relation to the proposed loan amount. For home equity lines of credit and loans we require title insurance, hazard insurance and, if required, flood insurance.\nResidential Mortgage Lending\nThe Bank makes residential mortgage loans for the purchase or refinance of existing loans with loan to value limits ranging between 80 and 90% depending on the age of the property, borrower's income and credit worthiness. Loans that are retained in our portfolio generally carry adjustable rates that can change every three to five years, based on amortization periods of twenty to thirty years.\nPART II, continued\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nLoans Held for Sale\nThe Bank makes fixed rate mortgage loans with terms of typically fifteen or thirty years through its subsidiary VBS Mortgage. These loans are funded by VBS utilizing a line of credit at the Bank until sold to investors in the secondary market. Similarly, the Bank also has a relationship with Northpointe Bank in Grand Rapids, MI whereby it purchases fixed rate conforming 1-4 family mortgage loans for short periods of time pending those loans being sold to investors in the secondary market. These loans have an average duration of ten days to two weeks, but occasionally remain on the Bank's books for up to 60 days. The Bank began its relationship with Northpointe Bank in 2014 and had a similar program with a prior bank since 2003. This relationship allows the Bank to achieve a higher rate of return than is available on other short term investment opportunities.\nDealer Finance Division\nIn September 2012, the Bank started a loan production office in Penn Laird, VA which specializes in providing automobile financing through a network of automobile dealers. The Dealer Finance Division was originally staffed with three officers that have extensive experience in Dealer Finance. Based on the strong growth of this division the staff has been increased to six employees. This office is serving the automobile finance needs for customers of dealers throughout the existing geographic footprint of the Bank. Approximately fifty dealers have signed contracts to originate loans on behalf of the Bank. As of year end 2017, the division had total loans outstanding of $75.2 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nGeneral\nThe Company's financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The financial information contained within the statements is, to a significant extent, financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. The Company's financial position and results of operations are affected by management's application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues, expenses and related disclosures. Different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the Company's consolidated financial position and/or results of operations.\nIn addition, GAAP itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method. Although the economics of these transactions would be the same, the timing of events that would impact these transactions could change. Following is a summary of the Company's significant accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates, assumptions and judgments.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in the loan portfolio. The allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting: (i) ASC 450 (formerly SFAS No. 5) Contingencies\u201d, which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable and (ii) ASC 310 (formerly SFAS No. 114), Receivables\u201d, which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral, present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance. The Company's allowance for loan losses is the accumulation of various components that are calculated based on independent methodologies. All components of the allowance represent an estimation performed pursuant to either ASC 450 or ASC 310. Management's estimate of each ASC 450 component is based on certain observable data that management believes are most reflective of the underlying credit losses being estimated. This evaluation includes credit quality trends; collateral values; loan volumes; geographic, borrower and industry concentrations; seasoning of the loan portfolio; the findings of internal credit quality assessments and results from external bank regulatory examinations. These factors, as well as historical losses and current economic and business conditions, are used in developing estimated loss factors used in the calculations.\nPART II, continued\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\nAllowance for Loan Losses, continued\nAllowances for loans are determined by applying estimated loss factors to the portfolio based on management's evaluation and risk grading\u201d of the loan portfolio. Specific allowances are typically provided on all impaired loans in excess of a defined loan size threshold that are classified in the Substandard or Doubtful risk grades. The specific reserves are determined on a loan-by-loan basis based on management's evaluation of the Company's exposure for each credit, given the current payment status of the loan and the value of any underlying collateral.\nWhile management uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan and lease losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the valuations or, if required by regulators, based upon information available to them at the time of their examinations. Such adjustments to original estimates, as necessary, are made in the period in which these factors and other relevant considerations indicate that loss levels may vary from previous estimates.\nGoodwill and Intangibles\nIn June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASC 805, Business Combinations and ASC 350, Intangibles. The provisions of ASC 350 discontinue and amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Instead, these assets are subject to an annual impairment review and more frequently if certain impairment indicators are in evidence. ASC 350 also requires that reporting units be identified for the purpose of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill.\nThe Company adopted ASC 350 on January 1, 2002. Goodwill totaled $2,639,000 at January 1, 2002. As of December 31, 2008, the Company recognized $31,000 in additional goodwill related to the purchase of 70% ownership in VBS Mortgage. In 2017 the Company recognized $211,000 in goodwill and $285,000 in intangibles related to the purchase of 76% ownership in VST. The goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually. Based on this testing, there were no impairment charges for 2017, 2016 or 2015. The Intangibles related to the VST purchase are amortized over periods up to 15 years with $53,000 recorded in 2017.\nIncome Tax\nThe determination of income taxes represents results in income and expense being recognized in different periods for financial reporting purposes versus for the purpose of computing income taxes currently payable. Deferred taxes are provided on such temporary differences and are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled. Further, the Company seeks strategies that minimize the tax effect of implementing its business strategies. Management makes judgments regarding the ultimate consequence of long-term tax planning strategies, including the likelihood of future recognition of deferred tax benefits. As a result, it is considered a significant estimate.\nPART II, continued\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\nFair Value\nThe estimate of fair value involves the use of (1) quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets, (2) quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques using significant assumptions that are observable in the market or (3) model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. When observable market prices and parameters are not fully available, management's judgment is necessary to arrive at fair value including estimates of current market participant expectations of future cash flows, risk premiums, among other things. Additionally, significant judgment may be required to determine whether certain assets measured at fair value are classified within the fair value hierarchy as Level 2 or Level 3. The estimation process and the potential materiality of the amounts involved result in this item being identified as critical.\nPension Plan Accounting\nThe accounting guidance for the measurement and recognition of obligations and expense related to pension plans generally applies the concept that the cost of benefits provided during retirement should be recognized over the employees' active working life. Inherent in this concept is the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date. Major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of benefits expense and accumulated obligation include discount rates, expected return on assets, mortality rates, and projected salary increases, among others. Changes in assumptions or judgments related to any of these variables could result in significant volatility in the Company's financial condition and results of operations. As a result, accounting for the Company's pension expense and obligation is considered a significant estimate. The estimation process and the potential materiality of the amounts involved result in this item being identified as critical.\nOther Real Estate Owned (OREO)\nOREO is held for sale and represents real estate acquired through or in lieu of foreclosure. OREO is initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. Physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan occurs when legal title is obtained upon completion of foreclosure or when the borrower conveys all interest in the property to satisfy the loan through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a similar legal agreement. The Company's policy is to carry OREO on its balance sheet at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. If fair value declines subsequent to foreclosure, a valuation allowance is recorded through expense. Operating costs after acquisition are expensed.\nPART II, continued\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\nOverview\nThe Company's net income for 2017 totaled $9,010,000 or $2.63 per common share, a decrease of 5.83% from $9,568,000 or $2.77 a share in 2016. Return on average equity decreased in 2017 to 10.01% versus 11.18% in 2016, and the return on average assets decreased from 1.34% in 2016 to 1.21% in 2017. These results reflect an $811,000 tax adjustment due to the write down of deferred tax assets as a result of the change in federal corporate income tax rate from 34% to 21% with the passing of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act.\nSee page 19 for a five-year summary of selected financial data.\nChanges in Net Income per Common Share (Basic)\n\n1Noninterest income and noninterest expense reflect the reclassification of VBS to record gross income/expense rather than net.\nNet Interest Income\nThe largest source of operating revenue for the Company is net interest income, which is calculated as the difference between the interest earned on earning assets and the interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities. Net interest income increased 5.78% from 2016 to 2017 following an increase of 7.60% from 2015 to 2016. The net interest margin is the net interest income expressed as a percentage of interest earning assets. Changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, along with their yields and rates, have a significant impact on the level of net interest income. Tax equivalent net interest income for 2017 was $30,342,000 representing an increase of $1,714,000 or 5.99% over the prior year. A 7.60% increase in 2016 versus 2015 resulted in total tax equivalent net interest income of $28,683,000.\nIn this discussion and in the tabular analysis of net interest income performance, entitled Consolidated Average Balances, Yields and Rates,\u201d (found on page 26), the interest earned on tax exempt loans and investment securities has been adjusted to reflect the amount that would have been earned had these investments been subject to normal income taxation. This is referred to as tax equivalent net interest income. For a reconciliation of tax equivalent net interest income to GAAP measures, see the table on page 40.\nTax equivalent income on earning assets increased $2,012,000 in 2017 compared to 2016. Loans held for investment, expressed as a percentage of total earning assets, increased in 2017 to 90.29% as compared to 86.02% in 2016. During 2017, yields on earning assets increased 23 basis points (BP), primarily due to rate increases during 2017 specifically in commercial loans, investments and federal funds sold. The average cost of interest bearing liabilities increased 6BP in 2017, following an increase of 9BP in 2016. The increase in 2017 in due to increased cost of deposits and debt as rates increased.\nThe analysis on the next page reveals an increase in the net interest margin to 4.53% in 2017 from 4.34% in 2016, primarily due to changes in balance sheet leverage and increased interest rates during the year.\nPART II, Continued\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nConsolidated Average Balances, Yields and Rates1\n\nIncome and yields are presented on a tax-equivalent basis using the applicable federal income tax rate of 34%.\nInterest income on loans includes loan fees.\nAverage balance information is reflective of historical cost and has not been adjusted for changes in market value.\nIncludes nonaccrual loans.\nPART II, Continued\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nThe following table illustrates the effect of changes in volumes and rates.\n\nNote: Volume changes have been determined by multiplying the prior years' average rate by the change in average balances outstanding. The rate change is determined by multiplying the current year average balance outstanding by the change in rate from the prior year to the current year.\nInterest Income\nTax equivalent interest income increased $2,012,000 or 6.24% in 2017, after increasing 9.31% or $2,744,000 in 2016. Overall, the yield on earning assets increased .23%, from 4.89% to 5.12%. Average loans held for investment grew during 2017, with average loans outstanding increasing $36,913,000 to $604,261,000. Average real estate loans increased 5.89%, commercial loans increased 3.55% and consumer installment loans increased 15.62% on average. The increase in average consumer loans is a result of the growth in our Dealer Finance Division which opened at the end of 2012. The increase in tax equivalent interest income is primarily due to the growth in the loan portfolio, with commercial loans contributing the most interest income growth.\nPART II, Continued\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nThe following table provides detail on the components of tax equivalent net interest income:\n\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $298,000 or 8.28% during 2017, which followed a 25.14% increase or $723,000 in 2016. The average cost of funds of .83% increased .06% compared to 2016, which followed an increase of .09% in 2016 compared to 2015. Average interest bearing liabilities increased $388,000 in 2017 following an increase of $43,486,000 in 2016. The average interest bearing liabilities have remained flat in 2017 and increased 10.24% in 2016. Changes in the cost of funds attributable to rate and volume variances can be found in the table at the top of page 27.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income continues to be an increasingly important factor in maintaining and growing profitability. Management is conscious of the need to constantly review fee income and develop additional sources of complementary revenue. During 2017, VBS Mortgage's income was reclassified to report gross income and gross expenses in the appropriate income statement categories rather than netting in noninterest income, 2016 and 2015 income statements were reclassified to be comparative.\nNoninterest income, exclusive of security gains or losses, increased 42.14% or $2,352,000, in 2017 following an increase of 16.46% in 2016. The increase is due to the addition of VST Title, increases in VBS Mortgage gross revenue and service charges on deposit account. In addition, the FHLB prepayment gain of $504,000 is recorded in noninterest income. The losses on low income housing projects decreased 14.5% for 2017 due to recognition of $162,000 in gains related to a fund that was dissolved. The 2016 increase over 2015 was primarily due to record earnings at VBS Mortgage.\nThe Company reported an investment loss related to both the Bank and VBS exiting the Bankers Title investment in 2017. The total loss was $42,000. There were no security transactions in 2016 or 2015 which resulted in a gain or loss.\nPART II, Continued\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expenses increased from $21,272,000 in 2016 to $24,719,000 in 2017, a 16.20% increase. Salary and benefits increased 16.05% to $14,854,000 in 2017 following an increase of 11.72% in 2016. This increase was the result of normal salary increases, additions to staff for new branches, the addition of VS Title (in 2017) and administrative positions as well as increasing benefit costs (including health care cost, pension expense and profit sharing expenses). Occupancy and Equipment expenses increased $268,000 or 16.72% due to the growth in our branch network following an increase of 5.74% in 2016. Other operating expenses increased $1,125,000 in 2017, following a $288,000 increase in 2016. The primary increases were in the areas of information technology ($211,000), credit and debit card related services ($114,000), contributions ($266,000), and VBS and VST other operating expense growth ($101,000). The 2016 primary increases were in advertising and employee appreciation ($70,000), other loan related costs ($127,000), legal and professional expense ($108,000) and checking account program expenses ($257,000). Total noninterest expense as a percentage of average assets totaled 3.32%, 2.98%, and 3.04%, in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. With the growth in branches, addition of VST and increased staff at VBS mortgage noninterest expenses have shown increase relative to peer data. Peer group averages (as reported in the most recent Uniform Bank Performance Report) have ranged between 2.80%, 2.84% and 2.86% over the same time period.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nManagement evaluates the loan portfolio in light of national and local economic trends, changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and industry standards. Specific factors considered by management in determining the adequacy of the level of the allowance for loan losses include internally generated loan review reports, past due reports and historical loan loss experience. This review also considers concentrations of loans in terms of geography, business type and level of risk. Management evaluates nonperforming loans relative to their collateral value, when deemed collateral dependent, and makes the appropriate adjustments to the allowance for loan losses when needed. Based on the factors outlined above, the current year provision for loan losses remained at $0 as in 2016. The current levels of the allowance for loan losses reflect increased net charge-off activity, loan growth, and other credit risk factors that the Company considers in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. The Company has experienced an increase in past due loans and nonperforming loans at year end; the nonperforming loans increase can be attributed to one borrower ($1.1 million) that has a specific reserve in the allowance for loan losses; the past due loan increase is primarily attributed to one borrower ($5.9 million) that is being closely monitored. Management is in the process of restructuring the relationship and has determined that there is no impairment at this time. Management will continue to monitor nonperforming and past due loans and will make necessary adjustments to specific reserves and record provision for loan losses if conditions change regarding collateral values or cash flow expectations. Management anticipates the Bank will need to record provision expense in 2018 due to expected growth and a normalized historical charge-off rate.\nActual net loan charge-offs were $1,499,000 in 2017 and $1,238,000 in 2016. Net charge-offs as a percentage of loans held for investment totaled .24% and .21% in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Dealer Finance Division's charge-off percentage is the largest category at .11% of loans held for investment and land development was .09%. As stated in the most recently available Uniform Bank Performance Report (UPBR), peer group loss averages were .10% in 2017 and .11% in 2016. The Bank anticipates losses will remain above peer due to the Dealer Finance Division, however these losses have been in line with expectations and are more than offset by the increased yield derived from this portfolio.\nBalance Sheet\nTotal assets increased 1.13% during the year to $753,270,000, an increase of $8,381,000 from $744,889,000 in 2016. Loans held for investment grew $25,338,000, Bank premises and equipment increased $5,554,000, whereas loans held for sale decreased $22,960,000 and other asset categories experienced modest fluctuations. Average earning assets increased 1.47% or $9,720,000 to $669,267,000 at December 31, 2017. The increase in earning assets is due largely to the growth in the loans held for investment offset by the decrease in short-term loan participation program with Northpointe Bank. Deposits grew $32,092,000 and other liabilities decreased $28,304,000 in 2017. Average interest bearing deposits increased $20,955,000 for 2017 or 5.60%, with increases in both interest-bearing demand accounts and savings accounts. There was a slight decrease in the time deposit category. The Company continues to utilize its assets well, with 89.95% of average assets consisting of earning assets.\nPART II, Continued\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nInvestment Securities\nTotal securities increased $1,768,000 or 4.48% in 2017 to $41,243,000 at December 31, 2017 from $39,475,000 at December 31, 2016. Average balances in investment securities decreased 30.48% in 2017 to $11,011,000. At year end, 1.65% of average earning assets of the Company were held as investment securities, all of which are unpledged. Management strives to match the types and maturities of securities owned to balance projected liquidity needs, interest rate sensitivity and to maximize earnings through a portfolio bearing low credit risk. Portfolio yields averaged 3.07% for 2017, up from 2.37% in 2016.\nThere were no Other Than Temporary Impairments (OTTI) write-downs in 2017, 2016 or 2015. In 2017, the Company recognized a $42,000 loss on exit of the Banker's Title investment; there were no security gains or losses in 2016 or 2015.\nThe composition of securities at December 31 was:\n\nAt estimated fair value. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for amortized cost.\nIssued by a U.S. Government Agency or secured by U.S. Government Agency collateral.\nMaturities and weighted average yields of securities at December 31, 2017 are presented in the table below. Amounts are shown by contractual maturity; expected maturities will differ as issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations. Maturities of other investments are not readily determinable due to the nature of the investment; see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of these investments.\n\nPART II, Continued\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nAnalysis of Loan Portfolio\nThe Company's market area has a relatively stable economy which tends to be less cyclical than the national economy. Major industries in the market area include agricultural production and processing, higher education, retail sales, services and light manufacturing.\nThe Company's portfolio of loans held for investment totaled $616,974,000 at December 31, 2017 compared with $591,636,000 at the beginning of the year. The Company's policy has been to make conservative loans that are held for future interest income, utilizing prudent underwriting and a strong loan review program. Collateral required by the Company is determined on an individual basis depending on the purpose of the loan and the financial condition of the borrower. Commercial loans, including agricultural and multifamily loans, increased 3.89% during 2017 to $209,721,000. Real estate mortgages increased $12,260,000 or 5.14%. Growth has included a variety of loan and collateral types including owner occupied residential real estate and residential rental properties. Construction loans decreased $4,552,000 or 5.98%. The Bank also has loan participation arrangements with several other banks within the region to aid in diversification of the loan portfolio geographically, by collateral type and by borrower.\nConsumer installment loans increased $9,411,000 or 13.06%. This category includes personal loans, auto loans and other loans to individuals. This category began increasing during the fourth quarter of 2012 due to the opening of the Dealer Finance Division in Penn Laird, Virginia; at year end this Division had a loan portfolio of $75,169,000. Credit card balances increased $117,000 to $2,939,000 but are a minor component of the loan portfolio. The following table presents the changes in the loan portfolio over the previous five years.\n\nThe following table shows the Company's loan maturity and interest rate sensitivity as of December 31, 2017:\n\nPART II, Continued\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nAnalysis of Loan Portfolio, continued\nResidential real estate loans are generally made for a period not to exceed 25 years and are secured by a first deed of trust which normally does not exceed 90% of the appraised value. If the loan to value ratio exceeds 90%, the Company requires additional collateral, guarantees or mortgage insurance. On approximately 94% of the real estate loans, interest is adjustable after each one, three or five-year period. The remainder of the portfolio is comprised of fixed rate loans that are generally made for a fifteen-year or a twenty-year period with an interest rate adjustment after ten years.\nSince 1992, fixed rate real estate loans have been funded with fixed rate borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank, which allows the Company to control its interest rate risk. In addition, the Company makes home equity loans secured by second deeds of trust with total indebtedness not to exceed 90% of the appraised value. Home equity loans are made for three, five or ten year periods at a fixed rate or as a revolving line of credit.\nConstruction loans may be made to individuals, who have arranged with a contractor for the construction of a residence, or to contractors that are involved in building pre-sold, spec-homes or subdivisions. The majority of commercial loans are made to small retail, manufacturing and service businesses. Consumer loans are made for a variety of reasons; however, approximately 74% of the loans are secured by automobiles and trucks.\nApproximately 80% of the Company's loans are secured by real estate; however, policies relating to appraisals and loan to value ratios are adequate to control the related risk. Market values appear to have rebounded from the recession with modest increases in 2015, 2016, and 2017. Unemployment rates in the Company's market area continue to be below both the national and state averages.\nThe Bank has not identified any loan categories that would be considered loan concentrations of greater than 25% of capital. While the Bank has not developed a formal policy limiting the concentration level to any particular loan type or industry segment, it has established target limits on both a nominal and percentage of capital basis. Concentrations are monitored and reported to the board of directors quarterly. Concentration levels have been used by management to determine how aggressively we may price or pursue new loan requests. At December 31, 2017, there are no industry categories of loans that exceed 10% of total loans.\nNonaccrual and Past Due Loans\nNonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans and loans 90 days or more past due. Nonaccrual loans are loans on which interest accruals have been suspended or discontinued permanently. The Company would have earned approximately $102,000 in additional interest income had the loans on nonaccrual status been current and performing. Nonperforming loans totaled $7,102,000 at December 31, 2017 compared to $4,870,000 at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, $198,000 of loans 90 days or more past due were not on nonaccrual status. Approximately 88% of these nonperforming loans are secured by real estate. Although management expects that there may be additional loan losses, the Bank believes that it is generally well secured and continues to actively work with its customers to effect payment. As of December 31, 2017, the Company holds $1,984,000 of real estate which was acquired through foreclosure.\nNonperforming loans have increased approximately $2,232,000 since December 31, 2016. Of the increase, $1.5 million relates to two borrowers; one of which has sold equipment and the loan will be modified for collection of the remaining balance, with no loss anticipated as of December 31, 2017. The other relationship is in the process of subdividing property to sell in order to bring the loan current; this loan has been reviewed for impairment and has a specific reserve of $249,000 in our allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2017.\nPART II, Continued\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nNonaccrual and Past Due Loans, continued\nThe following is a summary of information pertaining to nonperforming loans:\n\nPotential Problem Loans\nLoans classified for regulatory purposes as loss, doubtful, substandard, or special mention do not represent or result from trends or uncertainties which management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results, liquidity or capital resources. Nor do they represent material credits about which management is aware of any information which causes it to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the loan repayment terms. As of December 31, 2017, management is not aware of any potential problem loans which are not already classified for regulatory purposes or on the watch list as part of the Bank's internal grading system.\nPART II, Continued\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nLoan Losses and the Allowance for Loan Losses\nIn evaluating the portfolio, loans are segregated into loans with identified potential losses, pools of loans by type, with separate weighting for past dues and adverse rated loans, and a general allowance based on a variety of criteria. Loans with identified potential losses include examiner and bank classified loans. Classified relationships in excess of $500,000 and loans identified as troubled debt restructurings are reviewed individually for impairment under ASC 310. A variety of factors are considered when reviewing these credits, including borrower cash flow, payment history, fair value of collateral, company management, industry and economic factors.\nLoans that are not impaired are categorized by call report code into unimpaired and classified loans. For unimpaired loans an estimate is calculated based on actual loss experience over the last five years, for loans of that type. During 2015, the Company felt the two-year loss history utilized in 2014 and prior would not be indicative of the amount of losses that could occur in our current economic cycle, therefore the loss history was expanded to five years to capture a more representative loss history. Dealer finance loans utilize a two-year loss history. The Company monitors the net losses for this division and adjusts based on how the portfolio performs since the department was established in 2012. For classified loans, loans are grouped by call code and past due or adverse risk rating. Loss rates are assigned based on actual loss experience over the last five years multiplied by a risk factor. The Dealer finance loans are given a higher risk factor for past due and adverse risk ratings based on back testing of the risk factors.\nA general allowance for inherent losses has been established to reflect other unidentified losses within the portfolio. The general allowance is calculated using nine qualitative factors identified in the 2006 Interagency Policy Statement on the allowance for loan losses. The general allowance assists in managing recent changes in portfolio risk that may not be captured in individually impaired loans, or in the homogeneous pools based on loss histories. The Board approves the loan loss provision for each quarter based on this evaluation.\nThe allowance for loan losses of $6,044,000 at December 31, 2017 is equal to .98% of total loans held for investment. This compares to an allowance of $7,543,000 or 1.27% at December 31, 2016 and 1.61% at December 31, 2015. Management and the Board of Directors feel that the current reserve level is adequate based on the analysis of historical losses, delinquency rates, collateral values of delinquent loans and a thorough review of the loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans has decreased from 154.89% to 85.10% in 2017; increases in the nonperforming loans have been analyzed and, where necessary, a specific reserve has been recorded. In addition, past due and adversely risk rated loans have higher allocation factors within the allowance for loan losses calculation. The Company has experienced a continued decline in historical charge-off rates with 2017 replacing 2012 in the five-year lookback and the local economy showing continued improvements in unemployment. Management will continue to monitor relationships that have recently become past due but are not considered impaired at this time.\nLoan losses, net of recoveries, totaled $1,499,000 in 2017 which is equivalent to .24% of total loans outstanding. Over the preceding three years, the Company has had an average loss rate of .16%, compared to a .11% loss rate for its peer group.\nPART II, Continued\nItem 7.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nLoan Losses and the Allowance for Loan Losses, continued\n\nDeposits and Borrowings\nThe average deposit balances and average rates paid for 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nAverage Deposits and Rates Paid (Dollars in thousands)\n\nAverage noninterest-bearing demand deposits, which are comprised of checking accounts, increased $12,460,000 or 8.83% from $141,180,000 during 2016 to $153,640,000 during 2017. Average interest-bearing deposits, which include interest checking accounts, money market accounts, regular savings accounts and time deposits, increased $20,955,000 or 5.60% from $374,044,000 at December 31, 2016 to $394,999,000 at December 31, 2017. Total average interest checking (including money market) account balances increased $7,570,000 or 6.67% from $113,525,000 at December 31, 2016 to $121,095,000 at December 31, 2017. Total average savings and money market account balances increased $14,191,000 or 14.15% from $100,298,000 at December 31, 2016 to $114,489,000 at December 31, 2017.\nAverage time deposits decreased $806,000 or .50% from $160,221,000 at December 31, 2016 to $159,415,000 at December 31, 2017.\nPART II, Continued\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nDeposits and Borrowings, continued\nThe maturity distribution of certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more is as follows:\n\nNon-deposit borrowings include federal funds purchased and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings, (both short term and long term). Non-deposit borrowings are an important source of funding for the Bank. These sources assist in managing short and long-term funding needs, often at rates that are more favorable than raising additional funds within the deposit portfolio.\nBorrowings from the FHLB are used to support the Bank's lending program and allow the Bank to manage interest rate risk by laddering maturities", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion provides information about the major components of the results of operations and financial condition, liquidity and capital resources of F & M Bank Corp. and its subsidiaries. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements presented in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Information, of this Form 10-K.\nLending Activities\nCredit Policies\nThe principal risk associated with each of the categories of loans in our portfolio is the creditworthiness of our borrowers. Within each category, such risk is increased or decreased, depending on prevailing economic conditions. In an effort to manage the risk, our loan policy gives loan amount approval limits to individual loan officers based on their position and level of experience and to our loan committees based on the size of the lending relationship. The risk associated with real estate and construction loans, commercial loans and consumer loans varies, based on market employment levels, consumer confidence, fluctuations in the value of real estate and other conditions that affect the ability of borrowers to repay indebtedness. The risk associated with real estate construction loans varies, based on the supply and demand for the type of real estate under construction.\nWe have written policies and procedures to help manage credit risk. We have a loan review policy that includes regular portfolio reviews to establish loss exposure and to ascertain compliance with our loan policy.\nWe use a management loan committee and a directors' loan committee to approve loans. The management loan committee is comprised of members of senior management, and the directors' loan committee is comprised of any six directors. Both committees approve new, renewed and or modified loans that exceed officer loan authorities. The directors' loan committee also reviews any changes to our lending policies, which are then approved by our board of directors.\nConstruction and Development Lending\nWe make construction loans, primarily residential, and land acquisition and development loans. The construction loans are secured by residential houses under construction and the underlying land for which the loan was obtained. The average life of a construction loan is approximately 12 months, and it is typically re-priced as the prime rate of interest changes. The majority of the interest rates charged on these loans float with the market. Construction lending entails significant additional risks, compared with residential mortgage lending. Construction loans often involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Another risk involved in construction lending is attributable to the fact that loan funds are advanced upon the security of the land or home under construction, which value is estimated prior to the completion of construction. Thus, it is more difficult to evaluate accurately the total loan funds required to complete a project and related loan-to-value ratios. To mitigate the risks associated with construction lending, we generally limit loan amounts to 75% to 90% of appraised value, in addition to analyzing the creditworthiness of our borrowers. We also obtain a first lien on the property as security for our construction loans and typically require personal guarantees from the borrower's principal owners.\nPART II, continued\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nCommercial Real Estate Lending\nCommercial real estate loans are secured by various types of commercial real estate in our market area, including multi-family residential buildings, commercial buildings and offices, shopping centers and churches. Commercial real estate lending entails significant additional risks, compared with residential mortgage lending. Commercial real estate loans typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Additionally, the payment experience on loans secured by income producing properties is typically dependent on the successful operation of a business or a real estate project and thus may be subject, to a greater extent, to adverse conditions in the real estate market or in the economy in general. Our commercial real estate loan underwriting criteria require an examination of debt service coverage ratios and the borrower's creditworthiness, prior credit history and reputation. We also evaluate the location of the security property and typically require personal guarantees or endorsements of the borrower's principal owners.\nBusiness Lending\nBusiness loans generally have a higher degree of risk than residential mortgage loans but have higher yields. To manage these risks, we generally obtain appropriate collateral and personal guarantees from the borrower's principal owners and monitor the financial condition of our business borrowers. Residential mortgage loans generally are made on the basis of the borrower's ability to make repayment from employment and other income and are secured by real estate whose value tends to be readily ascertainable. In contrast, business loans typically are made on the basis of the borrower's ability to make repayment from cash flow from its business and are secured by business assets, such as real estate, accounts receivable, equipment and inventory. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of business loans is substantially dependent on the success of the business itself. Furthermore, the collateral for business loans may depreciate over time and generally cannot be appraised with as much precision as residential real estate.\nConsumer Lending\nWe offer various consumer loans, including personal loans and lines of credit, automobile loans, deposit account loans, installment and demand loans, and home equity lines of credit and loans. Such loans are generally made to clients with whom we have a pre-existing relationship. We currently originate all of our consumer loans in our geographic market area.\nThe underwriting standards employed by us for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant's payment history on other debts and an assessment of their ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. The stability of the applicant's monthly income may be determined by verification of gross monthly income from primary employment and additionally from any verifiable secondary income. Although creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes an analysis of the value of the security in relation to the proposed loan amount. For home equity lines of credit and loans we require title insurance, hazard insurance and, if required, flood insurance.\nResidential Mortgage Lending\nThe Bank makes residential mortgage loans for the purchase or refinance of existing loans with loan to value limits ranging between 80 and 90% depending on the age of the property, borrower's income and credit worthiness. Loans that are retained in our portfolio generally carry adjustable rates that can change every three to five years, based on amortization periods of twenty to thirty years.\nPART II, continued\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nLoans Held for Sale\nThe Bank makes fixed rate mortgage loans with terms of typically fifteen or thirty years through its subsidiary VBS Mortgage. These loans are funded by VBS utilizing a line of credit at the Bank until sold to investors in the secondary market. Similarly, the Bank also has a relationship with Northpointe Bank in Grand Rapids, MI whereby it purchases fixed rate conforming 1-4 family mortgage loans for short periods of time pending those loans being sold to investors in the secondary market. These loans have an average duration of ten days to two weeks, but occasionally remain on the Bank's books for up to 60 days. The Bank began its relationship with Northpointe Bank in 2014 and had a similar program with a prior bank since 2003. This relationship allows the Bank to achieve a higher rate of return than is available on other short term investment opportunities.\nDealer Finance Division\nIn September 2012, the Bank started a loan production office in Penn Laird, VA which specializes in providing automobile financing through a network of automobile dealers. The Dealer Finance Division was originally staffed with three officers that have extensive experience in Dealer Finance. Based on the strong growth of this division the staff has been increased to six employees. This office is serving the automobile finance needs for customers of dealers throughout the existing geographic footprint of the Bank. Approximately fifty dealers have signed contracts to originate loans on behalf of the Bank. As of year end 2017, the division had total loans outstanding of $75.2 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nGeneral\nThe Company's financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The financial information contained within the statements is, to a significant extent, financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. The Company's financial position and results of operations are affected by management's application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues, expenses and related disclosures. Different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the Company's consolidated financial position and/or results of operations.\nIn addition, GAAP itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method. Although the economics of these transactions would be the same, the timing of events that would impact these transactions could change. Following is a summary of the Company's significant accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates, assumptions and judgments.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in the loan portfolio. The allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting: (i) ASC 450 (formerly SFAS No. 5) Contingencies\u201d, which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable and (ii) ASC 310 (formerly SFAS No. 114), Receivables\u201d, which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral, present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance. The Company's allowance for loan losses is the accumulation of various components that are calculated based on independent methodologies. All components of the allowance represent an estimation performed pursuant to either ASC 450 or ASC 310. Management's estimate of each ASC 450 component is based on certain observable data that management believes are most reflective of the underlying credit losses being estimated. This evaluation includes credit quality trends; collateral values; loan volumes; geographic, borrower and industry concentrations; seasoning of the loan portfolio; the findings of internal credit quality assessments and results from external bank regulatory examinations. These factors, as well as historical losses and current economic and business conditions, are used in developing estimated loss factors used in the calculations.\nPART II, continued\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\nAllowance for Loan Losses, continued\nAllowances for loans are determined by applying estimated loss factors to the portfolio based on management's evaluation and risk grading\u201d of the loan portfolio. Specific allowances are typically provided on all impaired loans in excess of a defined loan size threshold that are classified in the Substandard or Doubtful risk grades. The specific reserves are determined on a loan-by-loan basis based on management's evaluation of the Company's exposure for each credit, given the current payment status of the loan and the value of any underlying collateral.\nWhile management uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan and lease losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the valuations or, if required by regulators, based upon information available to them at the time of their examinations. Such adjustments to original estimates, as necessary, are made in the period in which these factors and other relevant considerations indicate that loss levels may vary from previous estimates.\nGoodwill and Intangibles\nIn June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASC 805, Business Combinations and ASC 350, Intangibles. The provisions of ASC 350 discontinue and amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Instead, these assets are subject to an annual impairment review and more frequently if certain impairment indicators are in evidence. ASC 350 also requires that reporting units be identified for the purpose of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill.\nThe Company adopted ASC 350 on January 1, 2002. Goodwill totaled $2,639,000 at January 1, 2002. As of December 31, 2008, the Company recognized $31,000 in additional goodwill related to the purchase of 70% ownership in VBS Mortgage. In 2017 the Company recognized $211,000 in goodwill and $285,000 in intangibles related to the purchase of 76% ownership in VST. The goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually. Based on this testing, there were no impairment charges for 2017, 2016 or 2015. The Intangibles related to the VST purchase are amortized over periods up to 15 years with $53,000 recorded in 2017.\nIncome Tax\nThe determination of income taxes represents results in income and expense being recognized in different periods for financial reporting purposes versus for the purpose of computing income taxes currently payable. Deferred taxes are provided on such temporary differences and are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled. Further, the Company seeks strategies that minimize the tax effect of implementing its business strategies. Management makes judgments regarding the ultimate consequence of long-term tax planning strategies, including the likelihood of future recognition of deferred tax benefits. As a result, it is considered a significant estimate.\nPART II, continued\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\nFair Value\nThe estimate of fair value involves the use of (1) quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets, (2) quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques using significant assumptions that are observable in the market or (3) model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. When observable market prices and parameters are not fully available, management's judgment is necessary to arrive at fair value including estimates of current market participant expectations of future cash flows, risk premiums, among other things. Additionally, significant judgment may be required to determine whether certain assets measured at fair value are classified within the fair value hierarchy as Level 2 or Level 3. The estimation process and the potential materiality of the amounts involved result in this item being identified as critical.\nPension Plan Accounting\nThe accounting guidance for the measurement and recognition of obligations and expense related to pension plans generally applies the concept that the cost of benefits provided during retirement should be recognized over the employees' active working life. Inherent in this concept is the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date. Major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of benefits expense and accumulated obligation include discount rates, expected return on assets, mortality rates, and projected salary increases, among others. Changes in assumptions or judgments related to any of these variables could result in significant volatility in the Company's financial condition and results of operations. As a result, accounting for the Company's pension expense and obligation is considered a significant estimate. The estimation process and the potential materiality of the amounts involved result in this item being identified as critical.\nOther Real Estate Owned (OREO)\nOREO is held for sale and represents real estate acquired through or in lieu of foreclosure. OREO is initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. Physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan occurs when legal title is obtained upon completion of foreclosure or when the borrower conveys all interest in the property to satisfy the loan through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a similar legal agreement. The Company's policy is to carry OREO on its balance sheet at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. If fair value declines subsequent to foreclosure, a valuation allowance is recorded through expense. Operating costs after acquisition are expensed.\nPART II, continued\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\nOverview\nThe Company's net income for 2017 totaled $9,010,000 or $2.63 per common share, a decrease of 5.83% from $9,568,000 or $2.77 a share in 2016. Return on average equity decreased in 2017 to 10.01% versus 11.18% in 2016, and the return on average assets decreased from 1.34% in 2016 to 1.21% in 2017. These results reflect an $811,000 tax adjustment due to the write down of deferred tax assets as a result of the change in federal corporate income tax rate from 34% to 21% with the passing of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act.\nSee page 19 for a five-year summary of selected financial data.\nChanges in Net Income per Common Share (Basic)\nTable 11: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nto 2016\n</td> <td>\nto 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Prior Year Net Income Per Common Share (Basic)\n</td> <td> $2.77\n</td> <td> $2.40\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change from differences in:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income\n</td> <td> .52\n</td> <td> .62\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for loan losses\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> .09\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest income, excluding securities gains\n</td> <td> 1.36\n</td> <td> (.08)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Security gains (losses), net\n</td> <td> (.01)\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest expenses1\n</td> <td> (1.66)\n</td> <td> (.40)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income taxes\n</td> <td> (.38)\n</td> <td> .12\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of preferred stock dividend\n</td> <td> .02\n</td> <td> .01\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in average shares outstanding\n</td> <td> .01\n</td> <td> .01\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Change\n</td> <td> (.14)\n</td> <td> .37\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income Per Common Share (Basic)\n</td> <td> $2.63\n</td> <td> $2.77\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n1Noninterest income and noninterest expense reflect the reclassification of VBS to record gross income/expense rather than net.\nNet Interest Income\nThe largest source of operating revenue for the Company is net interest income, which is calculated as the difference between the interest earned on earning assets and the interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities. Net interest income increased 5.78% from 2016 to 2017 following an increase of 7.60% from 2015 to 2016. The net interest margin is the net interest income expressed as a percentage of interest earning assets. Changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, along with their yields and rates, have a significant impact on the level of net interest income. Tax equivalent net interest income for 2017 was $30,342,000 representing an increase of $1,714,000 or 5.99% over the prior year. A 7.60% increase in 2016 versus 2015 resulted in total tax equivalent net interest income of $28,683,000.\nIn this discussion and in the tabular analysis of net interest income performance, entitled Consolidated Average Balances, Yields and Rates,\u201d (found on page 26), the interest earned on tax exempt loans and investment securities has been adjusted to reflect the amount that would have been earned had these investments been subject to normal income taxation. This is referred to as tax equivalent net interest income. For a reconciliation of tax equivalent net interest income to GAAP measures, see the table on page 40.\nTax equivalent income on earning assets increased $2,012,000 in 2017 compared to 2016. Loans held for investment, expressed as a percentage of total earning assets, increased in 2017 to 90.29% as compared to 86.02% in 2016. During 2017, yields on earning assets increased 23 basis points (BP), primarily due to rate increases during 2017 specifically in commercial loans, investments and federal funds sold. The average cost of interest bearing liabilities increased 6BP in 2017, following an increase of 9BP in 2016. The increase in 2017 in due to increased cost of deposits and debt as rates increased.\nThe analysis on the next page reveals an increase in the net interest margin to 4.53% in 2017 from 4.34% in 2016, primarily due to changes in balance sheet leverage and increased interest rates during the year.\nPART II, Continued\nItem 7.

Average real estate loans increased 5.89%, commercial loans increased 3.55% and consumer installment loans increased 15.62% on average. The increase in average consumer loans is a result of the growth in our Dealer Finance Division which opened at the end of 2012. The increase in tax equivalent interest income is primarily due to the growth in the loan portfolio, with commercial loans contributing the most interest income growth.\nPART II, Continued\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nThe following table provides detail on the components of tax equivalent net interest income:\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td>\nGAAP Financial Measurements:\n(Dollars in thousands).\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest Income - Loans\n</td> <td> $33,591\n</td> <td> $31,740\n</td> <td> $29,056\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest Income - Securities and Other Interest-Earnings Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest Expense - Deposits\n</td> <td> 2,688\n</td> <td> 2,380\n</td> <td> 2,153\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest Expense - Other Borrowings\n</td> <td> 1,209\n</td> <td> 1,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Net Interest Income\n</td> <td> 30,198\n</td> <td> 28,551\n</td> <td> 26,528\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-GAAP Financial Measurements:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add: Tax Benefit on Tax-Exempt Interest Income - Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add: Tax Benefit on Tax-Exempt Interest Income - Securities and Other Interest-Earnings Assets\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Tax Benefit on Tax-Exempt Interest Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tax-Equivalent Net Interest Income\n</td> <td> $30,342\n</td> <td> $28,683\n</td> <td> $26,658\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $298,000 or 8.28% during 2017, which followed a 25.14% increase or $723,000 in 2016. The average cost of funds of .83% increased .06% compared to 2016, which followed an increase of .09% in 2016 compared to 2015. Average interest bearing liabilities increased $388,000 in 2017 following an increase of $43,486,000 in 2016. The average interest bearing liabilities have remained flat in 2017 and increased 10.24% in 2016. Changes in the cost of funds attributable to rate and volume variances can be found in the table at the top of page 27.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income continues to be an increasingly important factor in maintaining and growing profitability. Management is conscious of the need to constantly review fee income and develop additional sources of complementary revenue. During 2017, VBS Mortgage's income was reclassified to report gross income and gross expenses in the appropriate income statement categories rather than netting in noninterest income, 2016 and 2015 income statements were reclassified to be comparative.\nNoninterest income, exclusive of security gains or losses, increased 42.14% or $2,352,000, in 2017 following an increase of 16.46% in 2016. The increase is due to the addition of VST Title, increases in VBS Mortgage gross revenue and service charges on deposit account. In addition, the FHLB prepayment gain of $504,000 is recorded in noninterest income. The losses on low income housing projects decreased 14.5% for 2017 due to recognition of $162,000 in gains related to a fund that was dissolved. The 2016 increase over 2015 was primarily due to record earnings at VBS Mortgage.\nThe Company reported an investment loss related to both the Bank and VBS exiting the Bankers Title investment in 2017. The total loss was $42,000. There were no security transactions in 2016 or 2015 which resulted in a gain or loss.\nPART II, Continued\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expenses increased from $21,272,000 in 2016 to $24,719,000 in 2017, a 16.20% increase. Salary and benefits increased 16.05% to $14,854,000 in 2017 following an increase of 11.72% in 2016. This increase was the result of normal salary increases, additions to staff for new branches, the addition of VS Title (in 2017) and administrative positions as well as increasing benefit costs (including health care cost, pension expense and profit sharing expenses). Occupancy and Equipment expenses increased $268,000 or 16.72% due to the growth in our branch network following an increase of 5.74% in 2016. Other operating expenses increased $1,125,000 in 2017, following a $288,000 increase in 2016. The primary increases were in the areas of information technology ($211,000), credit and debit card related services ($114,000), contributions ($266,000), and VBS and VST other operating expense growth ($101,000). The 2016 primary increases were in advertising and employee appreciation ($70,000), other loan related costs ($127,000), legal and professional expense ($108,000) and checking account program expenses ($257,000). Total noninterest expense as a percentage of average assets totaled 3.32%, 2.98%, and 3.04%, in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. With the growth in branches, addition of VST and increased staff at VBS mortgage noninterest expenses have shown increase relative to peer data. Peer group averages (as reported in the most recent Uniform Bank Performance Report) have ranged between 2.80%, 2.84% and 2.86% over the same time period.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nManagement evaluates the loan portfolio in light of national and local economic trends, changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and industry standards. Specific factors considered by management in determining the adequacy of the level of the allowance for loan losses include internally generated loan review reports, past due reports and historical loan loss experience. This review also considers concentrations of loans in terms of geography, business type and level of risk. Management evaluates nonperforming loans relative to their collateral value, when deemed collateral dependent, and makes the appropriate adjustments to the allowance for loan losses when needed. Based on the factors outlined above, the current year provision for loan losses remained at $0 as in 2016. The current levels of the allowance for loan losses reflect increased net charge-off activity, loan growth, and other credit risk factors that the Company considers in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. The Company has experienced an increase in past due loans and nonperforming loans at year end; the nonperforming loans increase can be attributed to one borrower ($1.1 million) that has a specific reserve in the allowance for loan losses; the past due loan increase is primarily attributed to one borrower ($5.9 million) that is being closely monitored. Management is in the process of restructuring the relationship and has determined that there is no impairment at this time. Management will continue to monitor nonperforming and past due loans and will make necessary adjustments to specific reserves and record provision for loan losses if conditions change regarding collateral values or cash flow expectations. Management anticipates the Bank will need to record provision expense in 2018 due to expected growth and a normalized historical charge-off rate.\nActual net loan charge-offs were $1,499,000 in 2017 and $1,238,000 in 2016. Net charge-offs as a percentage of loans held for investment totaled .24% and .21% in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Dealer Finance Division's charge-off percentage is the largest category at .11% of loans held for investment and land development was .09%. As stated in the most recently available Uniform Bank Performance Report (UPBR), peer group loss averages were .10% in 2017 and .11% in 2016. The Bank anticipates losses will remain above peer due to the Dealer Finance Division, however these losses have been in line with expectations and are more than offset by the increased yield derived from this portfolio.\nBalance Sheet\nTotal assets increased 1.13% during the year to $753,270,000, an increase of $8,381,000 from $744,889,000 in 2016. Loans held for investment grew $25,338,000, Bank premises and equipment increased $5,554,000, whereas loans held for sale decreased $22,960,000 and other asset categories experienced modest fluctuations. Average earning assets increased 1.47% or $9,720,000 to $669,267,000 at December 31, 2017. The increase in earning assets is due largely to the growth in the loans held for investment offset by the decrease in short-term loan participation program with Northpointe Bank. Deposits grew $32,092,000 and other liabilities decreased $28,304,000 in 2017. Average interest bearing deposits increased $20,955,000 for 2017 or 5.60%, with increases in both interest-bearing demand accounts and savings accounts. There was a slight decrease in the time deposit category. The Company continues to utilize its assets well, with 89.95% of average assets consisting of earning assets.\nPART II, Continued\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nInvestment Securities\nTotal securities increased $1,768,000 or 4.48% in 2017 to $41,243,000 at December 31, 2017 from $39,475,000 at December 31, 2016. Average balances in investment securities decreased 30.48% in 2017 to $11,011,000. At year end, 1.65% of average earning assets of the Company were held as investment securities, all of which are unpledged. Management strives to match the types and maturities of securities owned to balance projected liquidity needs, interest rate sensitivity and to maximize earnings through a portfolio bearing low credit risk. Portfolio yields averaged 3.07% for 2017, up from 2.37% in 2016.\nThere were no Other Than Temporary Impairments (OTTI) write-downs in 2017, 2016 or 2015. In 2017, the Company recognized a $42,000 loss on exit of the Banker's Title investment; there were no security gains or losses in 2016 or 2015.\nThe composition of securities at December 31 was:\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Available for Sale1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. Treasury and Agency\n</td> <td> $27,978\n</td> <td> $24,014\n</td> <td> $12,095\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage-backed obligations of federal agencies2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> 28,615\n</td> <td> 24,783\n</td> <td> 13,047\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Held to Maturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. Treasury and Agency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Equity Investments\n</td> <td> 12,503\n</td> <td> 14,567\n</td> <td> 12,157\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Securities\n</td> <td> $41,243\n</td> <td> $39,475\n</td> <td> $25,329\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt estimated fair value.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nAnalysis of Loan Portfolio\nThe Company's market area has a relatively stable economy which tends to be less cyclical than the national economy. Major industries in the market area include agricultural production and processing, higher education, retail sales, services and light manufacturing.\nThe Company's portfolio of loans held for investment totaled $616,974,000 at December 31, 2017 compared with $591,636,000 at the beginning of the year. The Company's policy has been to make conservative loans that are held for future interest income, utilizing prudent underwriting and a strong loan review program. Collateral required by the Company is determined on an individual basis depending on the purpose of the loan and the financial condition of the borrower. Commercial loans, including agricultural and multifamily loans, increased 3.89% during 2017 to $209,721,000. Real estate mortgages increased $12,260,000 or 5.14%. Growth has included a variety of loan and collateral types including owner occupied residential real estate and residential rental properties. Construction loans decreased $4,552,000 or 5.98%. The Bank also has loan participation arrangements with several other banks within the region to aid in diversification of the loan portfolio geographically, by collateral type and by borrower.\nConsumer installment loans increased $9,411,000 or 13.06%. This category includes personal loans, auto loans and other loans to individuals. This category began increasing during the fourth quarter of 2012 due to the opening of the Dealer Finance Division in Penn Laird, Virginia; at year end this Division had a loan portfolio of $75,169,000. Credit card balances increased $117,000 to $2,939,000 but are a minor component of the loan portfolio. The following table presents the changes in the loan portfolio over the previous five years.\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate - mortgage\n</td> <td> $250,891\n</td> <td> $238,631\n</td> <td> $232,321\n</td> <td> $223,824\n</td> <td> $212,630\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate - construction\n</td> <td> 71,620\n</td> <td> 76,172\n</td> <td> 69,759\n</td> <td> 67,180\n</td> <td> 68,512\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer installment\n</td> <td> 81,458\n</td> <td> 72,048\n</td> <td> 62,239\n</td> <td> 49,615\n</td> <td> 30,643\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial\n</td> <td> 182,360\n</td> <td> 178,392\n</td> <td> 153,691\n</td> <td> 147,599\n</td> <td> 135,835\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Agricultural\n</td> <td> 17,064\n</td> <td> 15,876\n</td> <td> 15,672\n</td> <td> 15,374\n</td> <td> 16,265\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Multi-family residential\n</td> <td> 10,298\n</td> <td> 7,605\n</td> <td> 7,559\n</td> <td> 11,775\n</td> <td> 11,797\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit cards\n</td> <td> 2,939\n</td> <td> 2,822\n</td> <td> 2,745\n</td> <td> 2,705\n</td> <td> 2,680\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Loans\n</td> <td> $616,974\n</td> <td> $591,636\n</td> <td> $544,053\n</td> <td> $518,202\n</td> <td> $478,453\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table shows the Company's loan maturity and interest rate sensitivity as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Less Than\n</td> <td> 1-5\n</td> <td>\nOver\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\nYear\n</td> <td>\nYears\n</td> <td>\nYears\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial and\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> agricultural loans\n</td> <td> $66,586\n</td> <td> $106,048\n</td> <td> $26,790\n</td> <td> $199,424\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Multi-family residential\n</td> <td> 4,628\n</td> <td> 5,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,298\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real Estate - mortgage\n</td> <td> 104,699\n</td> <td> 141,572\n</td> <td> 4,620\n</td> <td> 250,891\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real Estate - construction\n</td> <td> 50,857\n</td> <td> 18,637\n</td> <td> 2,126\n</td> <td> 71,620\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer - installment/credit cards/other\n</td> <td> 9,027\n</td> <td> 61,600\n</td> <td> 14,114\n</td> <td> 84,741\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> $235,797\n</td> <td> $333,030\n</td> <td> $48,147\n</td> <td> $616,974\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans with predetermined rates\n</td> <td> $28,101\n</td> <td> $79,748\n</td> <td> $30,378\n</td> <td> $138,227\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans with variable or\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> adjustable rates\n</td> <td> 207,696\n</td> <td> 253,282\n</td> <td> 17,769\n</td> <td> 478,747\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> $235,797\n</td> <td> $333,030\n</td> <td> $48,147\n</td> <td> $616,974\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPART II, Continued\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nAnalysis of Loan Portfolio, continued\nResidential real estate loans are generally made for a period not to exceed 25 years and are secured by a first deed of trust which normally does not exceed 90% of the appraised value. If the loan to value ratio exceeds 90%, the Company requires additional collateral, guarantees or mortgage insurance. On approximately 94% of the real estate loans, interest is adjustable after each one, three or five-year period. The remainder of the portfolio is comprised of fixed rate loans that are generally made for a fifteen-year or a twenty-year period with an interest rate adjustment after ten years.\nSince 1992, fixed rate real estate loans have been funded with fixed rate borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank, which allows the Company to control its interest rate risk. In addition, the Company makes home equity loans secured by second deeds of trust with total indebtedness not to exceed 90% of the appraised value. Home equity loans are made for three, five or ten year periods at a fixed rate or as a revolving line of credit.\nConstruction loans may be made to individuals, who have arranged with a contractor for the construction of a residence, or to contractors that are involved in building pre-sold, spec-homes or subdivisions. The majority of commercial loans are made to small retail, manufacturing and service businesses. Consumer loans are made for a variety of reasons; however, approximately 74% of the loans are secured by automobiles and trucks.\nApproximately 80% of the Company's loans are secured by real estate; however, policies relating to appraisals and loan to value ratios are adequate to control the related risk. Market values appear to have rebounded from the recession with modest increases in 2015, 2016, and 2017. Unemployment rates in the Company's market area continue to be below both the national and state averages.\nThe Bank has not identified any loan categories that would be considered loan concentrations of greater than 25% of capital. While the Bank has not developed a formal policy limiting the concentration level to any particular loan type or industry segment, it has established target limits on both a nominal and percentage of capital basis. Concentrations are monitored and reported to the board of directors quarterly. Concentration levels have been used by management to determine how aggressively we may price or pursue new loan requests. At December 31, 2017, there are no industry categories of loans that exceed 10% of total loans.\nNonaccrual and Past Due Loans\nNonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans and loans 90 days or more past due. Nonaccrual loans are loans on which interest accruals have been suspended or discontinued permanently. The Company would have earned approximately $102,000 in additional interest income had the loans on nonaccrual status been current and performing. Nonperforming loans totaled $7,102,000 at December 31, 2017 compared to $4,870,000 at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, $198,000 of loans 90 days or more past due were not on nonaccrual status. Approximately 88% of these nonperforming loans are secured by real estate. Although management expects that there may be additional loan losses, the Bank believes that it is generally well secured and continues to actively work with its customers to effect payment. As of December 31, 2017, the Company holds $1,984,000 of real estate which was acquired through foreclosure.\nNonperforming loans have increased approximately $2,232,000 since December 31, 2016. Of the increase, $1.5 million relates to two borrowers; one of which has sold equipment and the loan will be modified for collection of the remaining balance, with no loss anticipated as of December 31, 2017. The other relationship is in the process of subdividing property to sell in order to bring the loan current; this loan has been reviewed for impairment and has a specific reserve of $249,000 in our allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2017.\nPART II, Continued\nItem 7.

Nor do they represent material credits about which management is aware of any information which causes it to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the loan repayment terms. As of December 31, 2017, management is not aware of any potential problem loans which are not already classified for regulatory purposes or on the watch list as part of the Bank's internal grading system.\nPART II, Continued\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nLoan Losses and the Allowance for Loan Losses\nIn evaluating the portfolio, loans are segregated into loans with identified potential losses, pools of loans by type, with separate weighting for past dues and adverse rated loans, and a general allowance based on a variety of criteria. Loans with identified potential losses include examiner and bank classified loans. Classified relationships in excess of $500,000 and loans identified as troubled debt restructurings are reviewed individually for impairment under ASC 310. A variety of factors are considered when reviewing these credits, including borrower cash flow, payment history, fair value of collateral, company management, industry and economic factors.\nLoans that are not impaired are categorized by call report code into unimpaired and classified loans. For unimpaired loans an estimate is calculated based on actual loss experience over the last five years, for loans of that type. During 2015, the Company felt the two-year loss history utilized in 2014 and prior would not be indicative of the amount of losses that could occur in our current economic cycle, therefore the loss history was expanded to five years to capture a more representative loss history. Dealer finance loans utilize a two-year loss history. The Company monitors the net losses for this division and adjusts based on how the portfolio performs since the department was established in 2012. For classified loans, loans are grouped by call code and past due or adverse risk rating. Loss rates are assigned based on actual loss experience over the last five years multiplied by a risk factor. The Dealer finance loans are given a higher risk factor for past due and adverse risk ratings based on back testing of the risk factors.\nA general allowance for inherent losses has been established to reflect other unidentified losses within the portfolio. The general allowance is calculated using nine qualitative factors identified in the 2006 Interagency Policy Statement on the allowance for loan losses. The general allowance assists in managing recent changes in portfolio risk that may not be captured in individually impaired loans, or in the homogeneous pools based on loss histories. The Board approves the loan loss provision for each quarter based on this evaluation.\nThe allowance for loan losses of $6,044,000 at December 31, 2017 is equal to .98% of total loans held for investment. This compares to an allowance of $7,543,000 or 1.27% at December 31, 2016 and 1.61% at December 31, 2015. Management and the Board of Directors feel that the current reserve level is adequate based on the analysis of historical losses, delinquency rates, collateral values of delinquent loans and a thorough review of the loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans has decreased from 154.89% to 85.10% in 2017; increases in the nonperforming loans have been analyzed and, where necessary, a specific reserve has been recorded. In addition, past due and adversely risk rated loans have higher allocation factors within the allowance for loan losses calculation. The Company has experienced a continued decline in historical charge-off rates with 2017 replacing 2012 in the five-year lookback and the local economy showing continued improvements in unemployment. Management will continue to monitor relationships that have recently become past due but are not considered impaired at this time.\nLoan losses, net of recoveries, totaled $1,499,000 in 2017 which is equivalent to .24% of total loans outstanding. Over the preceding three years, the Company has had an average loss rate of .16%, compared to a .11% loss rate for its peer group.\nPART II, Continued\nItem 7.
