Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of the Company should be read in conjunction with Item 6, Selected Financial Data,\u201d and our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this Form 10-K\u201d). Certain statements we make under this Item 7 constitute forward-looking statements\u201d under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d preceding Part I of this Form 10-K. You should consider our forward-looking statements in light of our Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC.\nBusiness Objectives and Outlook\nOur objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our investors over the long-term, primarily through dividends and secondarily through capital appreciation. We intend to achieve our objective by originating and acquiring target assets to create a diversified investment portfolio that is financed in a manner that is designed to deliver attractive returns across a variety of market conditions and economic cycles. We are focused on our three core competencies: transaction access, asset analysis and selection, and identification of attractive relative values within the real estate debt and equity markets.\nSince our IPO in August 2009, we have evolved from a company focused on opportunistic acquisitions of real estate debt assets from distressed sellers to that of a full-service real estate finance platform that is primarily focused on the origination and acquisition of commercial real estate debt and equity investments across the capital structure, in both the U.S. and Europe. With the Starwood brand, market presence, and lending/asset management platform that we have developed, we are focused primarily on the following opportunities:\nTable 124: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nContinue to expand our market presence as a leading provider of acquisition, refinance, development and expansion capital to large real estate projects (greater than $75 million) in infill locations, and other attractive market niches where our size and scale give us an advantage to provide a one-stop\u201d lending solution for real estate developers, owners and operators;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nContinue to expand our investment activities in subordinate CMBS and revenues from special servicing;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nContinue to expand our capabilities in syndication and securitization, which serve as a source of attractively priced, matched-term financing;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nContinue to leverage our Investing and Servicing Segment's sourcing and credit underwriting capabilities to expand our overall footprint in the commercial real estate debt markets; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nExpand our investment activities in both (i) targeted real estate equity investments and (ii) residential mortgage finance.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to find appropriate investment opportunities.\nRecent Developments\nDevelopments During the Fourth Quarter of 2017\nDownREIT Portfolio Acquisition\nOn December 21, 2017, we entered into an agreement to acquire a 27-property, 6,109 unit, 99% occupied affordable housing portfolio located in Central and South Florida for $594.7 million, which includes $40.0 million of contingent consideration (the DownREIT Portfolio\u201d). On December 28, 2017, we acquired eight of these affordable housing communities (the First Closing\u201d), which include 1,740 units, for $156.2 million, including contingent consideration of $10.8 million. We financed the First Closing utilizing 10-year mortgage debt totaling $116.7 million with a fixed 3.81% interest rate.\nOther Developments\nTable 129: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThe Lending Segment originated or acquired the following loans during the quarter:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\no\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$345.0 million first mortgage loan for the refinancing of a loan originated by the Company in 2014 on a 57-story Class A+ office and condominium tower located in San Francisco, California, of which the Company funded $214.5 million.

the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues of our Lending Segment increased $50.2 million to $547.9 million, compared to $497.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to an\nincrease in interest income from loans principally due to higher average loan balances and LIBOR rates, partially offset by lower levels of prepayment related income.\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, costs and expenses of our Lending Segment increased $13.3 million to $127.1 million, compared to $113.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to (i) a $19.2 million increase in interest expense associated with the various secured financing facilities used to fund a portion of our investment portfolio and (ii) a $3.3 million increase in general, administrative and other expenses, partially offset by (iii) a $9.2 million decrease in our loan loss allowance.\nNet Interest Income (amounts in thousands)\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest income from loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n499,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n449,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n50,336\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest income from investment securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n46,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n47,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(531)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(107,167)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(88,000)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(19,167)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n439,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n408,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n30,638\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net interest income of our Lending Segment increased $30.6 million to $439.3 million, compared to $408.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase reflects the increase in interest income explained in the Revenues discussion above, partially offset by the increase in interest expense on our secured financing facilities.\nDuring each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the weighted average unlevered yield on the Lending Segment's loans and investment securities was 7.5%. The weighted average unlevered yield remained unchanged primarily due to the benefits of increases in LIBOR which offset lower levels of prepayment related income and declines in interest rate spreads for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Lending Segment's weighted average secured borrowing rates, inclusive of interest rate hedging costs and the amortization of deferred financing fees, were 3.8% and 3.4%, respectively, and 3.7% and 3.3%, respectively, excluding the impact of bridge financing. The increases in borrowing rates primarily reflect increases in LIBOR.\nOther Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, other income of our Lending Segment decreased $5.1 million to $4.1 million, compared to $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a $76.8 million unfavorable change in gain (loss) on derivatives, partially offset by a $71.2 million favorable change in foreign currency gain (loss). The unfavorable change from derivatives reflects a $77.6 million unfavorable change on foreign currency hedges, partially offset by a $0.8 million decreased loss on interest rate swaps. The foreign currency hedges are used to fix the U.S. dollar amounts of cash flows (both interest and principal payments) we expect to receive from our foreign currency denominated loans and CMBS investments. The unfavorable change on the foreign currency hedges and the favorable change in foreign currency gain (loss) reflect the overall weakening of the U.S. dollar against the GBP in the year ended December 31, 2017 versus a strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the year ended December 31, 2016. The interest rate swaps are used primarily to fix our interest rate payments on certain variable rate borrowings which fund fixed rate investments.\nProperty Segment\nChange in Results by Portfolio (amounts in thousands)\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ Change from prior year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCost and expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOther income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMaster Lease Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n13,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(2,354)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,536\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMedical Office Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n65,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n66,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(25,443)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(26,525)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIreland Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(37,882)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(37,384)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWoodstar Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(11,288)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(9,102)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,184\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDownREIT Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(88)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvestment in unconsolidated entities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(37,422)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(37,426)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther/Corporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(620)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n84,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n65,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(112,196)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(93,323)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the above-referenced Property Segment portfolios.\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues of our Property Segment increased $84.5 million to $199.1 million, compared to $114.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in revenues in the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the full period inclusion of rental income for the Medical Office Portfolio, which was acquired in December 2016, and the Woodstar Portfolio, which was acquired over a period from October 2015 through April 2016. Also contributing to the increase was rental income from the Master Lease Portfolio which was acquired on September 25, 2017. The DownREIT Portfolio was acquired on December 28, 2017, so had little impact on revenues.\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, costs and expenses of our Property Segment increased $65.6 million to $197.5 million, compared to $131.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in costs and expenses reflects increases of $22.9 million in depreciation and amortization, $24.7 million in other rental related costs and $24.5 million in interest expense, all primarily due to the full period inclusion of the Medical Office Portfolio and Woodstar Portfolio and acquisition of the Master Lease Portfolio, partially offset by lower amortization related to the Woodstar Portfolio's in-place lease intangible asset, which is now fully amortized, and a $7.5 million decrease in acquisition costs not capitalized.\nOther Income (Loss)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, other income (loss) of our Property Segment decreased $112.2 million to a loss of $59.9 million, compared to income of $52.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in other income (loss) was primarily due to (i) a $65.8 million unfavorable change in gain (loss) on derivatives of which $38.7 million related to foreign exchange contracts which economically hedge our Euro currency exposure with respect to the Ireland Portfolio and $27.1 million related to interest rate swaps which primarily hedge the variable interest rate risk on borrowings secured by our Medical Office Portfolio, (ii) a $37.4 million unfavorable change in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities due to decreases in fair value of the properties in the Retail Fund (see Notes 8 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and (iii) the non-recurrence of an $8.4 million bargain purchase gain recognized on the Woodstar Portfolio in the second quarter of 2016.\nInvesting and Servicing Segment and VIEs\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues of our Investing and Servicing Segment decreased $39.4 million to $132.9 million after consolidated VIE eliminations of $179.4 million, compared to $172.3 million after consolidated VIE eliminations of $180.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The VIE eliminations are merely a function of the number of CMBS trusts consolidated in any given period, and as such, are not a meaningful indicator of the operating results for this segment. The decrease in revenues in the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to decreases of $27.4 million in servicing fees and $17.5 million in interest income from CMBS investments, partially offset by a $12.3 million increase in rental income on our expanded REIS Equity Portfolio. The $27.4 million decrease in servicing fees is primarily due to the divestiture of our European servicing and advisory business in October 2016 and lower domestic servicing fees. The $17.5 million decrease in CMBS interest income reflects a $5.6 million increase in VIE eliminations related to the CMBS trusts we consolidate. Excluding the effect of these eliminations, CMBS interest income decreased by $11.9 million, reflecting a lower level of CMBS interest recoveries from asset liquidations by CMBS trusts.\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, costs and expenses of our Investing and Servicing Segment decreased $17.1 million to $157.1 million, compared to $174.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, inclusive of VIE eliminations which were nominal for both periods. The decrease in costs and expenses was primarily due to a $26.9 million decrease in general and administrative expenses principally reflecting the divestiture of our European servicing and advisory business and lower compensation costs, partially offset by increases of $4.4 million in costs of rental operations, $3.9 million in depreciation and amortization and $3.2 million in interest expense, all primarily related to our expanded REIS Equity Portfolio.\nOther Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, other income of our Investing and Servicing Segment increased $176.6 million to $362.1 million including additive net VIE eliminations of $186.1 million, from $185.5 million including additive net VIE eliminations of $181.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in other income was primarily due to (i) a $100.8 million increase in the change in value of net assets related to consolidated VIEs, (ii) a $53.9 million increase in earnings from an unconsolidated investor entity which owns equity in an online real estate company (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), (iii) a $22.8 million lesser decrease in fair value of servicing rights partially reflecting the effect of VIE eliminations on the expected amortization of this deteriorating asset net of increases in fair value due to the attainment of new servicing contracts, (iv) a $19.8 million gain on sale of five operating properties, all partially offset by (v) a $9.6 million lesser increase in the fair value of our conduit loans held-for-sale. The change in net assets related to consolidated VIEs reflects amounts associated with the Investing and Servicing Segment's variable interests in CMBS trusts it consolidates, including special servicing fees, interest income, and changes in fair value of CMBS and servicing rights. As noted above, this number is merely a function of the number of CMBS trusts consolidated in any given period, and as such, is not a meaningful indicator of the operating results for this segment. Before VIE eliminations, there was an increase in fair value of CMBS securities of $54.3 million and a decrease of $44.1 million in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nIncome Tax Provision\nHistorically, our consolidated income tax provision principally relates to the taxable nature of the Investing and Servicing Segment's loan servicing and loan conduit businesses which are housed in TRSs. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our income tax provision increased $23.2 million to $31.5 million, compared to $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change primarily reflects (i) an increase in the taxable income of our TRSs associated with earnings from our interest in an investor entity which owns equity in an online real estate company and sold nearly all of its interest during the year ended December 31, 2017 and (ii) an income tax provision of $10.4 million resulting from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets upon enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 (see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nCorporate\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, corporate expenses increased $22.3 million to $253.5 million, compared to $231.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to (i) a $17.9 million increase in interest expense principally on our 2021 Senior Notes issued in December 2016 and our 2025 Senior Notes issued in December 2017, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on our reduced term loan borrowings and our 2017 Convertible Notes which matured in October 2017, and (ii) a $5.0 million increase in management fees.\nOther Loss\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, corporate other loss increased $2.1 million to $6.6 million, compared to $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in corporate other loss was primarily due to (i) a $2.5 million decrease in other income, which included a reimbursement received related to a partnership guarantee arrangement in 2016, and (ii) a $2.4 million loss on an interest rate swap used to hedge the portion of our 2025 Senior Notes used to repay variable-rate secured financing, partially offset by (iii) a $2.8 million decreased loss on extinguishment of debt (see Notes 10 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nLending Segment\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, revenues of our Lending Segment decreased $31.7 million to $497.7 million, compared to $529.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to (i) a $20.8 million decrease in interest income from investment securities principally due to maturities during 2015 of two preferred equity interests we held in companies that own commercial real estate, the absence of $5.4 million of income realized upon the collection of an RMBS in 2015 and the absence of a $5.3 million CMBS prepayment fee recognized in 2015 and (ii) a $10.9 million decrease in interest income from loans principally due to a gradual decline of interest rate spreads and lower average loan balances during 2016, the effects of which were partially offset by higher loan fee income from increased levels of loan prepayments in 2016.\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, costs and expenses of our Lending Segment increased $7.4 million to $113.7 million, compared to $106.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to a $6.3 million increase in interest expense associated with the various secured financing facilities used to fund a portion of our investment portfolio and a $3.8 million increase in our loan loss allowance, partially offset by a $3.2 million decrease in G&A expenses primarily due to lower compensation costs.\nNet Interest Income (amounts in thousands)\nTable 171: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest income from loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n449,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n460,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(10,895)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest income from investment securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n47,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n68,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(20,818)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(88,000)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(81,676)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6,324)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n408,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n446,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(38,037)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net interest income of our Lending Segment decreased $38.0 million to $408.7 million, compared to $446.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease reflects the net decrease in interest income explained in the Revenues discussion above and the increase in interest expense on our secured financing facilities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the weighted average unlevered yields on the Lending Segment's loans and investment securities were 7.5% and 8.0%, respectively. The decrease in the weighted average unlevered yield is primarily due to a gradual decline of interest rate spreads during 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Lending Segment's weighted average secured borrowing rates, inclusive of interest rate hedging costs and the amortization of deferred financing fees, were 3.4% and 3.2%, respectively, and 3.3% and 2.9%, respectively, excluding the impact of bridge financing. The increases in the Lending Segment's weighted average secured borrowing rates are primarily due to increases in LIBOR.\nOther Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, other income of our Lending Segment increased $6.3 million to $9.2 million, compared to $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to a $10.8 million increase in derivative gains, partially offset by a $3.9 million decrease in net gains from other investments. The $10.8 million increase in derivative gains reflects a $6.8 million increased gain on foreign currency hedges and a $4.0 million decreased loss on interest rate swaps. The foreign currency hedges are used to fix the U.S. dollar amounts of cash flows (both interest and principal payments) we expect to receive from our foreign currency denominated loans and CMBS investments. The gains on those hedges reflected the overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar in 2016. The interest rate swaps are used primarily to fix our interest rate payments on certain variable rate borrowings which fund fixed rate investments.\nProperty Segment\nChange in Results by Portfolio (amounts in thousands)\nTable 172: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ Change from prior year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCost and expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOther income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMedical Office Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n25,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n18,467\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIreland Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,154\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWoodstar Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n76,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n81,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,728\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvestment in unconsolidated entities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(354)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(354)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther/Corporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(76)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(31)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n89,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n95,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n35,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n29,040\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, revenues of our Property Segment increased $89.2 million to $114.6 million, compared to $25.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

The increase in costs and expenses was primarily due to increases of $35.6 million in depreciation and amortization, $42.0 million in other rental related costs and $16.4 million in interest expense primarily on the secured financing for the Woodstar and Ireland Portfolios.\nOther Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, other income of our Property Segment increased $35.6 million to $52.3 million, compared to $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in other income was primarily due to (i) a $28.4 million increase in derivative gains primarily relating to interest rate swaps entered into in anticipation\nof debt financing for the acquisition of the Medical Office Portfolio and (ii) the recognition of an $8.4 million bargain purchase gain on the final two properties we purchased for the Woodstar Portfolio during the second quarter of 2016.\nInvesting and Servicing Segment and VIEs\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, revenues of our Investing and Servicing Segment decreased $8.7 million to $172.3 million after consolidated VIE eliminations of $180.5 million, compared to $181.0 million after consolidated VIE eliminations of $230.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The VIE eliminations are merely a function of the number of CMBS trusts consolidated in any given period, and as such, are not a meaningful indicator of the operating results for this segment. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to decreases of $28.5 million in servicing fees, $5.4 million in other fee income and $2.0 million in interest income from CMBS investments, partially offset by an increase of $27.0 million in rental income on our expanded REIS Equity Portfolio. The $2.0 million decrease in CMBS interest income reflects a $7.7 million decrease in VIE eliminations related to the CMBS trusts we consolidate. Excluding the effect of these eliminations, CMBS interest income decreased by $9.7 million, primarily reflecting a lower level of CMBS interest recoveries.\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, costs and expenses of our Investing and Servicing Segment increased $16.2 million to $174.2 million, compared to $158.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, inclusive of VIE eliminations, which were nominal for both periods. The increase in costs and expenses was primarily due to increases of $11.5 million in costs of rental operations and $5.1 million in interest expense on secured financings for CMBS and the REIS Equity Portfolio.\nOther Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, other income of our Investing and Servicing Segment decreased $70.6 million to $185.5 million including additive net VIE eliminations of $181.2 million, from $256.1 million including additive net VIE eliminations of $232.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in other income was primarily due to (i) a decrease of $33.9 million in the change in value of net assets related to consolidated VIEs, (ii) a $34.5 million greater reduction in fair value of servicing rights which reflects the expected amortization of this deteriorating asset net of increases in fair value due to the attainment of new servicing contracts, (iii) the absence of a $17.8 million gain on sale of a commercial real estate asset realized in 2015 and (iv) a $4.3 million unfavorable change in fair value of CMBS securities, all partially offset by (v) a $9.9 million greater increase in fair value of loans held-for-sale and (vi) a $9.9 million lower loss on derivatives which principally hedge our interest rate risk on those loans. The change in net assets related to consolidated VIEs reflects amounts associated with the Investing and Servicing Segment's variable interests in CMBS trusts it consolidates, including special servicing fees, interest income, and changes in fair value of CMBS and servicing rights. As noted above, this number is merely a function of the number of CMBS trusts consolidated in any given period, and as such, is not a meaningful indicator of the operating results for this segment. Before VIE eliminations, there were decreases in fair value of CMBS securities of $44.1 million and $10.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nIncome Tax Provision\nHistorically, our consolidated income tax provision principally relates to the taxable nature of the Investing and Servicing Segment's loan servicing and loan conduit businesses which are housed in TRSs. Our tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2016, as well as the overall effective tax rate, is lower than for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to a decrease in the taxable income of our TRSs.\nCorporate\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, corporate expenses decreased $4.5 million to $231.2 million, compared to $235.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.2 million decrease in management fees partially offset by a $3.7 million increase in other corporate expenses, including acquisition and investment pursuit costs.\nOther Loss\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, corporate other loss decreased $1.4 million to $4.5 million, compared to $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was due to a $4.3 million increase in other income, including reimbursements received in 2016 related to a partnership guarantee arrangement, partially offset by a $2.9 million increase in loss on extinguishment of debt.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nCore Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure. We calculate Core Earnings as GAAP net income (loss) excluding the following:\nTable 173: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(i)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nnon-cash equity compensation expense;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(ii)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nincentive fees due under our management agreement;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(iii)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ndepreciation and amortization of real estate and associated intangibles;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(iv)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nacquisition costs associated with successful acquisitions; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(v)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nany unrealized gains, losses or other non-cash items recorded in net income for the period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe repurchase of our 2018 Notes in March 2017 was considered to be an unrealized event for Core Earnings purposes because the 2018 Notes were effectively exchanged for the 2023 Notes, thereby simply extending the term of this debt. As such, consistent with the above definition, we have deferred the $5.9 million GAAP loss on extinguishment of debt included in our GAAP results for the year ended December 31, 2017 and will amortize this loss over the term of our 2023 Notes.\nWe believe that Core Earnings provides an additional measure of our core operating performance by eliminating the impact of certain non-cash expenses and facilitating a comparison of our financial results to those of other comparable REITs with fewer or no non-cash adjustments and comparison of our own operating results from period to period. Our management uses Core Earnings in this way, and also uses Core Earnings to compute the incentive fee due under our management agreement. The Company believes that its investors also use Core Earnings or a comparable supplemental performance measure to evaluate and compare the performance of the Company and its peers, and as such, the Company believes that the disclosure of Core Earnings is useful to (and expected by) its investors.\nHowever, the Company cautions that Core Earnings does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), or an indication of our cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), a measure of our liquidity, or an indication of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition, our methodology for calculating Core Earnings may differ from the methodologies employed by other REITs to calculate the same or similar supplemental performance measures, and accordingly, our reported Core Earnings may not be comparable to the Core Earnings reported by other REITs.\nIn assessing the appropriate weighted average diluted share count to apply to Core Earnings for purposes of determining Core Earnings per share ( EPS\u201d), management considered the following attributes of our current GAAP diluted share methodology: (i) our unvested stock awards representing participating securities were determined to be anti-dilutive and were thus excluded from the denominator of the EPS calculation; and (ii) the portion of the convertible senior notes that are in-the-money\u201d (referred to as the conversion spread value\u201d), representing the value that would be delivered to investors in shares upon an assumed conversion, is included in the denominator. Because compensation expense related to unvested stock awards is added back for Core Earnings purposes pursuant to the definition above, there is no dilution to Core Earnings resulting from the associated expense recognition. As a result, for purposes of determining Core EPS, our GAAP EPS methodology was adjusted to include (instead of exclude) such unvested awards. Further, conversion of the convertible senior notes is an event that is contingent upon numerous factors, none of which are in our control, and is an event that may or may not occur. Consistent with the treatment of other unrealized adjustments to Core Earnings, our GAAP EPS methodology was adjusted to exclude (instead of include) the conversion spread value in determining Core EPS until a conversion actually occurs. The following table presents our diluted weighted average shares used in our GAAP EPS calculation reconciled to our diluted weighted average shares used in our Core EPS calculation (amounts in thousands):\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDiluted weighted average shares - GAAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n262,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n241,794\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n234,142\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdd: Unvested stock awards\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,132\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLess: Conversion spread value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,899)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,697)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(97)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDiluted weighted average shares - Core\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n261,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n240,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n236,177\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe definition of Core Earnings allows management to make adjustments, subject to the approval of a majority of our independent directors, in situations where such adjustments are considered appropriate in order for Core Earnings to be calculated in a manner consistent with its definition and objective. No adjustments to the definition of Core Earnings occurred during the year ended December 31, 2017. However, as a reminder, in 2015, we adjusted the calculation of Core Earnings related to the equity component of our convertible notes. We amortize the equity component of these instruments through interest expense. The amount is not considered realized until the earlier of (a) the entire issuance of the notes has been extinguished; or (b) the equity portion has been fully amortized. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the 2017 Notes matured and the equity portion of these notes had been fully amortized. As a result, we reflected $15.2 million as a positive adjustment to Core Earnings, representing the $15.6 million equity balance recognized upon issuance of the 2017 Notes, net of $0.4 million in adjustments related to cumulative repurchases through the maturity date.\nIn February 2018, our board of directors approved an amendment (the Amendment\u201d) to our management agreement which, among other things, amends the definition of Core Earnings and the calculation of Incentive Compensation, both as defined. The intent of the Amendment is to treat subsidiary equity in the same manner as if parent equity had been issued. In the case of the DownREIT Portfolio, any distributions that accrue to the holders of the Class A Units are reflected as a reduction to net income attributable to non-controlling interests within our GAAP consolidated statements of operations. The Amendment adjusts the definition of Core Earnings so that any reductions to GAAP net income for such distributions are added back. Further, the redeemable Class A Units are only reflected in our GAAP diluted share count to the extent they are dilutive. The Amendment adjusts the definition of Incentive Compensation so that all Class A units issued are included in the denominator for purposes of determining whether the hurdle rate has been met. The Amendment is effective December 28, 2017, and as a result, the impact to both Core Earnings and the incentive fee for the year ended December 31, 2017 was insignificant.\nThe following table summarizes our quarterly Core Earnings per weighted average diluted share for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

After making adjustments for the calculation of Core Earnings, revenues were $197.6 million, costs and expenses were $124.3 million and other income was $2.8 million.\nCore revenues increased by $86.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the inclusion of a full period of rental income for the Medical Office Portfolio and the Woodstar Portfolio and the acquisition of the Master Lease Portfolio.\nCore costs and expenses increased by $51.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to increases in interest expense of $25.1 million, primarily on the secured financing for the Medical Office and Master Lease Portfolios, and rental related costs of $24.5 million.\nCore other income decreased by $5.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to a decrease in equity in earnings recognized from our investment in the Retail Fund.\nInvesting and Servicing Segment\nThe Investing and Servicing Segment's Core Earnings increased by $29.2 million, from $242.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 to $271.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. After making adjustments for the calculation of Core Earnings, revenues were $326.1 million, costs and expenses were $134.9 million, other income was $114.4 million, income tax provision was $30.6 million and the deduction of income attributable to non-controlling interests was $3.4 million.\nCore revenues decreased by $46.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to decreases of $33.8 million in servicing fees reflecting the divestiture of our European servicing and advisory business and lower domestic servicing fees, $17.6 million in interest income from our CMBS portfolio and $3.7 million in interest income from conduit loans, partially offset by a $12.5 million increase in rental income on our expanded REIS Equity Portfolio. The treatment of CMBS interest income on a GAAP basis is complicated by our application of the ASC 810 consolidation rules. In an attempt to treat these securities similar to the trust's other investment securities, we compute core interest income pursuant to an effective yield methodology. In doing so, we segregate the portfolio into various categories based on the components of the bonds' cash flows and the volatility related to each of these components. We then accrete interest income on an effective yield basis using the components of cash flows that are reliably estimable. Other minor adjustments are made to reflect management's expectations for other components of the projected cash flow stream.\nCore costs and expenses decreased by $17.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to a decrease in general and administrative expenses reflecting the divestiture of our European servicing and advisory business and lower incentive compensation, partially offset by increases in costs of rental operations and interest expense on secured financings for CMBS and the REIS Equity Portfolio.\nCore other income includes profit realized upon securitization of loans by our conduit business, gains on sales of CMBS, gains and losses on derivatives that were either effectively terminated or novated, and earnings from unconsolidated entities. These items are typically offset by a decrease in the fair value of our domestic servicing rights intangible which reflects the expected amortization of this deteriorating asset, net of increases in fair value due to the attainment of new servicing contracts. Derivatives include instruments which hedge interest rate risk and credit risk on our conduit loans. For GAAP purposes, the loans, CMBS and derivatives are accounted for at fair value, with all changes in fair value (realized or unrealized) recognized in earnings. The adjustments to Core Earnings outlined above are also applied to the GAAP earnings of our unconsolidated entities. Core other income increased by $81.4 million principally due to (i) a $52.4 million realized gain from an unconsolidated investor entity which owns equity in an online real estate company and sold nearly all of its interest during the third quarter of 2017, (ii) a $23.2 million increase in realized gains on sales of operating properties and CMBS and (iii) a $21.4 million decrease in amortization of servicing rights, all partially offset by (iv) a $9.4 million decrease in realized gains on conduit loans and (v) core write-downs of $5.5 million on CMBS.\nIncome taxes, which principally relate to the operating results of our servicing and conduit businesses which are held in TRSs, increased $20.6 million due to (i) an increase in the taxable income of our TRSs primarily associated with realized gains from our interest in an investor entity which owns equity in an online real estate company and sold nearly all of its interest during the third quarter of 2017 and (ii) the impact of remeasuring our net deferred tax assets upon enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017.\nIncome attributable to non-controlling interests increased $2.5 million primarily due to minority investors' share of gains from two operating properties sold during the third quarter of 2017.\nCorporate\nCore corporate costs and expenses increased by $3.4 million, from $179.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 to $183.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to increases in interest expense of $18.7 million and base management fees of $6.8 million, partially offset by a favorable change in core gains (losses) on extinguishment of debt of $24.0 million.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nLending Segment\nThe Lending Segment's Core Earnings decreased by $33.7 million, from $427.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 to $393.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. After making adjustments for the calculation of Core Earnings, revenues were $496.7 million, costs and expenses were $107.2 million and other income was $3.8 million.\nCore revenues, consisting principally of interest income on loans, decreased by $31.8 million during 2016 primarily due to (i) a $20.9 million decrease in interest income from investment securities principally due to maturities during 2015 of two preferred equity interests we held in companies that own commercial real estate, the absence of $5.4 million of income realized upon the collection of an RMBS in 2015 and the absence of a $5.3 million CMBS prepayment fee recognized in 2015 and (ii) a $10.9 million decrease in interest income from loans principally due to a gradual decline of interest rate spreads and lower average loan balances during 2016, the effects of which were partially offset by higher loan fee income from increased levels of loan prepayments in 2016.\nCore costs and expenses increased by $3.2 million, primarily due to a $6.3 million increase in interest expense associated with the various secured financing facilities used to fund a portion of our investment portfolio, partially offset by a $3.7 million decrease in G&A expenses reflecting lower compensation costs.\nCore other income decreased by $0.5 million, principally due to an increased loss on foreign currency denominated assets and a decreased gain on sale of loan investments, partially offset by an increased gain on foreign currency derivatives.\nProperty Segment\nCore Earnings by Portfolio (amounts in thousands)\nTable 184: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMedical Office Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(20)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(20)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIreland Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12,496\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWoodstar Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n21,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18,133\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvestment in unconsolidated entities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,845)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther/Corporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,064)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,220)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCore Earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n46,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n18,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n27,920\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Property Segment's Core Earnings increased by $27.9 million, from $18.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 to $46.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.

The counterparty retains the sole discretion over both whether to purchase the loan and security from us and, subject to certain conditions, the market value of such loan or security for purposes of determining whether we are required to pay margin to the counterparty. Generally, if the lender determines (subject to certain conditions) that the market value of the collateral in a repurchase transaction has decreased by more than a defined minimum amount, we would be required to repay any amounts borrowed in excess of the product of (i) the revised market value multiplied by (ii) the applicable advance rate. During the term of a repurchase agreement, we receive the principal and interest on the related loans and securities and pay interest to the counterparty. As of December 31, 2017, we had various repurchase agreements, with details referenced in the table provided below.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 187: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSecured Property Financings: We use long-term mortgage facilities from commercial lenders and government sponsors of affordable housing loans to finance many of the investment properties that we hold.

The sales, syndications or securitizations generally involve a senior portion of our loan, but may involve the entire loan. Loan sales and syndications generally involve the sale of a senior note component or participation interest to a third party lender. Securitization generally involves transferring notes to a special purpose vehicle (or the issuing entity), which then issues one or more classes of non-recourse notes pursuant to the terms of an indenture. The notes are secured by the pool of assets. In exchange for the transfer of assets to the issuing entity, we receive cash proceeds from the sale of non-recourse notes. Sales, syndications or securitizations of our portfolio investments might magnify our exposure to losses on those portfolio investments because the retained subordinate interest in any particular overall loan would be subordinate to the loan components sold and we would, therefore, absorb all losses sustained with respect to the overall loan before the owners of the senior notes experience any losses with respect to the loan in question.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 190: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nUnsecured Senior Notes: We issue senior notes, some of which are convertible, to finance certain operating and investing activities of the Company.

There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to access the capital markets at any particular time or on any particular terms. We have authorized 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock and 500,000,000 shares of common stock. At December 31, 2017, we had 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock available for issuance and 238,623,576 shares of common stock available for issuance.\nRefer to Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our issuances of equity securities in recent years.\nOther Potential Sources of Financing\nIn the future, we may also use other sources of financing to fund the acquisition of our target assets, including other secured as well as unsecured forms of borrowing and sale of certain investment securities which no longer meet our return requirements.\nRepurchases of Equity Securities and Convertible Senior Notes\nIn September 2014, our board of directors authorized and announced the repurchase of up to $250.0 million of our outstanding common stock over a period of one year. Subsequent amendments to the repurchase program approved by our board of directors in December 2014, June 2015, January 2016 and February 2017 resulted in the program being (i) amended to increase maximum repurchases to $500.0 million, (ii) expanded to allow for the repurchase of our outstanding convertible senior notes under the program and (iii) extended through January 2019. Purchases made pursuant to the program are made in either the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time as permitted by federal securities laws and other legal requirements. The timing, manner, price and amount of any\nrepurchases are discretionary and will be subject to economic and market conditions, stock price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we repurchased $230.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2018 Notes for $250.7 million, however, this repurchase was not considered part of the repurchase program and therefore does not reduce our available capacity for future repurchases under the repurchase program. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not repurchase any common stock under the repurchase program. As of December 31, 2017, we had $262.2 million of remaining capacity to repurchase common stock and/or convertible senior notes under the repurchase program.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have relationships with unconsolidated entities and financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as VIEs. Our maximum risk of loss associated with our involvement in VIEs is limited to the carrying value of our investment in the entity and any unfunded capital commitments. Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nDividends\nWe intend to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of our common stock. U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it annually distributes less than 100% of its net taxable income. We intend to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends to our stockholders in an amount approximating our net taxable income, if and to the extent authorized by our board of directors. Before we pay any dividend, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, we must first meet both our operating and debt service requirements. If our cash available for distribution is less than our net taxable income, we could be required to sell assets or borrow funds to make cash distributions or we may make a portion of the required distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities. Refer to Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed dividend history.\nThe tax treatment for our aggregate distributions per share of common stock paid with respect to the 2017 tax year is as follows:\nTable 215: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOrdinary\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTaxable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPer Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTaxable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nQualified\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCapital Gain\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nUnrecaptured\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNondividend\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRecord Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayable Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDividend Paid\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDividends\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDividends\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDistribution\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1250 Gain\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDistributions\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n12/30/2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1/13/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.3862 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.3485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.0282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.0377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.0007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n3/31/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4/14/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.4800 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.4331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n6/30/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7/14/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.4800 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.4331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n9/29/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10/13/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.4800 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.4331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n12/29/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1/12/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.1456 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.1315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1.9718 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1.7793\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.1441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.1925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.0036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTo the extent that total dividends for the 2017 tax year exceeded 2017 taxable income, the portion of the fourth quarter dividend paid in January of 2018 that is equal to such excess is treated as a 2018 dividend for federal tax purposes.\nLeverage Policies\nWe employ leverage, to the extent available, to fund the acquisition of our target assets, increase potential returns to our stockholders, or provide temporary liquidity. Leverage can be either direct by utilizing private third party financing, or indirect through originating, acquiring, or retaining subordinated mortgages, B-Notes, subordinated loan participations or mezzanine loans. Although the type of leverage we deploy is dependent on the underlying asset that is being financed, we intend, when possible, to utilize leverage whose maturity is equal to or greater than the maturity of the underlying asset and minimize to the greatest extent possible exposure to the Company of credit losses associated with any individual asset. In addition, we intend to mitigate the impact of potential future interest rate increases on our borrowings through utilization of hedging instruments, primarily interest rate swap agreements.\nThe amount of leverage we deploy for particular investments in our target assets depends upon our Manager's assessment of a variety of factors, which may include the anticipated liquidity and price volatility of the assets in our investment portfolio, the potential for losses and extension risk in our portfolio, the gap between the duration of our assets and liabilities, including hedges, the availability and cost of financing the assets, our opinion of the creditworthiness of our financing counterparties, the health of the U.S. and European economy and commercial and residential mortgage markets, our outlook for the level, slope, and volatility of interest rates, the credit quality of our assets, the collateral underlying our assets, and our outlook for asset spreads relative to the LIBOR curve. Under our current repurchase agreements and bank credit facility, our total leverage may not exceed 75% of total assets (as defined), as adjusted to remove the impact of bona-fide loan sales that are accounted for as financings and the consolidation of VIEs pursuant to GAAP. As of December 31, 2017, our total debt to assets ratio was 61.6%.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nContractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 are as follows (amounts in thousands):\nTable 216: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMore than\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 to 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3 to 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSecured financings (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5,813,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n441,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,705,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n873,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,792,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUnsecured senior notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,161,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n369,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n341,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n700,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n750,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSecured borrowings on transferred loans (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n75,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n75,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoan funding commitments (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,310,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n755,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n546,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFuture lease commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n33,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,394,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,573,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,680,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,585,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,554,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 217: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRepresents the contractual maturity of the respective credit facility, inclusive of available extension options.

We believe that all of the decisions and assessments upon which our financial statements are based were reasonable at the time made, based upon information available to us at that time. The following discussion describes the critical accounting estimates that apply to our operations and require complex management judgment. This summary should be read in conjunction with a more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLoan Impairment\nWe evaluate each loan classified as held-for-investment for impairment at least quarterly. Impairment occurs when it is deemed probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. If a loan is considered to be impaired, we record an allowance through the provision for loan losses to reduce the carrying value of the loan to the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's contractual effective rate or the fair value of the collateral, if repayment is expected solely from the collateral.\nOur loans are typically collateralized by real estate. As a result, we regularly evaluate the extent and impact of any credit deterioration associated with the performance and/or value of the underlying collateral property, as well as the financial and operating capability of the borrower. Specifically, a property's operating results and any cash reserves are analyzed and used to assess (i) whether cash from operations is sufficient to cover the debt service requirements currently and into the future, (ii) the ability of the borrower to refinance the loan, and/or (iii) the property's liquidation value. We also evaluate the financial wherewithal of any loan guarantors as well as the borrower's competency in managing and operating the properties. In addition, we consider the overall economic environment, real estate sector, and geographic sub-market in which the borrower operates. Such impairment analyses are completed and reviewed by asset management and finance personnel, who utilize various data sources, including (i) periodic financial data such as property operating statements, occupancy, tenant profile, rental rates, operating expenses, the borrower's exit plan, and capitalization and discount rates, (ii) site inspections, and (iii) current credit spreads and discussions with market participants.\nSignificant judgment is required when evaluating loans for impairment; therefore, actual results over time could be materially different. Historically, this segment has not had any realized losses on individual loans. However, we have established a general loan loss allowance based on our risk classification of the loans in our portfolio, as discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The general loan loss allowance was $4.3 million as of December 31, 2017.\nClassification and Impairment Evaluation of Investment Securities\nOur investment securities consist primarily of RMBS that we classify as available-for-sale, CMBS and mandatorily redeemable preferred equity interests in commercial real estate entities which we expect to hold to maturity and CMBS for which we have elected the fair value option. Investments classified as available-for-sale are carried at their fair value. For available-for-sale securities where we have not elected the fair value option, changes in fair value are recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders' equity, rather than through earnings. We do not hold any of our investment securities for trading purposes.\nWhen the estimated fair value of a security for which we have not elected to apply the fair value option is less than its amortized cost, we consider whether there is OTTI in the value of the security. An impairment is deemed an OTTI if (i) we intend to sell the security, (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering our cost basis, or (iii) we do not expect to recover our cost basis even if we do not intend to sell the security or do not believe it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering our cost basis. If the impairment is deemed to be an OTTI, the resulting accounting treatment depends on the factors causing the OTTI. If the OTTI has resulted from (i) our intention to sell the security, or (ii) our judgment that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering our cost basis, an impairment loss is recognized in earnings equal\nto the difference between our amortized cost basis and fair value. Whereas, if the OTTI has resulted from our conclusion that we will not recover our cost basis even if we do not intend to sell the security or do not believe it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering our cost basis, only the credit loss portion of the impairment is recorded in earnings, and the portion of the loss related to other factors, such as changes in interest rates, continues to be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. Determining whether there is an OTTI may require us to exercise significant judgment and make significant assumptions, including, but not limited to, estimated cash flows, estimated prepayments, loss assumptions, and assumptions regarding changes in interest rates. As a result, actual OTTI losses could differ from reported amounts. Such judgments and assumptions are based upon a number of factors, including (i) credit of the issuer or the borrowers, (ii) credit rating of the security, (iii) key terms of the security, (iv) performance of underlying loans, including debt service coverage and loan-to-value ratios, (v) the value of the collateral for underlying loans, (vi) the effect of local, industry, and broader economic factors, and (vii) the historical and anticipated trends in defaults and loss severities for similar securities. As of December 31, 2017, we held $247.0 million of available-for-sale RMBS which had gross unrealized gains of $58.0 million and $0.1 million of unrealized losses. We also had $433.5 million of held-to-maturity securities which had gross unrealized losses of $7.8 million and gross unrealized gains of $2.6 million as of December 31, 2017. We recognized OTTI charges against earnings with respect to our investment securities of $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. There were no OTTI charges recognized during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nValuation of Financial Assets and Liabilities Carried at Fair Value\nWe measure our VIE assets and liabilities, mortgage-backed securities, derivative assets and liabilities, domestic servicing rights intangible asset and any assets or liabilities where we have elected the fair value option at fair value. When actively quoted observable prices are not available, we either use implied pricing from similar assets and liabilities or valuation models based on net present values of estimated future cash flows, adjusted as appropriate for liquidity, credit, market and/or other risk factors. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding the various methods and inputs we use in measuring the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2017, we had $52.1 billion and $50.0 billion of financial assets and liabilities, respectively, that are measured at fair value, including $51.0 billion of VIE assets and $50.0 billion of VIE liabilities we consolidate pursuant to ASC 810.\nWe measure the assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs at fair value pursuant to our election of the fair value option. The VIEs in which we invest are static\u201d; that is, no reinvestment is permitted, and there is no active management of the underlying assets. In determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the VIE, we maximize the use of observable inputs over unobservable inputs. As a result, the methods and inputs we use in measuring the fair value of the assets and liabilities of our VIEs affect our earnings only to the extent of their impact on our direct investment in the VIEs.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nWe record all derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and have satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting under GAAP. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. We regularly enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of our risks, even though the transactions may not qualify for, or we may not elect to pursue, hedge accounting. In such cases, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in earnings. The designation of derivative contracts as hedges, the measurement of their effectiveness, and the estimate of the fair value of the contracts all may involve significant judgments by our management, and changes to those judgments could significantly impact our reported results of operations. As of December 31, 2017, we had $33.9 million of derivative assets and $36.2 million of derivative liabilities. We recognized\nnet losses on derivatives of $72.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and net gains on derivatives of $70.7 million and $21.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had less than $0.1 million of net unrecognized gains on derivatives designated as hedges.\nGoodwill Impairment\nOur goodwill at December 31, 2017 of $140.4 million represents the excess of consideration transferred over the fair value of LNR's net assets acquired on April 19, 2013. In testing goodwill for impairment, we follow ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, which permits a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value including goodwill. If the qualitative assessment determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value including goodwill, then no impairment is determined to exist for the reporting unit. However, if the qualitative assessment determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value including goodwill, we compare the fair value of that reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill ( Step One\u201d). If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired with the impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill.\nBased on our qualitative assessment during the 2017 fourth quarter, we believe that the Investing and Servicing Segment reporting unit to which all of our goodwill was attributed is not currently at risk of failing Step One of the impairment test. This qualitative assessment required judgment to be applied in evaluating the effects of multiple factors, including actual and projected financial performance of the reporting unit, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, and relevant entity specific events in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill.\nProperty Impairment\nWe review properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is determined by comparing the carrying amount of the property to the undiscounted future net cash flows it is expected to generate. If such carrying amount exceeds the expected undiscounted future net cash flows, we adjust the carrying amount of the property to its estimated fair value. The estimation of future net cash flows and fair values of our properties involves significant judgments by our management, and changes to these judgments could significantly impact our reported results of operation. As of December 31, 2017 we held properties with a carrying value of $2.6 billion, none of which we determined were impaired at any point during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nImpairment of Investments in Unconsolidated Entities\nInvestments in unconsolidated entities are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount of an investment over its estimated fair value. Impairment analyses are based on current plans, intended holding periods and available information at the time the analyses are prepared. As of December 31, 2017, we held investments in unconsolidated entities with a carrying value of $185.5 million, none of which we determined were impaired at any point during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nRecent Accounting Developments\nRefer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting developments and the expected impact to the Company.",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of the Company should be read in conjunction with Item 6, Selected Financial Data,\u201d and our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this Form 10-K\u201d). Certain statements we make under this Item 7 constitute forward-looking statements\u201d under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d preceding Part I of this Form 10-K. You should consider our forward-looking statements in light of our Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC.\nBusiness Objectives and Outlook\nOur objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our investors over the long-term, primarily through dividends and secondarily through capital appreciation. We intend to achieve our objective by originating and acquiring target assets to create a diversified investment portfolio that is financed in a manner that is designed to deliver attractive returns across a variety of market conditions and economic cycles. We are focused on our three core competencies: transaction access, asset analysis and selection, and identification of attractive relative values within the real estate debt and equity markets.\nSince our IPO in August 2009, we have evolved from a company focused on opportunistic acquisitions of real estate debt assets from distressed sellers to that of a full-service real estate finance platform that is primarily focused on the origination and acquisition of commercial real estate debt and equity investments across the capital structure, in both the U.S. and Europe. With the Starwood brand, market presence, and lending/asset management platform that we have developed, we are focused primarily on the following opportunities:\n (1) Continue to expand our market presence as a leading provider of acquisition, refinance, development and expansion capital to large real estate projects (greater than $75 million) in infill locations, and other attractive market niches where our size and scale give us an advantage to provide a one-stop\u201d lending solution for real estate developers, owners and operators; \n (2) Continue to expand our investment activities in subordinate CMBS and revenues from special servicing; \n (3) Continue to expand our capabilities in syndication and securitization, which serve as a source of attractively priced, matched-term financing; \n (4) Continue to leverage our Investing and Servicing Segment's sourcing and credit underwriting capabilities to expand our overall footprint in the commercial real estate debt markets; and \n (5) Expand our investment activities in both (i) targeted real estate equity investments and (ii) residential mortgage finance. \nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to find appropriate investment opportunities.\nRecent Developments\nDevelopments During the Fourth Quarter of 2017\nDownREIT Portfolio Acquisition\nOn December 21, 2017, we entered into an agreement to acquire a 27-property, 6,109 unit, 99% occupied affordable housing portfolio located in Central and South Florida for $594.7 million, which includes $40.0 million of contingent consideration (the DownREIT Portfolio\u201d). On December 28, 2017, we acquired eight of these affordable housing communities (the First Closing\u201d), which include 1,740 units, for $156.2 million, including contingent consideration of $10.8 million. We financed the First Closing utilizing 10-year mortgage debt totaling $116.7 million with a fixed 3.81% interest rate.\nOther Developments\n \u00b7 The Lending Segment originated or acquired the following loans during the quarter: \n o $345.0 million first mortgage loan for the refinancing of a loan originated by the Company in 2014 on a 57-story Class A+ office and condominium tower located in San Francisco, California, of which the Company funded $214.5 million. The office portion of the tower is fully leased to a premier global online social media and networking company. \n o \u00a3227.6 million first mortgage loan for the acquisition of 14 assisted living facilities located across the United Kingdom, of which the Company funded \u00a3208.1 million. \n o $200.0 million first mortgage participation for the development of a 1.2 million square foot residential tower located in Midtown Manhattan, of which the Company funded $52.2 million. \n o $183.0 million first mortgage and mezzanine loan for the refinancing of a loan originated by the Company in 2015 on a 1,250-room luxury hotel located in Atlanta, Georgia, which was fully funded upon origination. \n o $125.0 million first mortgage and mezzanine loan for the development of a mixed-use development, consisting of a residential tower, hotel, ground floor retail, and parking garage, located in Coral Gables, Florida.

For a discussion of our results of operations excluding the impact of ASC 810 as it relates to the consolidation of securitization VIEs, refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section herein.\nThe following table compares our summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 by business segment (amounts in thousands):\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nLending Segment\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues of our Lending Segment increased $50.2 million to $547.9 million, compared to $497.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to an\nincrease in interest income from loans principally due to higher average loan balances and LIBOR rates, partially offset by lower levels of prepayment related income.\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, costs and expenses of our Lending Segment increased $13.3 million to $127.1 million, compared to $113.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to (i) a $19.2 million increase in interest expense associated with the various secured financing facilities used to fund a portion of our investment portfolio and (ii) a $3.3 million increase in general, administrative and other expenses, partially offset by (iii) a $9.2 million decrease in our loan loss allowance.\nNet Interest Income (amounts in thousands)\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net interest income of our Lending Segment increased $30.6 million to $439.3 million, compared to $408.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase reflects the increase in interest income explained in the Revenues discussion above, partially offset by the increase in interest expense on our secured financing facilities.\nDuring each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the weighted average unlevered yield on the Lending Segment's loans and investment securities was 7.5%. The weighted average unlevered yield remained unchanged primarily due to the benefits of increases in LIBOR which offset lower levels of prepayment related income and declines in interest rate spreads for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Lending Segment's weighted average secured borrowing rates, inclusive of interest rate hedging costs and the amortization of deferred financing fees, were 3.8% and 3.4%, respectively, and 3.7% and 3.3%, respectively, excluding the impact of bridge financing. The increases in borrowing rates primarily reflect increases in LIBOR.\nOther Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, other income of our Lending Segment decreased $5.1 million to $4.1 million, compared to $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a $76.8 million unfavorable change in gain (loss) on derivatives, partially offset by a $71.2 million favorable change in foreign currency gain (loss). The unfavorable change from derivatives reflects a $77.6 million unfavorable change on foreign currency hedges, partially offset by a $0.8 million decreased loss on interest rate swaps. The foreign currency hedges are used to fix the U.S. dollar amounts of cash flows (both interest and principal payments) we expect to receive from our foreign currency denominated loans and CMBS investments. The unfavorable change on the foreign currency hedges and the favorable change in foreign currency gain (loss) reflect the overall weakening of the U.S. dollar against the GBP in the year ended December 31, 2017 versus a strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the year ended December 31, 2016. The interest rate swaps are used primarily to fix our interest rate payments on certain variable rate borrowings which fund fixed rate investments.\nProperty Segment\nChange in Results by Portfolio (amounts in thousands)\n\nSee Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the above-referenced Property Segment portfolios.\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues of our Property Segment increased $84.5 million to $199.1 million, compared to $114.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in revenues in the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the full period inclusion of rental income for the Medical Office Portfolio, which was acquired in December 2016, and the Woodstar Portfolio, which was acquired over a period from October 2015 through April 2016. Also contributing to the increase was rental income from the Master Lease Portfolio which was acquired on September 25, 2017. The DownREIT Portfolio was acquired on December 28, 2017, so had little impact on revenues.\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, costs and expenses of our Property Segment increased $65.6 million to $197.5 million, compared to $131.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in costs and expenses reflects increases of $22.9 million in depreciation and amortization, $24.7 million in other rental related costs and $24.5 million in interest expense, all primarily due to the full period inclusion of the Medical Office Portfolio and Woodstar Portfolio and acquisition of the Master Lease Portfolio, partially offset by lower amortization related to the Woodstar Portfolio's in-place lease intangible asset, which is now fully amortized, and a $7.5 million decrease in acquisition costs not capitalized.\nOther Income (Loss)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, other income (loss) of our Property Segment decreased $112.2 million to a loss of $59.9 million, compared to income of $52.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in other income (loss) was primarily due to (i) a $65.8 million unfavorable change in gain (loss) on derivatives of which $38.7 million related to foreign exchange contracts which economically hedge our Euro currency exposure with respect to the Ireland Portfolio and $27.1 million related to interest rate swaps which primarily hedge the variable interest rate risk on borrowings secured by our Medical Office Portfolio, (ii) a $37.4 million unfavorable change in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities due to decreases in fair value of the properties in the Retail Fund (see Notes 8 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and (iii) the non-recurrence of an $8.4 million bargain purchase gain recognized on the Woodstar Portfolio in the second quarter of 2016.\nInvesting and Servicing Segment and VIEs\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues of our Investing and Servicing Segment decreased $39.4 million to $132.9 million after consolidated VIE eliminations of $179.4 million, compared to $172.3 million after consolidated VIE eliminations of $180.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The VIE eliminations are merely a function of the number of CMBS trusts consolidated in any given period, and as such, are not a meaningful indicator of the operating results for this segment. The decrease in revenues in the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to decreases of $27.4 million in servicing fees and $17.5 million in interest income from CMBS investments, partially offset by a $12.3 million increase in rental income on our expanded REIS Equity Portfolio. The $27.4 million decrease in servicing fees is primarily due to the divestiture of our European servicing and advisory business in October 2016 and lower domestic servicing fees. The $17.5 million decrease in CMBS interest income reflects a $5.6 million increase in VIE eliminations related to the CMBS trusts we consolidate. Excluding the effect of these eliminations, CMBS interest income decreased by $11.9 million, reflecting a lower level of CMBS interest recoveries from asset liquidations by CMBS trusts.\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, costs and expenses of our Investing and Servicing Segment decreased $17.1 million to $157.1 million, compared to $174.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, inclusive of VIE eliminations which were nominal for both periods. The decrease in costs and expenses was primarily due to a $26.9 million decrease in general and administrative expenses principally reflecting the divestiture of our European servicing and advisory business and lower compensation costs, partially offset by increases of $4.4 million in costs of rental operations, $3.9 million in depreciation and amortization and $3.2 million in interest expense, all primarily related to our expanded REIS Equity Portfolio.\nOther Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, other income of our Investing and Servicing Segment increased $176.6 million to $362.1 million including additive net VIE eliminations of $186.1 million, from $185.5 million including additive net VIE eliminations of $181.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in other income was primarily due to (i) a $100.8 million increase in the change in value of net assets related to consolidated VIEs, (ii) a $53.9 million increase in earnings from an unconsolidated investor entity which owns equity in an online real estate company (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), (iii) a $22.8 million lesser decrease in fair value of servicing rights partially reflecting the effect of VIE eliminations on the expected amortization of this deteriorating asset net of increases in fair value due to the attainment of new servicing contracts, (iv) a $19.8 million gain on sale of five operating properties, all partially offset by (v) a $9.6 million lesser increase in the fair value of our conduit loans held-for-sale. The change in net assets related to consolidated VIEs reflects amounts associated with the Investing and Servicing Segment's variable interests in CMBS trusts it consolidates, including special servicing fees, interest income, and changes in fair value of CMBS and servicing rights. As noted above, this number is merely a function of the number of CMBS trusts consolidated in any given period, and as such, is not a meaningful indicator of the operating results for this segment. Before VIE eliminations, there was an increase in fair value of CMBS securities of $54.3 million and a decrease of $44.1 million in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nIncome Tax Provision\nHistorically, our consolidated income tax provision principally relates to the taxable nature of the Investing and Servicing Segment's loan servicing and loan conduit businesses which are housed in TRSs. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our income tax provision increased $23.2 million to $31.5 million, compared to $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change primarily reflects (i) an increase in the taxable income of our TRSs associated with earnings from our interest in an investor entity which owns equity in an online real estate company and sold nearly all of its interest during the year ended December 31, 2017 and (ii) an income tax provision of $10.4 million resulting from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets upon enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 (see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nCorporate\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, corporate expenses increased $22.3 million to $253.5 million, compared to $231.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to (i) a $17.9 million increase in interest expense principally on our 2021 Senior Notes issued in December 2016 and our 2025 Senior Notes issued in December 2017, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on our reduced term loan borrowings and our 2017 Convertible Notes which matured in October 2017, and (ii) a $5.0 million increase in management fees.\nOther Loss\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, corporate other loss increased $2.1 million to $6.6 million, compared to $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in corporate other loss was primarily due to (i) a $2.5 million decrease in other income, which included a reimbursement received related to a partnership guarantee arrangement in 2016, and (ii) a $2.4 million loss on an interest rate swap used to hedge the portion of our 2025 Senior Notes used to repay variable-rate secured financing, partially offset by (iii) a $2.8 million decreased loss on extinguishment of debt (see Notes 10 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nLending Segment\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, revenues of our Lending Segment decreased $31.7 million to $497.7 million, compared to $529.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to (i) a $20.8 million decrease in interest income from investment securities principally due to maturities during 2015 of two preferred equity interests we held in companies that own commercial real estate, the absence of $5.4 million of income realized upon the collection of an RMBS in 2015 and the absence of a $5.3 million CMBS prepayment fee recognized in 2015 and (ii) a $10.9 million decrease in interest income from loans principally due to a gradual decline of interest rate spreads and lower average loan balances during 2016, the effects of which were partially offset by higher loan fee income from increased levels of loan prepayments in 2016.\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, costs and expenses of our Lending Segment increased $7.4 million to $113.7 million, compared to $106.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to a $6.3 million increase in interest expense associated with the various secured financing facilities used to fund a portion of our investment portfolio and a $3.8 million increase in our loan loss allowance, partially offset by a $3.2 million decrease in G&A expenses primarily due to lower compensation costs.\nNet Interest Income (amounts in thousands)\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net interest income of our Lending Segment decreased $38.0 million to $408.7 million, compared to $446.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease reflects the net decrease in interest income explained in the Revenues discussion above and the increase in interest expense on our secured financing facilities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the weighted average unlevered yields on the Lending Segment's loans and investment securities were 7.5% and 8.0%, respectively. The decrease in the weighted average unlevered yield is primarily due to a gradual decline of interest rate spreads during 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Lending Segment's weighted average secured borrowing rates, inclusive of interest rate hedging costs and the amortization of deferred financing fees, were 3.4% and 3.2%, respectively, and 3.3% and 2.9%, respectively, excluding the impact of bridge financing. The increases in the Lending Segment's weighted average secured borrowing rates are primarily due to increases in LIBOR.\nOther Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, other income of our Lending Segment increased $6.3 million to $9.2 million, compared to $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to a $10.8 million increase in derivative gains, partially offset by a $3.9 million decrease in net gains from other investments. The $10.8 million increase in derivative gains reflects a $6.8 million increased gain on foreign currency hedges and a $4.0 million decreased loss on interest rate swaps. The foreign currency hedges are used to fix the U.S. dollar amounts of cash flows (both interest and principal payments) we expect to receive from our foreign currency denominated loans and CMBS investments. The gains on those hedges reflected the overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar in 2016. The interest rate swaps are used primarily to fix our interest rate payments on certain variable rate borrowings which fund fixed rate investments.\nProperty Segment\nChange in Results by Portfolio (amounts in thousands)\n\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, revenues of our Property Segment increased $89.2 million to $114.6 million, compared to $25.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in revenues was primarily due to increases in rental income of $76.2 million from our Woodstar Portfolio, which we acquired after September 30, 2015, and $12.5 million from our Ireland Portfolio.\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, costs and expenses of our Property Segment increased $95.7 million to $131.9 million, compared to $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in costs and expenses was primarily due to increases of $35.6 million in depreciation and amortization, $42.0 million in other rental related costs and $16.4 million in interest expense primarily on the secured financing for the Woodstar and Ireland Portfolios.\nOther Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, other income of our Property Segment increased $35.6 million to $52.3 million, compared to $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in other income was primarily due to (i) a $28.4 million increase in derivative gains primarily relating to interest rate swaps entered into in anticipation\nof debt financing for the acquisition of the Medical Office Portfolio and (ii) the recognition of an $8.4 million bargain purchase gain on the final two properties we purchased for the Woodstar Portfolio during the second quarter of 2016.\nInvesting and Servicing Segment and VIEs\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, revenues of our Investing and Servicing Segment decreased $8.7 million to $172.3 million after consolidated VIE eliminations of $180.5 million, compared to $181.0 million after consolidated VIE eliminations of $230.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The VIE eliminations are merely a function of the number of CMBS trusts consolidated in any given period, and as such, are not a meaningful indicator of the operating results for this segment. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to decreases of $28.5 million in servicing fees, $5.4 million in other fee income and $2.0 million in interest income from CMBS investments, partially offset by an increase of $27.0 million in rental income on our expanded REIS Equity Portfolio. The $2.0 million decrease in CMBS interest income reflects a $7.7 million decrease in VIE eliminations related to the CMBS trusts we consolidate. Excluding the effect of these eliminations, CMBS interest income decreased by $9.7 million, primarily reflecting a lower level of CMBS interest recoveries.\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, costs and expenses of our Investing and Servicing Segment increased $16.2 million to $174.2 million, compared to $158.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, inclusive of VIE eliminations, which were nominal for both periods. The increase in costs and expenses was primarily due to increases of $11.5 million in costs of rental operations and $5.1 million in interest expense on secured financings for CMBS and the REIS Equity Portfolio.\nOther Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, other income of our Investing and Servicing Segment decreased $70.6 million to $185.5 million including additive net VIE eliminations of $181.2 million, from $256.1 million including additive net VIE eliminations of $232.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in other income was primarily due to (i) a decrease of $33.9 million in the change in value of net assets related to consolidated VIEs, (ii) a $34.5 million greater reduction in fair value of servicing rights which reflects the expected amortization of this deteriorating asset net of increases in fair value due to the attainment of new servicing contracts, (iii) the absence of a $17.8 million gain on sale of a commercial real estate asset realized in 2015 and (iv) a $4.3 million unfavorable change in fair value of CMBS securities, all partially offset by (v) a $9.9 million greater increase in fair value of loans held-for-sale and (vi) a $9.9 million lower loss on derivatives which principally hedge our interest rate risk on those loans. The change in net assets related to consolidated VIEs reflects amounts associated with the Investing and Servicing Segment's variable interests in CMBS trusts it consolidates, including special servicing fees, interest income, and changes in fair value of CMBS and servicing rights. As noted above, this number is merely a function of the number of CMBS trusts consolidated in any given period, and as such, is not a meaningful indicator of the operating results for this segment. Before VIE eliminations, there were decreases in fair value of CMBS securities of $44.1 million and $10.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nIncome Tax Provision\nHistorically, our consolidated income tax provision principally relates to the taxable nature of the Investing and Servicing Segment's loan servicing and loan conduit businesses which are housed in TRSs. Our tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2016, as well as the overall effective tax rate, is lower than for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to a decrease in the taxable income of our TRSs.\nCorporate\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, corporate expenses decreased $4.5 million to $231.2 million, compared to $235.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.2 million decrease in management fees partially offset by a $3.7 million increase in other corporate expenses, including acquisition and investment pursuit costs.\nOther Loss\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, corporate other loss decreased $1.4 million to $4.5 million, compared to $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was due to a $4.3 million increase in other income, including reimbursements received in 2016 related to a partnership guarantee arrangement, partially offset by a $2.9 million increase in loss on extinguishment of debt.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nCore Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure. We calculate Core Earnings as GAAP net income (loss) excluding the following:\n (i) non-cash equity compensation expense; \n (ii) incentive fees due under our management agreement; \n\n (iv) acquisition costs associated with successful acquisitions; and \n (v) any unrealized gains, losses or other non-cash items recorded in net income for the period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income. \nThe repurchase of our 2018 Notes in March 2017 was considered to be an unrealized event for Core Earnings purposes because the 2018 Notes were effectively exchanged for the 2023 Notes, thereby simply extending the term of this debt. As such, consistent with the above definition, we have deferred the $5.9 million GAAP loss on extinguishment of debt included in our GAAP results for the year ended December 31, 2017 and will amortize this loss over the term of our 2023 Notes.\nWe believe that Core Earnings provides an additional measure of our core operating performance by eliminating the impact of certain non-cash expenses and facilitating a comparison of our financial results to those of other comparable REITs with fewer or no non-cash adjustments and comparison of our own operating results from period to period. Our management uses Core Earnings in this way, and also uses Core Earnings to compute the incentive fee due under our management agreement. The Company believes that its investors also use Core Earnings or a comparable supplemental performance measure to evaluate and compare the performance of the Company and its peers, and as such, the Company believes that the disclosure of Core Earnings is useful to (and expected by) its investors.\nHowever, the Company cautions that Core Earnings does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), or an indication of our cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), a measure of our liquidity, or an indication of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition, our methodology for calculating Core Earnings may differ from the methodologies employed by other REITs to calculate the same or similar supplemental performance measures, and accordingly, our reported Core Earnings may not be comparable to the Core Earnings reported by other REITs.\nIn assessing the appropriate weighted average diluted share count to apply to Core Earnings for purposes of determining Core Earnings per share ( EPS\u201d), management considered the following attributes of our current GAAP diluted share methodology: (i) our unvested stock awards representing participating securities were determined to be anti-dilutive and were thus excluded from the denominator of the EPS calculation; and (ii) the portion of the convertible senior notes that are in-the-money\u201d (referred to as the conversion spread value\u201d), representing the value that would be delivered to investors in shares upon an assumed conversion, is included in the denominator. Because compensation expense related to unvested stock awards is added back for Core Earnings purposes pursuant to the definition above, there is no dilution to Core Earnings resulting from the associated expense recognition. As a result, for purposes of determining Core EPS, our GAAP EPS methodology was adjusted to include (instead of exclude) such unvested awards. Further, conversion of the convertible senior notes is an event that is contingent upon numerous factors, none of which are in our control, and is an event that may or may not occur. Consistent with the treatment of other unrealized adjustments to Core Earnings, our GAAP EPS methodology was adjusted to exclude (instead of include) the conversion spread value in determining Core EPS until a conversion actually occurs. The following table presents our diluted weighted average shares used in our GAAP EPS calculation reconciled to our diluted weighted average shares used in our Core EPS calculation (amounts in thousands):\n\nThe definition of Core Earnings allows management to make adjustments, subject to the approval of a majority of our independent directors, in situations where such adjustments are considered appropriate in order for Core Earnings to be calculated in a manner consistent with its definition and objective. No adjustments to the definition of Core Earnings occurred during the year ended December 31, 2017. However, as a reminder, in 2015, we adjusted the calculation of Core Earnings related to the equity component of our convertible notes. We amortize the equity component of these instruments through interest expense. The amount is not considered realized until the earlier of (a) the entire issuance of the notes has been extinguished; or (b) the equity portion has been fully amortized. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the 2017 Notes matured and the equity portion of these notes had been fully amortized. As a result, we reflected $15.2 million as a positive adjustment to Core Earnings, representing the $15.6 million equity balance recognized upon issuance of the 2017 Notes, net of $0.4 million in adjustments related to cumulative repurchases through the maturity date.\nIn February 2018, our board of directors approved an amendment (the Amendment\u201d) to our management agreement which, among other things, amends the definition of Core Earnings and the calculation of Incentive Compensation, both as defined. The intent of the Amendment is to treat subsidiary equity in the same manner as if parent equity had been issued. In the case of the DownREIT Portfolio, any distributions that accrue to the holders of the Class A Units are reflected as a reduction to net income attributable to non-controlling interests within our GAAP consolidated statements of operations. The Amendment adjusts the definition of Core Earnings so that any reductions to GAAP net income for such distributions are added back. Further, the redeemable Class A Units are only reflected in our GAAP diluted share count to the extent they are dilutive. The Amendment adjusts the definition of Incentive Compensation so that all Class A units issued are included in the denominator for purposes of determining whether the hurdle rate has been met. The Amendment is effective December 28, 2017, and as a result, the impact to both Core Earnings and the incentive fee for the year ended December 31, 2017 was insignificant.\nThe following table summarizes our quarterly Core Earnings per weighted average diluted share for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\n\nThe following table presents our summarized results of operations and reconciliation to Core Earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017, by business segment (amounts in thousands):\n\nThe following table presents our summarized results of operations and reconciliation to Core Earnings for the year ended December 31, 2016, by business segment (amounts in thousands):\n\nThe following table presents our summarized results of operations and reconciliation to Core Earnings for the year ended December 31, 2015, by business segment (amounts in thousands):\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nLending Segment\nThe Lending Segment's Core Earnings increased by $26.5 million, from $393.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 to $420.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. After making adjustments for the calculation of Core Earnings, revenues were $547.0 million, costs and expenses were $128.3 million and other income was $2.9 million.\nCore revenues, consisting principally of interest income on loans, increased by $50.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to higher average loan balances and LIBOR rates, partially offset by lower levels of prepayment related income.\nCore costs and expenses increased by $21.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to (i) a $19.2 million increase in interest expense associated with the various secured financing facilities used to fund a\nportion of our investment portfolio and (ii) a $1.3 million increase in general and administrative expenses.\nCore other income decreased by $0.9 million.\nProperty Segment\nCore Earnings by Portfolio (amounts in thousands)\n ", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of the Company should be read in conjunction with Item 6, Selected Financial Data,\u201d and our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this Form 10-K\u201d). Certain statements we make under this Item 7 constitute forward-looking statements\u201d under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d preceding Part I of this Form 10-K. You should consider our forward-looking statements in light of our Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC.\nBusiness Objectives and Outlook\nOur objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our investors over the long-term, primarily through dividends and secondarily through capital appreciation. We intend to achieve our objective by originating and acquiring target assets to create a diversified investment portfolio that is financed in a manner that is designed to deliver attractive returns across a variety of market conditions and economic cycles. We are focused on our three core competencies: transaction access, asset analysis and selection, and identification of attractive relative values within the real estate debt and equity markets.\nSince our IPO in August 2009, we have evolved from a company focused on opportunistic acquisitions of real estate debt assets from distressed sellers to that of a full-service real estate finance platform that is primarily focused on the origination and acquisition of commercial real estate debt and equity investments across the capital structure, in both the U.S. and Europe. With the Starwood brand, market presence, and lending/asset management platform that we have developed, we are focused primarily on the following opportunities:\n (1) Continue to expand our market presence as a leading provider of acquisition, refinance, development and expansion capital to large real estate projects (greater than $75 million) in infill locations, and other attractive market niches where our size and scale give us an advantage to provide a one-stop\u201d lending solution for real estate developers, owners and operators; \n (2) Continue to expand our investment activities in subordinate CMBS and revenues from special servicing; \n (3) Continue to expand our capabilities in syndication and securitization, which serve as a source of attractively priced, matched-term financing; \n (4) Continue to leverage our Investing and Servicing Segment's sourcing and credit underwriting capabilities to expand our overall footprint in the commercial real estate debt markets; and \n (5) Expand our investment activities in both (i) targeted real estate equity investments and (ii) residential mortgage finance. \nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to find appropriate investment opportunities.\nRecent Developments\nDevelopments During the Fourth Quarter of 2017\nDownREIT Portfolio Acquisition\nOn December 21, 2017, we entered into an agreement to acquire a 27-property, 6,109 unit, 99% occupied affordable housing portfolio located in Central and South Florida for $594.7 million, which includes $40.0 million of contingent consideration (the DownREIT Portfolio\u201d). On December 28, 2017, we acquired eight of these affordable housing communities (the First Closing\u201d), which include 1,740 units, for $156.2 million, including contingent consideration of $10.8 million. We financed the First Closing utilizing 10-year mortgage debt totaling $116.7 million with a fixed 3.81% interest rate.\nOther Developments\n \u00b7 The Lending Segment originated or acquired the following loans during the quarter: \n o $345.0 million first mortgage loan for the refinancing of a loan originated by the Company in 2014 on a 57-story Class A+ office and condominium tower located in San Francisco, California, of which the Company funded $214.5 million. The office portion of the tower is fully leased to a premier global online social media and networking company. \n o \u00a3227.6 million first mortgage loan for the acquisition of 14 assisted living facilities located across the United Kingdom, of which the Company funded \u00a3208.1 million. \n o $200.0 million first mortgage participation for the development of a 1.2 million square foot residential tower located in Midtown Manhattan, of which the Company funded $52.2 million. \n o $183.0 million first mortgage and mezzanine loan for the refinancing of a loan originated by the Company in 2015 on a 1,250-room luxury hotel located in Atlanta, Georgia, which was fully funded upon origination. \n o $125.0 million first mortgage and mezzanine loan for the development of a mixed-use development, consisting of a residential tower, hotel, ground floor retail, and parking garage, located in Coral Gables, Florida.

the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues of our Lending Segment increased $50.2 million to $547.9 million, compared to $497.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to an\nincrease in interest income from loans principally due to higher average loan balances and LIBOR rates, partially offset by lower levels of prepayment related income.\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, costs and expenses of our Lending Segment increased $13.3 million to $127.1 million, compared to $113.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to (i) a $19.2 million increase in interest expense associated with the various secured financing facilities used to fund a portion of our investment portfolio and (ii) a $3.3 million increase in general, administrative and other expenses, partially offset by (iii) a $9.2 million decrease in our loan loss allowance.\nNet Interest Income (amounts in thousands)\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest income from loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n499,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n449,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n50,336\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest income from investment securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n46,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n47,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(531)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(107,167)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(88,000)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(19,167)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n439,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n408,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n30,638\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net interest income of our Lending Segment increased $30.6 million to $439.3 million, compared to $408.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase reflects the increase in interest income explained in the Revenues discussion above, partially offset by the increase in interest expense on our secured financing facilities.\nDuring each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the weighted average unlevered yield on the Lending Segment's loans and investment securities was 7.5%. The weighted average unlevered yield remained unchanged primarily due to the benefits of increases in LIBOR which offset lower levels of prepayment related income and declines in interest rate spreads for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Lending Segment's weighted average secured borrowing rates, inclusive of interest rate hedging costs and the amortization of deferred financing fees, were 3.8% and 3.4%, respectively, and 3.7% and 3.3%, respectively, excluding the impact of bridge financing. The increases in borrowing rates primarily reflect increases in LIBOR.\nOther Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, other income of our Lending Segment decreased $5.1 million to $4.1 million, compared to $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a $76.8 million unfavorable change in gain (loss) on derivatives, partially offset by a $71.2 million favorable change in foreign currency gain (loss). The unfavorable change from derivatives reflects a $77.6 million unfavorable change on foreign currency hedges, partially offset by a $0.8 million decreased loss on interest rate swaps. The foreign currency hedges are used to fix the U.S. dollar amounts of cash flows (both interest and principal payments) we expect to receive from our foreign currency denominated loans and CMBS investments. The unfavorable change on the foreign currency hedges and the favorable change in foreign currency gain (loss) reflect the overall weakening of the U.S. dollar against the GBP in the year ended December 31, 2017 versus a strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the year ended December 31, 2016. The interest rate swaps are used primarily to fix our interest rate payments on certain variable rate borrowings which fund fixed rate investments.\nProperty Segment\nChange in Results by Portfolio (amounts in thousands)\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ Change from prior year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCost and expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOther income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMaster Lease Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n13,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(2,354)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,536\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMedical Office Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n65,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n66,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(25,443)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(26,525)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIreland Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(37,882)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(37,384)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWoodstar Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(11,288)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(9,102)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,184\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDownREIT Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(88)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvestment in unconsolidated entities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(37,422)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(37,426)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther/Corporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(620)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n84,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n65,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(112,196)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(93,323)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the above-referenced Property Segment portfolios.\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues of our Property Segment increased $84.5 million to $199.1 million, compared to $114.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in revenues in the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the full period inclusion of rental income for the Medical Office Portfolio, which was acquired in December 2016, and the Woodstar Portfolio, which was acquired over a period from October 2015 through April 2016. Also contributing to the increase was rental income from the Master Lease Portfolio which was acquired on September 25, 2017. The DownREIT Portfolio was acquired on December 28, 2017, so had little impact on revenues.\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, costs and expenses of our Property Segment increased $65.6 million to $197.5 million, compared to $131.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in costs and expenses reflects increases of $22.9 million in depreciation and amortization, $24.7 million in other rental related costs and $24.5 million in interest expense, all primarily due to the full period inclusion of the Medical Office Portfolio and Woodstar Portfolio and acquisition of the Master Lease Portfolio, partially offset by lower amortization related to the Woodstar Portfolio's in-place lease intangible asset, which is now fully amortized, and a $7.5 million decrease in acquisition costs not capitalized.\nOther Income (Loss)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, other income (loss) of our Property Segment decreased $112.2 million to a loss of $59.9 million, compared to income of $52.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in other income (loss) was primarily due to (i) a $65.8 million unfavorable change in gain (loss) on derivatives of which $38.7 million related to foreign exchange contracts which economically hedge our Euro currency exposure with respect to the Ireland Portfolio and $27.1 million related to interest rate swaps which primarily hedge the variable interest rate risk on borrowings secured by our Medical Office Portfolio, (ii) a $37.4 million unfavorable change in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities due to decreases in fair value of the properties in the Retail Fund (see Notes 8 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and (iii) the non-recurrence of an $8.4 million bargain purchase gain recognized on the Woodstar Portfolio in the second quarter of 2016.\nInvesting and Servicing Segment and VIEs\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues of our Investing and Servicing Segment decreased $39.4 million to $132.9 million after consolidated VIE eliminations of $179.4 million, compared to $172.3 million after consolidated VIE eliminations of $180.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The VIE eliminations are merely a function of the number of CMBS trusts consolidated in any given period, and as such, are not a meaningful indicator of the operating results for this segment. The decrease in revenues in the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to decreases of $27.4 million in servicing fees and $17.5 million in interest income from CMBS investments, partially offset by a $12.3 million increase in rental income on our expanded REIS Equity Portfolio. The $27.4 million decrease in servicing fees is primarily due to the divestiture of our European servicing and advisory business in October 2016 and lower domestic servicing fees. The $17.5 million decrease in CMBS interest income reflects a $5.6 million increase in VIE eliminations related to the CMBS trusts we consolidate. Excluding the effect of these eliminations, CMBS interest income decreased by $11.9 million, reflecting a lower level of CMBS interest recoveries from asset liquidations by CMBS trusts.\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, costs and expenses of our Investing and Servicing Segment decreased $17.1 million to $157.1 million, compared to $174.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, inclusive of VIE eliminations which were nominal for both periods. The decrease in costs and expenses was primarily due to a $26.9 million decrease in general and administrative expenses principally reflecting the divestiture of our European servicing and advisory business and lower compensation costs, partially offset by increases of $4.4 million in costs of rental operations, $3.9 million in depreciation and amortization and $3.2 million in interest expense, all primarily related to our expanded REIS Equity Portfolio.\nOther Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, other income of our Investing and Servicing Segment increased $176.6 million to $362.1 million including additive net VIE eliminations of $186.1 million, from $185.5 million including additive net VIE eliminations of $181.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in other income was primarily due to (i) a $100.8 million increase in the change in value of net assets related to consolidated VIEs, (ii) a $53.9 million increase in earnings from an unconsolidated investor entity which owns equity in an online real estate company (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), (iii) a $22.8 million lesser decrease in fair value of servicing rights partially reflecting the effect of VIE eliminations on the expected amortization of this deteriorating asset net of increases in fair value due to the attainment of new servicing contracts, (iv) a $19.8 million gain on sale of five operating properties, all partially offset by (v) a $9.6 million lesser increase in the fair value of our conduit loans held-for-sale. The change in net assets related to consolidated VIEs reflects amounts associated with the Investing and Servicing Segment's variable interests in CMBS trusts it consolidates, including special servicing fees, interest income, and changes in fair value of CMBS and servicing rights. As noted above, this number is merely a function of the number of CMBS trusts consolidated in any given period, and as such, is not a meaningful indicator of the operating results for this segment. Before VIE eliminations, there was an increase in fair value of CMBS securities of $54.3 million and a decrease of $44.1 million in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nIncome Tax Provision\nHistorically, our consolidated income tax provision principally relates to the taxable nature of the Investing and Servicing Segment's loan servicing and loan conduit businesses which are housed in TRSs. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our income tax provision increased $23.2 million to $31.5 million, compared to $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change primarily reflects (i) an increase in the taxable income of our TRSs associated with earnings from our interest in an investor entity which owns equity in an online real estate company and sold nearly all of its interest during the year ended December 31, 2017 and (ii) an income tax provision of $10.4 million resulting from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets upon enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 (see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nCorporate\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, corporate expenses increased $22.3 million to $253.5 million, compared to $231.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to (i) a $17.9 million increase in interest expense principally on our 2021 Senior Notes issued in December 2016 and our 2025 Senior Notes issued in December 2017, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on our reduced term loan borrowings and our 2017 Convertible Notes which matured in October 2017, and (ii) a $5.0 million increase in management fees.\nOther Loss\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, corporate other loss increased $2.1 million to $6.6 million, compared to $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in corporate other loss was primarily due to (i) a $2.5 million decrease in other income, which included a reimbursement received related to a partnership guarantee arrangement in 2016, and (ii) a $2.4 million loss on an interest rate swap used to hedge the portion of our 2025 Senior Notes used to repay variable-rate secured financing, partially offset by (iii) a $2.8 million decreased loss on extinguishment of debt (see Notes 10 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nLending Segment\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, revenues of our Lending Segment decreased $31.7 million to $497.7 million, compared to $529.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to (i) a $20.8 million decrease in interest income from investment securities principally due to maturities during 2015 of two preferred equity interests we held in companies that own commercial real estate, the absence of $5.4 million of income realized upon the collection of an RMBS in 2015 and the absence of a $5.3 million CMBS prepayment fee recognized in 2015 and (ii) a $10.9 million decrease in interest income from loans principally due to a gradual decline of interest rate spreads and lower average loan balances during 2016, the effects of which were partially offset by higher loan fee income from increased levels of loan prepayments in 2016.\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, costs and expenses of our Lending Segment increased $7.4 million to $113.7 million, compared to $106.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to a $6.3 million increase in interest expense associated with the various secured financing facilities used to fund a portion of our investment portfolio and a $3.8 million increase in our loan loss allowance, partially offset by a $3.2 million decrease in G&A expenses primarily due to lower compensation costs.\nNet Interest Income (amounts in thousands)\nTable 171: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest income from loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n449,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n460,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(10,895)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest income from investment securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n47,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n68,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(20,818)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(88,000)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(81,676)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6,324)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n408,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n446,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(38,037)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net interest income of our Lending Segment decreased $38.0 million to $408.7 million, compared to $446.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease reflects the net decrease in interest income explained in the Revenues discussion above and the increase in interest expense on our secured financing facilities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the weighted average unlevered yields on the Lending Segment's loans and investment securities were 7.5% and 8.0%, respectively. The decrease in the weighted average unlevered yield is primarily due to a gradual decline of interest rate spreads during 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Lending Segment's weighted average secured borrowing rates, inclusive of interest rate hedging costs and the amortization of deferred financing fees, were 3.4% and 3.2%, respectively, and 3.3% and 2.9%, respectively, excluding the impact of bridge financing. The increases in the Lending Segment's weighted average secured borrowing rates are primarily due to increases in LIBOR.\nOther Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, other income of our Lending Segment increased $6.3 million to $9.2 million, compared to $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to a $10.8 million increase in derivative gains, partially offset by a $3.9 million decrease in net gains from other investments. The $10.8 million increase in derivative gains reflects a $6.8 million increased gain on foreign currency hedges and a $4.0 million decreased loss on interest rate swaps. The foreign currency hedges are used to fix the U.S. dollar amounts of cash flows (both interest and principal payments) we expect to receive from our foreign currency denominated loans and CMBS investments. The gains on those hedges reflected the overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar in 2016. The interest rate swaps are used primarily to fix our interest rate payments on certain variable rate borrowings which fund fixed rate investments.\nProperty Segment\nChange in Results by Portfolio (amounts in thousands)\nTable 172: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ Change from prior year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCost and expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOther income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMedical Office Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n25,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n18,467\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIreland Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,154\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWoodstar Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n76,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n81,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,728\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvestment in unconsolidated entities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(354)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(354)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther/Corporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(76)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(31)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n89,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n95,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n35,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n29,040\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, revenues of our Property Segment increased $89.2 million to $114.6 million, compared to $25.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in revenues was primarily due to increases in rental income of $76.2 million from our Woodstar Portfolio, which we acquired after September 30, 2015, and $12.5 million from our Ireland Portfolio.\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, costs and expenses of our Property Segment increased $95.7 million to $131.9 million, compared to $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in costs and expenses was primarily due to increases of $35.6 million in depreciation and amortization, $42.0 million in other rental related costs and $16.4 million in interest expense primarily on the secured financing for the Woodstar and Ireland Portfolios.\nOther Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, other income of our Property Segment increased $35.6 million to $52.3 million, compared to $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in other income was primarily due to (i) a $28.4 million increase in derivative gains primarily relating to interest rate swaps entered into in anticipation\nof debt financing for the acquisition of the Medical Office Portfolio and (ii) the recognition of an $8.4 million bargain purchase gain on the final two properties we purchased for the Woodstar Portfolio during the second quarter of 2016.\nInvesting and Servicing Segment and VIEs\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, revenues of our Investing and Servicing Segment decreased $8.7 million to $172.3 million after consolidated VIE eliminations of $180.5 million, compared to $181.0 million after consolidated VIE eliminations of $230.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The VIE eliminations are merely a function of the number of CMBS trusts consolidated in any given period, and as such, are not a meaningful indicator of the operating results for this segment. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to decreases of $28.5 million in servicing fees, $5.4 million in other fee income and $2.0 million in interest income from CMBS investments, partially offset by an increase of $27.0 million in rental income on our expanded REIS Equity Portfolio. The $2.0 million decrease in CMBS interest income reflects a $7.7 million decrease in VIE eliminations related to the CMBS trusts we consolidate. Excluding the effect of these eliminations, CMBS interest income decreased by $9.7 million, primarily reflecting a lower level of CMBS interest recoveries.\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, costs and expenses of our Investing and Servicing Segment increased $16.2 million to $174.2 million, compared to $158.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, inclusive of VIE eliminations, which were nominal for both periods. The increase in costs and expenses was primarily due to increases of $11.5 million in costs of rental operations and $5.1 million in interest expense on secured financings for CMBS and the REIS Equity Portfolio.\nOther Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, other income of our Investing and Servicing Segment decreased $70.6 million to $185.5 million including additive net VIE eliminations of $181.2 million, from $256.1 million including additive net VIE eliminations of $232.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in other income was primarily due to (i) a decrease of $33.9 million in the change in value of net assets related to consolidated VIEs, (ii) a $34.5 million greater reduction in fair value of servicing rights which reflects the expected amortization of this deteriorating asset net of increases in fair value due to the attainment of new servicing contracts, (iii) the absence of a $17.8 million gain on sale of a commercial real estate asset realized in 2015 and (iv) a $4.3 million unfavorable change in fair value of CMBS securities, all partially offset by (v) a $9.9 million greater increase in fair value of loans held-for-sale and (vi) a $9.9 million lower loss on derivatives which principally hedge our interest rate risk on those loans. The change in net assets related to consolidated VIEs reflects amounts associated with the Investing and Servicing Segment's variable interests in CMBS trusts it consolidates, including special servicing fees, interest income, and changes in fair value of CMBS and servicing rights. As noted above, this number is merely a function of the number of CMBS trusts consolidated in any given period, and as such, is not a meaningful indicator of the operating results for this segment. Before VIE eliminations, there were decreases in fair value of CMBS securities of $44.1 million and $10.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nIncome Tax Provision\nHistorically, our consolidated income tax provision principally relates to the taxable nature of the Investing and Servicing Segment's loan servicing and loan conduit businesses which are housed in TRSs. Our tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2016, as well as the overall effective tax rate, is lower than for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to a decrease in the taxable income of our TRSs.\nCorporate\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, corporate expenses decreased $4.5 million to $231.2 million, compared to $235.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.2 million decrease in management fees partially offset by a $3.7 million increase in other corporate expenses, including acquisition and investment pursuit costs.\nOther Loss\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, corporate other loss decreased $1.4 million to $4.5 million, compared to $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was due to a $4.3 million increase in other income, including reimbursements received in 2016 related to a partnership guarantee arrangement, partially offset by a $2.9 million increase in loss on extinguishment of debt.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nCore Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure. We calculate Core Earnings as GAAP net income (loss) excluding the following:\n (i) non-cash equity compensation expense; \n (ii) incentive fees due under our management agreement; \nTable 175: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(iii)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ndepreciation and amortization of real estate and associated intangibles;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (iv) acquisition costs associated with successful acquisitions; and \n (v) any unrealized gains, losses or other non-cash items recorded in net income for the period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income. \nThe repurchase of our 2018 Notes in March 2017 was considered to be an unrealized event for Core Earnings purposes because the 2018 Notes were effectively exchanged for the 2023 Notes, thereby simply extending the term of this debt. As such, consistent with the above definition, we have deferred the $5.9 million GAAP loss on extinguishment of debt included in our GAAP results for the year ended December 31, 2017 and will amortize this loss over the term of our 2023 Notes.\nWe believe that Core Earnings provides an additional measure of our core operating performance by eliminating the impact of certain non-cash expenses and facilitating a comparison of our financial results to those of other comparable REITs with fewer or no non-cash adjustments and comparison of our own operating results from period to period. Our management uses Core Earnings in this way, and also uses Core Earnings to compute the incentive fee due under our management agreement. The Company believes that its investors also use Core Earnings or a comparable supplemental performance measure to evaluate and compare the performance of the Company and its peers, and as such, the Company believes that the disclosure of Core Earnings is useful to (and expected by) its investors.\nHowever, the Company cautions that Core Earnings does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), or an indication of our cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), a measure of our liquidity, or an indication of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition, our methodology for calculating Core Earnings may differ from the methodologies employed by other REITs to calculate the same or similar supplemental performance measures, and accordingly, our reported Core Earnings may not be comparable to the Core Earnings reported by other REITs.\nIn assessing the appropriate weighted average diluted share count to apply to Core Earnings for purposes of determining Core Earnings per share ( EPS\u201d), management considered the following attributes of our current GAAP diluted share methodology: (i) our unvested stock awards representing participating securities were determined to be anti-dilutive and were thus excluded from the denominator of the EPS calculation; and (ii) the portion of the convertible senior notes that are in-the-money\u201d (referred to as the conversion spread value\u201d), representing the value that would be delivered to investors in shares upon an assumed conversion, is included in the denominator. Because compensation expense related to unvested stock awards is added back for Core Earnings purposes pursuant to the definition above, there is no dilution to Core Earnings resulting from the associated expense recognition. As a result, for purposes of determining Core EPS, our GAAP EPS methodology was adjusted to include (instead of exclude) such unvested awards. Further, conversion of the convertible senior notes is an event that is contingent upon numerous factors, none of which are in our control, and is an event that may or may not occur. Consistent with the treatment of other unrealized adjustments to Core Earnings, our GAAP EPS methodology was adjusted to exclude (instead of include) the conversion spread value in determining Core EPS until a conversion actually occurs. The following table presents our diluted weighted average shares used in our GAAP EPS calculation reconciled to our diluted weighted average shares used in our Core EPS calculation (amounts in thousands):\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDiluted weighted average shares - GAAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n262,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n241,794\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n234,142\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdd: Unvested stock awards\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,132\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLess: Conversion spread value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,899)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,697)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(97)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDiluted weighted average shares - Core\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n261,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n240,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n236,177\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe definition of Core Earnings allows management to make adjustments, subject to the approval of a majority of our independent directors, in situations where such adjustments are considered appropriate in order for Core Earnings to be calculated in a manner consistent with its definition and objective. No adjustments to the definition of Core Earnings occurred during the year ended December 31, 2017. However, as a reminder, in 2015, we adjusted the calculation of Core Earnings related to the equity component of our convertible notes. We amortize the equity component of these instruments through interest expense. The amount is not considered realized until the earlier of (a) the entire issuance of the notes has been extinguished; or (b) the equity portion has been fully amortized. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the 2017 Notes matured and the equity portion of these notes had been fully amortized. As a result, we reflected $15.2 million as a positive adjustment to Core Earnings, representing the $15.6 million equity balance recognized upon issuance of the 2017 Notes, net of $0.4 million in adjustments related to cumulative repurchases through the maturity date.\nIn February 2018, our board of directors approved an amendment (the Amendment\u201d) to our management agreement which, among other things, amends the definition of Core Earnings and the calculation of Incentive Compensation, both as defined. The intent of the Amendment is to treat subsidiary equity in the same manner as if parent equity had been issued. In the case of the DownREIT Portfolio, any distributions that accrue to the holders of the Class A Units are reflected as a reduction to net income attributable to non-controlling interests within our GAAP consolidated statements of operations. The Amendment adjusts the definition of Core Earnings so that any reductions to GAAP net income for such distributions are added back. Further, the redeemable Class A Units are only reflected in our GAAP diluted share count to the extent they are dilutive. The Amendment adjusts the definition of Incentive Compensation so that all Class A units issued are included in the denominator for purposes of determining whether the hurdle rate has been met. The Amendment is effective December 28, 2017, and as a result, the impact to both Core Earnings and the incentive fee for the year ended December 31, 2017 was insignificant.\nThe following table summarizes our quarterly Core Earnings per weighted average diluted share for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>
