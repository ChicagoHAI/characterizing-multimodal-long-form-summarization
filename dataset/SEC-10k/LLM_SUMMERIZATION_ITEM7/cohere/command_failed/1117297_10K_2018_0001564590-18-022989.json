The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in the sections titled Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors.\u201d\nManagement Overview\nWe are a leader in performance marketing products and technologies. We specialize in customer acquisition for clients in high value, information-intensive markets or verticals,\u201d including financial services, education, home services and business-to-business technology. Our clients include some of the world's largest companies and brands in those markets. While the majority of our operations and revenue are in North America, we also have emerging businesses in Brazil and India.\nWe deliver measurable and cost-effective marketing results to our clients, typically in the form of a qualified lead, inquiry, click, call, application, or customer. Leads, inquiries, clicks, calls, and applications can then convert into a customer or sale for clients at a rate that results in an acceptable marketing cost to them. We are typically paid by clients when we deliver qualified leads, inquiries, clicks, calls, applications, or customers as defined by our agreements with them. References to the delivery of customers means a sale or completed customer transaction (e.g., bound insurance policies or customer appointments with clients). Because we bear the costs of media, our programs must result in attractive marketing costs to our clients at media costs and margins that provide sound financial outcomes for us. To deliver leads, inquiries, clicks, calls, applications, and customers to our clients, generally we:\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> own or access targeted media through business arrangements (e.g., revenue sharing arrangements) or by purchasing media (e.g., clicks from major search engines);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> run advertisements or other forms of marketing messages and programs in that media to create visitor responses typically in the form of leads or inquiries (e.g., contact information), clicks (to further qualification or matching steps, or to online client applications or offerings), calls (to our owned and operated call centers or that of our clients or their agents), applications (e.g., for enrollment or a financial product), or customers (e.g., bound insurance policies);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> match these leads, inquiries, clicks, calls, applications, or customers to client offerings or brands that we believe can meet visitor interests or needs and client targets and requirements; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> optimize client matches and media costs such that we achieve desired results for clients and a sound financial outcome for us.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur primary financial objective has been and remains creating revenue growth from sustainable sources, at target levels of profitability. Our primary financial objective is not to maximize profits, but rather to achieve target levels of profitability while investing in various growth initiatives, as we continue to believe we are in the early stages of a large, long-term market opportunity.\nOur business derives its net revenue from fees earned through the delivery of qualified leads, inquiries, clicks, calls, applications, or customers and, to a lesser extent, display advertisements, or impressions. Through a vertical focus, targeted media presence and our technology platform, we are able to deliver targeted, measurable marketing results to our clients.\nOur two largest client verticals are financial services and education. Our financial services client vertical represented 70%, 62% and 52% of net revenue in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016. Our education client vertical represented 19%, 24% and 30% of net revenue in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016. Our other client vertical, consisting of home services and business-to-business technology, represented 11%, 14% and 18% of net revenue in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016. We generated the majority of our revenue from sales to clients in the United States.\nTrends Affecting our Business\nClient Verticals\nTo date, we have generated the majority of our revenue from clients in our financial services and education client verticals. We expect that a majority of our revenue in fiscal year 2019 will continue to be generated from clients in these two client verticals.\nOur financial services client vertical has been challenged by a number of factors in the past, including the limited availability of high quality media at acceptable margins caused by acquisition of media sources by competitors, increased competition for high quality media and changes in search engine algorithms. These effects may impact our business in the future again. To offset this impact, we have enhanced our product set to provide greater segmentation, matching, transparency and right pricing of media that have enabled better monetization to provide greater access to high quality media sources. Moreover, we have entered into strategic partnerships and acquisitions to increase and diversify our access to quality media and client budgets. Our financial services client vertical also benefits from more spending by clients in digital media and performance marketing as digital marketing continues to evolve.\nOur education client vertical has been significantly challenged by regulations and enforcement activity affecting U.S. for-profit education institutions over the past several years. For example, in July 2015, the Federal Trade Commission initiated an investigation of a publicly traded U.S. for-profit education client with respect to its recruiting and enrollment practices. These and other similar regulatory and enforcement activities have affected and are expected to continue to affect our clients' businesses and marketing practices, which have and may continue to, result in a decrease in these clients' spending with us and other vendors and fluctuations in the volume and mix of our business with these clients. To offset the impact these regulatory and investigative activities have had on the U.S. for-profit education clients, we have broadened our product set from our traditional lead business with the addition of better qualified and matched leads or inquiries, clicks and calls; we believe these new enhanced products better match U.S. for-profit education client needs in the current regulatory environment. We have also broadened our markets in education to include not-for-profit schools and international markets in Brazil and India. Moreover, we have entered into strategic partnerships to increase and diversify our access to quality media and client budgets.\nDevelopment, Acquisition and Retention of High Quality Targeted Media\nOne of the primary challenges of our business is finding or creating media that is high quality and targeted enough to attract prospects for our clients at costs that provide a sound financial outcome for us. In order to grow our business, we must be able to find, develop and retain quality targeted media on a cost-effective basis. Consolidation of media sources, changes in search engine algorithms and increased competition for available media has, during some periods, limited and may continue to limit our ability to generate revenue at acceptable margins. To offset this impact, we have developed new sources of media, including entering into strategic partnerships with other marketing and media companies and acquisitions. Such partnerships include takeovers of performance marketing functions for large web media properties; backend monetization of unmatched traffic for clients with large media buys; and white label products for other performance marketing companies. We have also focused on growing our revenue from email, mobile and social media traffic sources.\nSeasonality\nOur results are subject to significant fluctuation as a result of seasonality. In particular, our quarters ending December 31 (our second fiscal quarter) are typically characterized by seasonal weakness. In our second fiscal quarters, there is lower availability of lead supply from some forms of media during the holiday period on a cost effective basis and some of our clients have lower budgets. In our quarters ending March 31 (our third fiscal quarter), this trend generally reverses with better lead availability and often new budgets at the beginning of the year for our clients with fiscal years ending December 31.\nOur results are also subject to fluctuation as a result of seasonality in our clients' business. For example, revenue in our clients' lending businesses is subject to cyclical and seasonal trends. Home sales typically rise during the spring and summer months and decline during the fall and winter months, while refinancing and home equity activity is principally driven by mortgage interest rates as well as real estate values. Other factors affecting our clients' businesses include macro factors such as credit availability in the market, the strength of the economy and employment.\nRegulations\nOur revenue has fluctuated in part as a result of federal, state and industry-based regulations and developing standards with respect to the enforcement of those regulations. Our business is affected directly because we operate websites and conduct telemarketing and email marketing, and indirectly affected as our clients adjust their operations as a result of regulatory changes and enforcement activity that affect their industries.\nClients in our financial services vertical have been affected by laws and regulations and the increased enforcement of new and pre-existing laws and regulations. In addition, our education client vertical has been significantly affected by the adoption of regulations affecting U.S. for-profit education institutions over the past several years, and a high level of governmental scrutiny is expected to continue. The effect of these regulations, or any future regulations, may continue to result in fluctuations in the volume and mix of our business with these clients.\nAn example of a regulatory change that may affect our business is the amendment of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (the TCPA\u201d) that affects telemarketing calls. Our clients may make business decisions based on their own experiences with the TCPA regardless of our products and compliance practices. Those decisions may negatively affect our revenue or profitability.\nBasis of Presentation\nNet Revenue\nOur business generates revenue from fees earned through the delivery of qualified leads, inquiries, clicks, calls, applications, customers and, to a lesser extent, display advertisements, or impressions. We deliver targeted and measurable results through a vertical focus that we classify into the following client verticals: financial services, education and other\u201d (which includes home services and business-to-business technology).\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists primarily of media and marketing costs, personnel costs, amortization of intangible assets, depreciation expense and amortization of internal software development costs related to revenue-producing technologies. Media and marketing costs consist primarily of fees paid to third-party publishers, media owners or managers, or to strategic partners that are directly related to a revenue-generating event and of pay-per-click, or PPC, ad purchases from Internet search companies. We pay these third-party publishers, media owners or managers, strategic partners and Internet search companies on a revenue-share, a cost-per-lead, or CPL, cost-per-click, or CPC, or cost-per-thousand-impressions, or CPM, basis. Personnel costs include salaries, stock-based compensation expense, bonuses, commissions and employee benefit costs. Personnel costs are primarily related to individuals associated with maintaining our servers and websites, our call center operations, our editorial staff, client management, creative team, content, compliance group and media purchasing analysts. Costs associated with software incurred in the development phase or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized in cost of revenue over the software's estimated useful life.\nOperating Expenses\nWe classify our operating expenses into three categories: product development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative. Our operating expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and, to a lesser extent, professional services fees, facilities fees and other costs. Personnel costs for each category of operating expenses generally include salaries, stock-based compensation expense, bonuses, commissions and employee benefit costs.\nProduct Development. Product development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, facilities fees and professional services fees related to the development and maintenance of our products and media management platform. We are constraining expenses generally to the extent practicable.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, facilities fees and professional services fees. We are constraining expenses generally to the extent practicable.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs of our finance, legal, employee benefits and compliance, technical support and other administrative personnel, as well as accounting and legal professional services fees and facilities fees. We are constraining expenses generally to the extent practicable.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net\nInterest and other income (expense), net, consists primarily of interest income, interest expense, and other income and expense. Interest income represents interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents, which may increase or decrease depending on market interest rates and the amounts invested. Interest expense is related to our revolving loan facility which matured in June 2017, promissory notes issued in connection with our acquisitions, and imputed interest on non-interest bearing notes. We have no borrowing agreements outstanding as of June 30, 2018; however interest expense could increase if, among other things, we enter into a new borrowing agreement to manage liquidity or make additional acquisitions through debt financing. Other income and expense includes gains and losses on foreign currency exchange, gains and losses on sales of websites and domain names that were not considered to be strategically important to our business, impairment of investments and other non-operating items.\nBenefit from (Provision for) Income Taxes\nWe are subject to tax in the United States as well as other tax jurisdictions or countries in which we conduct business. Earnings from our limited non-U.S. activities are subject to local country income tax and may be subject to U.S. income tax.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated

Our financial services client vertical revenue increased $98.3 million, or 53%, primarily due to our enhanced product set that provides greater segmentation, matching, transparency, and right pricing of media which have enabled access to more media and client budgets and to additional strategic partnerships that have increased and diversified our access to quality media and client budgets. Our education client vertical revenue increased $5.1 million, or 7%, primarily due to increased client demand from not-for-profit education clients. Revenue from other client vertical increased by $1.1 million, or 3%, primarily due to increased client demand in our home services client vertical, partially offset by decreased client demand in our business-to-business technology vertical.\nNet revenue increased $2.1 million, or 1%, in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. Our financial services client vertical revenue increased $29.6 million, or 19%, primarily due to our enhanced product set that provides greater segmentation, transparency, and right pricing of media which have enabled access to more media and client budgets and to additional strategic partnerships that have increased and diversified our access to quality media and client budgets. Our education client vertical revenue decreased $18.0 million, or 20%, primarily due to exits from the channel of some for-profit education clients, decreased client demand as a result of client initiatives which include campus closures and discontinuation of certain education programs and lower budgets from certain education clients. Revenue from other client vertical decreased $9.5 million, or 18%, primarily due to decreased client demand in our business-to-business technology and medical client verticals, partially offset by increased client demand in our home services client vertical.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Profit Margin\nCost of revenue increased $76.5 million, or 28%, in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017. This was primarily driven by increased media and marketing costs of $81.1 million due to higher revenue volumes, as well as increased stock-based compensation expense of $0.9 million. This was primarily offset by decreased personnel costs of $2.3 million, mainly as a result of decreased average headcount in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 and a decrease of $3.4 million in depreciation and amortization expense. The decrease in personnel costs is primarily related to our corporate restructuring announced in November 2016. The decrease in amortization of intangible assets is attributable to assets from historical acquisitions becoming fully amortized. Depreciation expense declined due to decreased capital investing in recent periods. Gross profit margin, which is the difference between net revenue and cost of revenue as a percentage of net revenue, was 14% in fiscal year 2018 compared to 10% in fiscal year 2017. The increase in gross profit margin was attributable to decreased personnel costs and decreased amortization of intangible assets as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by a higher proportion of our revenue coming from our financial services client vertical, which tend to have higher media and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue.\nCost of revenue decreased $1.6 million, or 1%, in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, driven by decreased personnel costs of $5.6 million, decreased amortization of intangible assets of $2.7 million, decreased stock-based compensation expense of $0.7 million and decreased depreciation expense of $0.5 million, partially offset by increased media and marketing costs of $8.2 million. The decrease in personnel costs is primarily related to our corporate restructuring announced in November 2016 and decreased incentive compensation associated with the lower achievement of performance objectives. The decrease in amortization of intangible assets is attributable to assets from historical acquisitions becoming fully amortized and decreased spending in recent periods. The increase in media and marketing costs is primarily due to higher revenue volumes from our financial services client vertical, which tend to have higher media and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue. Gross profit margin, which is the difference between net revenue and cost of revenue as a percentage of net revenue, was 10% in fiscal year 2017 compared to 9% in fiscal year 2016. The increase in gross profit margin was attributable to decreased personnel costs and decreased amortization of intangible as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by a higher proportion of our revenue coming from our financial services client vertical, which tend to have higher media and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2018 - 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2017 - 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 42,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct Development Expenses\nProduct development expenses increased $0.3 million, or 2%, in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, primarily due to increased travel expense of $0.3 million mainly attributable to travel costs incurred in connection with our foreign operations.\nProduct development expenses decreased $3.0 million, or 18%, in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily due to decreased personnel costs of $1.9 million and decreased stock-based compensation expense of $0.5 million. The decrease in personnel costs was related to our corporate restructuring announced in November 2016 and decreased performance incentive compensation associated with the lower achievement of performance objectives.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses increased $1.2 million, or 13%, in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, primarily due to increased personnel costs associated with higher compensation costs and increased performance incentive compensation associated with the achievement of higher performance objectives.\nSales and marketing expenses decreased $2.8 million, or 24%, in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily due to decreased personnel costs of $1.7 million and decreased stock-based compensation expense of $0.7 million. The decrease in personnel costs was related to our corporate restructuring announced in November 2016 and decreased performance incentive compensation associated with the lower achievement of performance objectives.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $2.6 million, or 16%, in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, primarily due to increased personnel costs of $0.8 million, increased legal expense of $0.6 million, and increased professional fees of $0.6 million. The increase in personnel costs was related to increased performance incentive compensation associated with the higher achievement of performance objectives. The increase in legal expense was due to higher expenses related to compliance matters. The increase in professional services fees was due to the material weakness identified in fiscal year 2017.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $1.2 million, or 7%, in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily due to decreased personnel costs of $0.7 million and decreased litigation expense of $0.5 million. The decrease in personnel costs was related to our corporate restructuring announced in November 2016 and decreased performance incentive compensation associated with the lower achievement of performance objectives. The decrease in litigation expense was due to lower legal settlements.\nRestructuring Charges\nIn November 2016, we announced a corporate restructuring in order to accelerate margin expansion and grow cash flow. As a result, we recognized total cash and non-cash restructuring costs of $2.4 million related to employee severance and benefits in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, which represented substantially all costs expected to be incurred associated with the corporate restructuring. Benefits from the restructuring began to take effect in the three months ended December 31, 2016 and the restructuring was complete as of June 30, 2017.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2018 - 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2017 - 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (346\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (585\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (41\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,416\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2257\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,624\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (412\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest income was immaterial in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nInterest expense decreased $0.3 million, or 100% in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, and $0.2 million, or 41% in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily due to decreased debt obligations.\nOther income (expense), net increased $3.1 million in fiscal year 2018, or 128% compared to fiscal year 2017 primarily due to the impairment of our investment in a privately held entity of $2.5 million in fiscal year 2017 and income from the sale of other assets and domain names that were not considered strategically important to our business.

We recorded a benefit from income taxes of $1.1 million in fiscal year 2017, primarily as a result of a tax refund from an amended state tax return filing.\nWe recorded a provision for income taxes of $0.1 million in fiscal year 2016 primarily due to the outcome of a state tax examination, partially offset by the release of uncertain tax position reserves due to the expiration of the statute of limitations.\nOur effective tax rate was 3.5% in fiscal year 2018, 8.1% in fiscal year 2017 and (0.7%) in fiscal year 2016. Due to the effects of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance and our historical net operating loss, our annual effective tax rate was not meaningful as our income tax amounts were not directly correlated to the amount of income (loss) before income taxes for the periods.\nSelected Quarterly Financial Data\nThe following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly condensed consolidated statements of operations for the eight quarters ended June 30, 2018. We have prepared the statements of operations for each of these quarters on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report and, in the opinion of management, each statement of operations includes all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair statement of the results of operations for these periods. This information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. These quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of our operating results for any future period.\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three Months Ended\n</td>

percentage of net revenue, (ii) is used internally by management for planning purposes, including preparation of internal budgets; to allocate resources; to evaluate the effectiveness of operational strategies and capital expenditures as well as the capacity to service debt, (iii) it is a key basis upon which management assesses our operating performance, (iv) it is one of the primary metrics investors use in evaluating Internet marketing companies, (v) it is a factor in determining compensation, and (vi) it is an element of certain financial covenants under our historical borrowing arrangements. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) less benefit from (provision for) income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, interest and other income (expense), net, impairment of goodwill, restructuring expense, external expense related to the material weakness disclosed in our FY 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K and acquisition related expense.\nWe use adjusted EBITDA as a key performance measure because we believe it facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period by excluding potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense), tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or fluctuations in permanent differences or discrete quarterly items), non-recurring charges (such as restructuring expense, external expense related to the material weakness disclosed in our FY 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K, acquisition related expense and other income and expense) and the non-cash impact of depreciation expense, amortization expense and stock-based compensation expense.\nIn addition, we believe adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are widely used by investors, securities analysts, ratings agencies and other interested parties in our industry as a measure of financial performance, debt-service capabilities and as a metric for analyzing company valuations. Our use of adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures for capital equipment or other contractual commitments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of issuing stock-based compensation to our management team and employees;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> should we enter into borrowing arrangements in the future, adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements that may be necessary to service interest or principal payments on such indebtedness;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> adjusted EBITDA does not reflect certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDue to these limitations, adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. When evaluating our performance, adjusted EBITDA should be considered alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net (loss) income and our other GAAP results.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated:\nTable 141: <table> <tr>

We do so on a fiscal year basis by varying our operations to balance revenue growth and costs throughout the fiscal year. We do not seek to manage our business to a level of adjusted EBITDA on a quarterly basis and we expect our adjusted EBITDA margins to vary from quarter to quarter.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of June 30, 2018, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $64.7 million and cash we expect to generate from future operations. Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. We believe our cash equivalents are liquid and accessible.\nOur short-term and long-term liquidity requirements primarily arise from our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, internal software development costs and acquisitions from time to time. Our primary operating cash requirements include the payment of media costs, personnel costs, costs of information technology systems, office facilities and an unfunded lending commitment. Our ability to fund these requirements will depend on our future cash flows, which are determined, in part, by future operating performance and are, therefore, subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Even though we may not need additional funds to fund anticipated liquidity requirements, we may still elect to obtain debt financing or issue additional equity securities for other reasons.\nWe believe that our principal sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months.\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 26,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15,849\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,137\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,202\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18,505\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,497\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nCash from operating activities are primarily the result of our net income (loss) adjusted for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, impairment of investment and changes in working capital components.\nCash provided by operating activities was $27.0 million for fiscal year 2018 compared to $18.5 million for fiscal year 2017 and $1.0 million for fiscal year 2016.\nCash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2018 consisted of net income of $15.9 million, adjusted for non-cash adjustments of $17.4 million. In addition, there was a net decrease in cash from changes in working capital of $6.3 million. The non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expense of $10.2 million and depreciation and amortization of $7.8 million. The changes in working capital accounts were primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of $25.0 million primarily due to increased net revenues, offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $15.8 million, primarily due to an increase in media costs associated with increased revenue, and an increase in accrued performance incentive compensation associated with the higher achievement of performance objectives. The decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $1.9 million was primarily due to timing of payments and the decrease in other assets non-current of $1.1 million was primarily due to amortization expense for the year.\nCash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2017 consisted of a net loss of $12.2 million, which included a restructuring charge of $2.4 million, offset by non-cash adjustments of $23.0 million. In addition, there was a net increase in cash from changes in working capital of $7.8 million. The non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization of $11.4 million, stock-based compensation expense of $8.9 million and impairment of investment of $2.5 million. The changes in working capital accounts were primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $4.2 million, primarily due to the timing of cash payments, partially offset by a decrease in accrued performance incentive compensation of $2.0 million associated with the lower achievement of performance objectives. The decrease in accounts receivable of $2.9 million was primarily due to the timing of cash receipts.\nCash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2016 consisted of a net loss of $19.4 million, which included a restructuring charge of $0.3 million, offset by non-cash adjustments of $26.8 million. In addition, there was a net decrease in cash from changes in working capital of $6.3 million. The non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization of $15.1 million, stock-based compensation expense of $11.0 million, and provision for sales returns and doubtful accounts receivable of $0.8 million. The changes in working capital accounts were primarily due to an increase in other assets, noncurrent of $8.2 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $1.8 million, partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $4.5 million. The increase in other assets, noncurrent, was primarily due to a one-time $10.0 million cash payment to All Web Leads, a strategic partner, to be their exclusive click monetization partner for the majority of their insurance categories and the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the timing of cash receipts. The decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets was primarily due to a cash receipt from a federal tax refund of $6.5 million.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nCash from investing activities generally include capital expenditures, capitalized internal development costs, and acquisitions from time to time.\nCash used in investing activities was $15.8 million for fiscal year 2018, compared to $4.1 million in fiscal year 2017 and $5.2 million in fiscal year 2016.\nCash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to our acquisition of certain assets of Katch, LLC for $14.0 million and capital expenditures and internal software development costs of $2.8 million offset by proceeds from sales of other assets and domain names of $1.1 million.\nCash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to capital expenditures and internal software development costs of $3.3 million and an increase in restricted cash of $0.8 million held as collateral for letters of credit related to our corporate headquarters' operating lease and fidelity bonds placed with an insurance company.\nCash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to capital expenditures and internal software development costs of $5.3 million.\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities\nCash from financing activities generally include repayments on loan facilities and acquisition-related notes payable, repurchases of common stock, payment of withholding taxes related to the release of restricted stock, net of share settlement and proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nCash provided by financing activities was $3.9 million for fiscal year 2018 compared to cash used of $18.5 million for fiscal year 2017 and $2.5 million for fiscal year 2016.\nCash provided by financing activities in fiscal year 2018 was due to proceeds from the exercise of common stock options of $11.0 million, offset by payment of withholding taxes related to the release of restricted stock, net of share settlement of $6.5 million and repurchases of common stock of $0.6 million.\nCash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2017 was due to repayment of the revolving loan facility of $15.0 million, repurchases of common stock of $2.5 million and payment of withholding taxes related to the release of restricted stock, net of share settlement of $1.0 million.\nCash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to payment of withholding taxes related to the release of restricted stock, net of share settlement of $2.5 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuring the periods presented, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We have an investment in a variable interest entity of which we are not the primary beneficiary and as to which we do not have any material obligations.\nAdditionally, in the third quarter of 2018, we entered into an unsecured revolving promissory note as a lender, as part of a strategic partnership intended to increase our presence in the emerging technology career education market. The principal balance at any time cannot exceed $2.5 million and any outstanding principal balance bears interest at an annual rate of 6.00% payable monthly. Repayment of the principal balance can occur without premium or penalty in whole or in part at any time. In the event of an equity offering by the borrower, any outstanding principal balance may be converted into equity securities of the borrower at the mutual agreement of us and the borrower. Any outstanding principal balance and any accrued and unpaid interest is due on January 1, 2019. As of June 30, 2018, there were no amounts outstanding.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth payments due under our contractual obligations as of June 30, 2018:\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lending Commitment(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> The lending commitment represents the unfunded balance on the unsecured revolving promissory note described under Off Balance Sheet Arrangements\u201d as of June 30, 2018.

The term of the lease began on November 1, 2010 and expires on October 31, 2018. The monthly base rent was abated for the first 12 calendar months under the lease, and remained at $0.1 million through the 24th calendar month of the term of the lease. After this 24 month period, monthly base rent increased to $0.2 million for the subsequent 12 months and now increases approximately 3% after each 12-month anniversary during the remaining term.\nIn April 2018, we amended the lease agreement. The extended lease term period begins on November 1, 2018 and expires on October 31, 2023. Additionally, the square footage of office space was reduced to approximately 44,556. During the first year of the extended lease term, the monthly base rent will be abated for the first eight months, and increases to $0.2 million for the remaining four months. During the second year of the extended lease term, the monthly base rent will be abated for the first four months, increase to $0.2 million for the fifth month, and increase to $0.3 million for the remaining seven months. Subsequently, after each 12-month anniversary, the monthly base rent will increase by approximately 3%. We have one option to extend the term of the lease for an additional five years following October 31, 2023.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe have prepared our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). In doing so, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.\nSome of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events. We base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience or on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we reconsider and evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates.\nWe believe that the critical accounting policies listed below involve our more significant judgments, estimates and assumptions and, therefore, could have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. In addition, we believe that a discussion of these policies is necessary to understand and evaluate the consolidated financial statements contained in this report.\nSee Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Principles, of our consolidated financial statements for further information on our critical and other significant accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue earned through the delivery of qualified leads, inquiries, clicks, calls, applications, customers and, to a lesser extent, display advertisements, or impressions constituted all revenue in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Delivery is deemed to have occurred at the time a qualified lead, inquiry, click, call, application, or customer is delivered to the client provided that no significant obligations remain.\nUnder our revenue recognition policies, we allocate revenue in an arrangement using the estimated selling price ( ESP\u201d) of deliverables if vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d) of selling price based on historical stand-alone sales or third-party evidence ( TPE\u201d) of selling price does not exist. Due to the unique nature of some of our multiple deliverable revenue arrangements, we may not be able to establish selling prices based on historical stand-alone sales or third-party evidence, therefore we may use our best estimate to establish selling prices for these arrangements under the standard. We establish best estimates within a range of selling prices considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, factors such as class of client, size of transaction, available media inventory, pricing strategies and market conditions. We believe the use of the best estimate of selling price allows revenue recognition in a manner consistent with the underlying economics of the transaction.\nFrom time to time, we may agree to credit a client for certain leads, inquiries, clicks, calls, applications, or customers if they fail to meet the contractual or other guidelines of a particular client. We have established a sales reserve based on historical experience. To date, such credits have been within our expectations.\nSeparately from the agreements we have with clients, we have agreements with Internet search companies, third-party publishers and strategic partners to generate potential qualified leads, inquiries, clicks, calls, applications, or customers. We receive a fee from our clients and separately pay a fee to the Internet search companies, third-party publishers and strategic partners. We are the primary obligor in the transaction. As a result, the fees paid by our clients are recognized as revenue and the fees paid to our Internet search companies, third-party publishers and strategic partners are included in cost of revenue.\nDeferred revenue is comprised of contractual billings in excess of recognized revenue and payments received in advance of revenue recognition.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure and record the expense related to stock-based transactions based on the fair value of the stock-based payment awards as determined on the date of grant. The fair value of restricted stock units with a service condition is determined based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. For stock options, we have selected and used the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value. For restricted stock units with a service and market condition, we have selected and used the Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the fair value. In applying these models, our determination of fair value is affected by assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the award and the employees' actual and projected stock option exercise and pre-vesting employment termination behaviors. We estimate the expected volatility of our common stock based on our historical volatility over the expected term of the award. We have no history or expectation of paying dividends on our common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield for a term consistent with the expected term of the award.\nWe recognize stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period using the straight-line method, based on awards ultimately expected to vest. We estimate future forfeitures at the date of grant. On an annual basis, we assess changes in our estimate of expected forfeitures based on recent forfeiture activity. The effect of adjustments made to forfeiture rates, if any, is recognized in the period that the change is made.\nGoodwill\nWe conduct a test for the impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level on at least an annual basis and whenever there are events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the estimated fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. Significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows and determining appropriate discount rates, growth rates, an appropriate control premium and other assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit which could trigger impairment.\nWe perform our annual goodwill impairment test on April 30 and conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. In assessing the qualitative factors, we consider the impact of key factors such as changes in industry and competitive environment, stock price, actual revenue performance compared to previous years, forecasts and cash flow generation. We had one reporting unit for purposes of allocating and testing goodwill for fiscal years 2018 and 2017. Based on the results of the qualitative assessment completed as of April 30, 2018 and 2017, there were no indicators of impairment.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, our public market capitalization experienced a decline to a value below the net book carrying value of our equity which triggered the necessity to conduct an interim goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2016. As all revenue in fiscal year 2016 had been earned through the delivery of qualified leads, inquiries, clicks, calls, applications, customers, and to a lesser extent, display advertisements, or impressions, we had one reporting unit as of March 31, 2016. Given that our shares are publicly traded in an active market, we believe that the quoted market price provides evidence of fair value. As of March 31, 2016, our market capitalization exceeded our net book carrying value. Additionally, we estimated fair value utilizing a weighting of the fair values derived from the market and income approach which exceeded our net book carrying value. Based on the results of the step one interim impairment test, we determined there was no goodwill impairment as of March 31, 2016.\nWe performed our annual goodwill impairment test on April 30, 2016 for fiscal year 2016. We conducted a qualitative assessment to determine whether it was necessary to perform a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. In assessing the qualitative factors, we considered any significant changes in key factors such as changes in industry and competitive environment, stock price, actual revenue performance compared to previous years and budget, EBITDA and cash flow generation, since the most recent valuation date, March 31, 2016. Based on the results of the qualitative assessment, there were no indicators of impairment. As of June 30, 2016, we did not identify any indicators of impairment.\nLong-Lived Assets\nWe evaluate long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and purchased intangible assets with finite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If necessary, a quantitative test is performed that requires the application of judgment when assessing the fair value of an asset. When we identify an impairment, we reduce the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow approach or, when available and appropriate, to comparable market values. As of April 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we evaluated our long-lived assets and concluded there were no indicators of impairment.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach to record deferred taxes. Our deferred income tax assets represent temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amount and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities that will result in deductible amounts in future years, including net operating loss carry forwards. A valuation allowance is recorded against our deferred tax assets which are not expected to be realized. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. We recorded a valuation allowance against the majority of our deferred tax assets at the end of fiscal year 2014 due to the significant negative evidence that the near term realization of certain assets were deemed unlikely. We continue to maintain the valuation allowance as of June 30, 2018.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements

Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in the sections titled Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors.\u201d\nManagement Overview\nWe are a leader in performance marketing products and technologies. We specialize in customer acquisition for clients in high value, information-intensive markets or verticals,\u201d including financial services, education, home services and business-to-business technology. Our clients include some of the world's largest companies and brands in those markets. While the majority of our operations and revenue are in North America, we also have emerging businesses in Brazil and India.\nWe deliver measurable and cost-effective marketing results to our clients, typically in the form of a qualified lead, inquiry, click, call, application, or customer. Leads, inquiries, clicks, calls, and applications can then convert into a customer or sale for clients at a rate that results in an acceptable marketing cost to them. We are typically paid by clients when we deliver qualified leads, inquiries, clicks, calls, applications, or customers as defined by our agreements with them. References to the delivery of customers means a sale or completed customer transaction (e.g., bound insurance policies or customer appointments with clients). Because we bear the costs of media, our programs must result in attractive marketing costs to our clients at media costs and margins that provide sound financial outcomes for us. To deliver leads, inquiries, clicks, calls, applications, and customers to our clients, generally we:\n \u2022 own or access targeted media through business arrangements (e.g., revenue sharing arrangements) or by purchasing media (e.g., clicks from major search engines); \n \u2022 run advertisements or other forms of marketing messages and programs in that media to create visitor responses typically in the form of leads or inquiries (e.g., contact information), clicks (to further qualification or matching steps, or to online client applications or offerings), calls (to our owned and operated call centers or that of our clients or their agents), applications (e.g., for enrollment or a financial product), or customers (e.g., bound insurance policies); \n \u2022 match these leads, inquiries, clicks, calls, applications, or customers to client offerings or brands that we believe can meet visitor interests or needs and client targets and requirements; and \n \u2022 optimize client matches and media costs such that we achieve desired results for clients and a sound financial outcome for us. \nOur primary financial objective has been and remains creating revenue growth from sustainable sources, at target levels of profitability. Our primary financial objective is not to maximize profits, but rather to achieve target levels of profitability while investing in various growth initiatives, as we continue to believe we are in the early stages of a large, long-term market opportunity.\nOur business derives its net revenue from fees earned through the delivery of qualified leads, inquiries, clicks, calls, applications, or customers and, to a lesser extent, display advertisements, or impressions. Through a vertical focus, targeted media presence and our technology platform, we are able to deliver targeted, measurable marketing results to our clients.\nOur two largest client verticals are financial services and education. Our financial services client vertical represented 70%, 62% and 52% of net revenue in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016. Our education client vertical represented 19%, 24% and 30% of net revenue in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016. Our other client vertical, consisting of home services and business-to-business technology, represented 11%, 14% and 18% of net revenue in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016. We generated the majority of our revenue from sales to clients in the United States.\nTrends Affecting our Business\nClient Verticals\nTo date, we have generated the majority of our revenue from clients in our financial services and education client verticals. We expect that a majority of our revenue in fiscal year 2019 will continue to be generated from clients in these two client verticals.\nOur financial services client vertical has been challenged by a number of factors in the past, including the limited availability of high quality media at acceptable margins caused by acquisition of media sources by competitors, increased competition for high quality media and changes in search engine algorithms. These effects may impact our business in the future again. To offset this impact, we have enhanced our product set to provide greater segmentation, matching, transparency and right pricing of media that have enabled better monetization to provide greater access to high quality media sources. Moreover, we have entered into strategic partnerships and acquisitions to increase and diversify our access to quality media and client budgets. Our financial services client vertical also benefits from more spending by clients in digital media and performance marketing as digital marketing continues to evolve.\nOur education client vertical has been significantly challenged by regulations and enforcement activity affecting U.S. for-profit education institutions over the past several years. For example, in July 2015, the Federal Trade Commission initiated an investigation of a publicly traded U.S. for-profit education client with respect to its recruiting and enrollment practices. These and other similar regulatory and enforcement activities have affected and are expected to continue to affect our clients' businesses and marketing practices, which have and may continue to, result in a decrease in these clients' spending with us and other vendors and fluctuations in the volume and mix of our business with these clients. To offset the impact these regulatory and investigative activities have had on the U.S. for-profit education clients, we have broadened our product set from our traditional lead business with the addition of better qualified and matched leads or inquiries, clicks and calls; we believe these new enhanced products better match U.S. for-profit education client needs in the current regulatory environment. We have also broadened our markets in education to include not-for-profit schools and international markets in Brazil and India. Moreover, we have entered into strategic partnerships to increase and diversify our access to quality media and client budgets.\nDevelopment, Acquisition and Retention of High Quality Targeted Media\nOne of the primary challenges of our business is finding or creating media that is high quality and targeted enough to attract prospects for our clients at costs that provide a sound financial outcome for us. In order to grow our business, we must be able to find, develop and retain quality targeted media on a cost-effective basis. Consolidation of media sources, changes in search engine algorithms and increased competition for available media has, during some periods, limited and may continue to limit our ability to generate revenue at acceptable margins. To offset this impact, we have developed new sources of media, including entering into strategic partnerships with other marketing and media companies and acquisitions. Such partnerships include takeovers of performance marketing functions for large web media properties; backend monetization of unmatched traffic for clients with large media buys; and white label products for other performance marketing companies. We have also focused on growing our revenue from email, mobile and social media traffic sources.\nSeasonality\nOur results are subject to significant fluctuation as a result of seasonality. In particular, our quarters ending December 31 (our second fiscal quarter) are typically characterized by seasonal weakness. In our second fiscal quarters, there is lower availability of lead supply from some forms of media during the holiday period on a cost effective basis and some of our clients have lower budgets. In our quarters ending March 31 (our third fiscal quarter), this trend generally reverses with better lead availability and often new budgets at the beginning of the year for our clients with fiscal years ending December 31.\nOur results are also subject to fluctuation as a result of seasonality in our clients' business. For example, revenue in our clients' lending businesses is subject to cyclical and seasonal trends. Home sales typically rise during the spring and summer months and decline during the fall and winter months, while refinancing and home equity activity is principally driven by mortgage interest rates as well as real estate values. Other factors affecting our clients' businesses include macro factors such as credit availability in the market, the strength of the economy and employment.\nRegulations\nOur revenue has fluctuated in part as a result of federal, state and industry-based regulations and developing standards with respect to the enforcement of those regulations. Our business is affected directly because we operate websites and conduct telemarketing and email marketing, and indirectly affected as our clients adjust their operations as a result of regulatory changes and enforcement activity that affect their industries.\nClients in our financial services vertical have been affected by laws and regulations and the increased enforcement of new and pre-existing laws and regulations. In addition, our education client vertical has been significantly affected by the adoption of regulations affecting U.S. for-profit education institutions over the past several years, and a high level of governmental scrutiny is expected to continue. The effect of these regulations, or any future regulations, may continue to result in fluctuations in the volume and mix of our business with these clients.\nAn example of a regulatory change that may affect our business is the amendment of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (the TCPA\u201d) that affects telemarketing calls. Our clients may make business decisions based on their own experiences with the TCPA regardless of our products and compliance practices. Those decisions may negatively affect our revenue or profitability.\nBasis of Presentation\nNet Revenue\nOur business generates revenue from fees earned through the delivery of qualified leads, inquiries, clicks, calls, applications, customers and, to a lesser extent, display advertisements, or impressions. We deliver targeted and measurable results through a vertical focus that we classify into the following client verticals: financial services, education and other\u201d (which includes home services and business-to-business technology).\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists primarily of media and marketing costs, personnel costs, amortization of intangible assets, depreciation expense and amortization of internal software development costs related to revenue-producing technologies. Media and marketing costs consist primarily of fees paid to third-party publishers, media owners or managers, or to strategic partners that are directly related to a revenue-generating event and of pay-per-click, or PPC, ad purchases from Internet search companies. We pay these third-party publishers, media owners or managers, strategic partners and Internet search companies on a revenue-share, a cost-per-lead, or CPL, cost-per-click, or CPC, or cost-per-thousand-impressions, or CPM, basis. Personnel costs include salaries, stock-based compensation expense, bonuses, commissions and employee benefit costs. Personnel costs are primarily related to individuals associated with maintaining our servers and websites, our call center operations, our editorial staff, client management, creative team, content, compliance group and media purchasing analysts. Costs associated with software incurred in the development phase or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized in cost of revenue over the software's estimated useful life.\nOperating Expenses\nWe classify our operating expenses into three categories: product development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative. Our operating expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and, to a lesser extent, professional services fees, facilities fees and other costs. Personnel costs for each category of operating expenses generally include salaries, stock-based compensation expense, bonuses, commissions and employee benefit costs.\nProduct Development. Product development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, facilities fees and professional services fees related to the development and maintenance of our products and media management platform. We are constraining expenses generally to the extent practicable.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, facilities fees and professional services fees. We are constraining expenses generally to the extent practicable.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs of our finance, legal, employee benefits and compliance, technical support and other administrative personnel, as well as accounting and legal professional services fees and facilities fees. We are constraining expenses generally to the extent practicable.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net\nInterest and other income (expense), net, consists primarily of interest income, interest expense, and other income and expense. Interest income represents interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents, which may increase or decrease depending on market interest rates and the amounts invested. Interest expense is related to our revolving loan facility which matured in June 2017, promissory notes issued in connection with our acquisitions, and imputed interest on non-interest bearing notes. We have no borrowing agreements outstanding as of June 30, 2018; however interest expense could increase if, among other things, we enter into a new borrowing agreement to manage liquidity or make additional acquisitions through debt financing. Other income and expense includes gains and losses on foreign currency exchange, gains and losses on sales of websites and domain names that were not considered to be strategically important to our business, impairment of investments and other non-operating items.\nBenefit from (Provision for) Income Taxes\nWe are subject to tax in the United States as well as other tax jurisdictions or countries in which we conduct business. Earnings from our limited non-U.S. activities are subject to local country income tax and may be subject to U.S. income tax.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated:\n\n (1) Cost of revenue and operating expenses include stock-based compensation expense as follows: \n\nGross Profit\n\nNet Revenue\nNet revenue increased $104.6 million, or 35%, in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017. Our financial services client vertical revenue increased $98.3 million, or 53%, primarily due to our enhanced product set that provides greater segmentation, matching, transparency, and right pricing of media which have enabled access to more media and client budgets and to additional strategic partnerships that have increased and diversified our access to quality media and client budgets. Our education client vertical revenue increased $5.1 million, or 7%, primarily due to increased client demand from not-for-profit education clients. Revenue from other client vertical increased by $1.1 million, or 3%, primarily due to increased client demand in our home services client vertical, partially offset by decreased client demand in our business-to-business technology vertical.\nNet revenue increased $2.1 million, or 1%, in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. Our financial services client vertical revenue increased $29.6 million, or 19%, primarily due to our enhanced product set that provides greater segmentation, transparency, and right pricing of media which have enabled access to more media and client budgets and to additional strategic partnerships that have increased and diversified our access to quality media and client budgets. Our education client vertical revenue decreased $18.0 million, or 20%, primarily due to exits from the channel of some for-profit education clients, decreased client demand as a result of client initiatives which include campus closures and discontinuation of certain education programs and lower budgets from certain education clients. Revenue from other client vertical decreased $9.5 million, or 18%, primarily due to decreased client demand in our business-to-business technology and medical client verticals, partially offset by increased client demand in our home services client vertical.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Profit Margin\nCost of revenue increased $76.5 million, or 28%, in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017. This was primarily driven by increased media and marketing costs of $81.1 million due to higher revenue volumes, as well as increased stock-based compensation expense of $0.9 million. This was primarily offset by decreased personnel costs of $2.3 million, mainly as a result of decreased average headcount in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 and a decrease of $3.4 million in depreciation and amortization expense. The decrease in personnel costs is primarily related to our corporate restructuring announced in November 2016. The decrease in amortization of intangible assets is attributable to assets from historical acquisitions becoming fully amortized. Depreciation expense declined due to decreased capital investing in recent periods. Gross profit margin, which is the difference between net revenue and cost of revenue as a percentage of net revenue, was 14% in fiscal year 2018 compared to 10% in fiscal year 2017. The increase in gross profit margin was attributable to decreased personnel costs and decreased amortization of intangible assets as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by a higher proportion of our revenue coming from our financial services client vertical, which tend to have higher media and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue.\nCost of revenue decreased $1.6 million, or 1%, in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, driven by decreased personnel costs of $5.6 million, decreased amortization of intangible assets of $2.7 million, decreased stock-based compensation expense of $0.7 million and decreased depreciation expense of $0.5 million, partially offset by increased media and marketing costs of $8.2 million. The decrease in personnel costs is primarily related to our corporate restructuring announced in November 2016 and decreased incentive compensation associated with the lower achievement of performance objectives. The decrease in amortization of intangible assets is attributable to assets from historical acquisitions becoming fully amortized and decreased spending in recent periods. The increase in media and marketing costs is primarily due to higher revenue volumes from our financial services client vertical, which tend to have higher media and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue. Gross profit margin, which is the difference between net revenue and cost of revenue as a percentage of net revenue, was 10% in fiscal year 2017 compared to 9% in fiscal year 2016. The increase in gross profit margin was attributable to decreased personnel costs and decreased amortization of intangible as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by a higher proportion of our revenue coming from our financial services client vertical, which tend to have higher media and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue.\nOperating Expenses\n\nProduct Development Expenses\nProduct development expenses increased $0.3 million, or 2%, in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, primarily due to increased travel expense of $0.3 million mainly attributable to travel costs incurred in connection with our foreign operations.\nProduct development expenses decreased $3.0 million, or 18%, in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily due to decreased personnel costs of $1.9 million and decreased stock-based compensation expense of $0.5 million. The decrease in personnel costs was related to our corporate restructuring announced in November 2016 and decreased performance incentive compensation associated with the lower achievement of performance objectives.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses increased $1.2 million, or 13%, in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, primarily due to increased personnel costs associated with higher compensation costs and increased performance incentive compensation associated with the achievement of higher performance objectives.\nSales and marketing expenses decreased $2.8 million, or 24%, in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily due to decreased personnel costs of $1.7 million and decreased stock-based compensation expense of $0.7 million. The decrease in personnel costs was related to our corporate restructuring announced in November 2016 and decreased performance incentive compensation associated with the lower achievement of performance objectives.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $2.6 million, or 16%, in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, primarily due to increased personnel costs of $0.8 million, increased legal expense of $0.6 million, and increased professional fees of $0.6 million. The increase in personnel costs was related to increased performance incentive compensation associated with the higher achievement of performance objectives. The increase in legal expense was due to higher expenses related to compliance matters. The increase in professional services fees was due to the material weakness identified in fiscal year 2017.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $1.2 million, or 7%, in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily due to decreased personnel costs of $0.7 million and decreased litigation expense of $0.5 million. The decrease in personnel costs was related to our corporate restructuring announced in November 2016 and decreased performance incentive compensation associated with the lower achievement of performance objectives. The decrease in litigation expense was due to lower legal settlements.\nRestructuring Charges\nIn November 2016, we announced a corporate restructuring in order to accelerate margin expansion and grow cash flow. As a result, we recognized total cash and non-cash restructuring costs of $2.4 million related to employee severance and benefits in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, which represented substantially all costs expected to be incurred associated with the corporate restructuring. Benefits from the restructuring began to take effect in the three months ended December 31, 2016 and the restructuring was complete as of June 30, 2017.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nInterest income was immaterial in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nInterest expense decreased $0.3 million, or 100% in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, and $0.2 million, or 41% in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily due to decreased debt obligations.\nOther income (expense), net increased $3.1 million in fiscal year 2018, or 128% compared to fiscal year 2017 primarily due to the impairment of our investment in a privately held entity of $2.5 million in fiscal year 2017 and income from the sale of other assets and domain names that were not considered strategically important to our business. Other income (expense), net decreased $2.5 million in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily due to the impairment of our investment in a privately held entity of $2.5 million.\nBenefit from (Provision for) Income Taxes\n\nWe recorded an expense from income taxes of $0.6 million in fiscal year 2018, primarily as a result of current state and foreign income taxes. We recorded a benefit from income taxes of $1.1 million in fiscal year 2017, primarily as a result of a tax refund from an amended state tax return filing.\nWe recorded a provision for income taxes of $0.1 million in fiscal year 2016 primarily due to the outcome of a state tax examination, partially offset by the release of uncertain tax position reserves due to the expiration of the statute of limitations.\nOur effective tax rate was 3.5% in fiscal year 2018, 8.1% in fiscal year 2017 and (0.7%) in fiscal year 2016. Due to the effects of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance and our historical net operating loss, our annual effective tax rate was not meaningful as our income tax amounts were not directly correlated to the amount of income (loss) before income taxes for the periods.\nSelected Quarterly Financial Data\nThe following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly condensed consolidated statements of operations for the eight quarters ended June 30, 2018. We have prepared the statements of operations for each of these quarters on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report and, in the opinion of management, each statement of operations includes all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair statement of the results of operations for these periods. This information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. These quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of our operating results for any future period.\n\n (1) Net income (loss) per share for the four quarters of each fiscal year may not sum to the total for the fiscal year as a result of the different number of shares outstanding during each period. \nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe include adjusted EBITDA in this report because (i) we seek to manage our business to a level of adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue, (ii) is used internally by management for planning purposes, including preparation of internal budgets; to allocate resources; to evaluate the effectiveness of operational strategies and capital expenditures as well as the capacity to service debt, (iii) it is a key basis upon which management assesses our operating performance, (iv) it is one of the primary metrics investors use in evaluating Internet marketing companies, (v) it is a factor in determining compensation, and (vi) it is an element of certain financial covenants under our historical borrowing arrangements. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) less benefit from (provision for) income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, interest and other income (expense), net, impairment of goodwill, restructuring expense, external expense related to the material weakness disclosed in our FY 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K and acquisition related expense.\nWe use adjusted EBITDA as a key performance measure because we believe it facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period by excluding potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense), tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or fluctuations in permanent differences or discrete quarterly items), non-recurring charges (such as restructuring expense, external expense related to the material weakness disclosed in our FY 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K, acquisition related expense and other income and expense) and the non-cash impact of depreciation expense, amortization expense and stock-based compensation expense.\nIn addition, we believe adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are widely used by investors, securities analysts, ratings agencies and other interested parties in our industry as a measure of financial performance, debt-service capabilities and as a metric for analyzing company valuations. Our use of adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures for capital equipment or other contractual commitments; \n \u2022 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements; \n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of issuing stock-based compensation to our management team and employees; \n \u2022 should we enter into borrowing arrangements in the future, adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements that may be necessary to service interest or principal payments on such indebtedness; \n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and \n \u2022 other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. \nDue to these limitations, adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. When evaluating our performance, adjusted EBITDA should be considered alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net (loss) income and our other GAAP results.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated:\n\nWe seek to manage our business to a level of adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue. We do so on a fiscal year basis by varying our operations to balance revenue growth and costs throughout the fiscal year. We do not seek to manage our business to a level of adjusted EBITDA on a quarterly basis and we expect our adjusted EBITDA margins to vary from quarter to quarter.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of June 30, 2018, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $64.7 million and cash we expect to generate from future operations. Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. We believe our cash equivalents are liquid and accessible.\nOur short-term and long-term liquidity requirements primarily arise from our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, internal software development costs and acquisitions from time to time. Our primary operating cash requirements include the payment of media costs, personnel costs, costs of information technology systems, office facilities and an unfunded lending commitment. Our ability to fund these requirements will depend on our future cash flows, which are determined, in part, by future operating performance and are, therefore, subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Even though we may not need additional funds to fund anticipated liquidity requirements, we may still elect to obtain debt financing or issue additional equity securities for other reasons.\nWe believe that our principal sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months.\n\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nCash from operating activities are primarily the result of our net income (loss) adjusted for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, impairment of investment and changes in working capital components.\nCash provided by operating activities was $27.0 million for fiscal year 2018 compared to $18.5 million for fiscal year 2017 and $1.0 million for fiscal year 2016.\nCash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2018 consisted of net income of $15.9 million, adjusted for non-cash adjustments of $17.4 million. In addition, there was a net decrease in cash from changes in working capital of $6.3 million. The non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expense of $10.2 million and depreciation and amortization of $7.8 million. The changes in working capital accounts were primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of $25.0 million primarily due to increased net revenues, offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $15.8 million, primarily due to an increase in media costs associated with increased revenue, and an increase in accrued performance incentive compensation associated with the higher achievement of performance objectives. The decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $1.9 million was primarily due to timing of payments and the decrease in other assets non-current of $1.1 million was primarily due to amortization expense for the year.\nCash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2017 consisted of a net loss of $12.2 million, which included a restructuring charge of $2.4 million, offset by non-cash adjustments of $23.0 million. In addition, there was a net increase in cash from changes in working capital of $7.8 million. The non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization of $11.4 million, stock-based compensation expense of $8.9 million and impairment of investment of $2.5 million. The changes in working capital accounts were primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $4.2 million, primarily due to the timing of cash payments, partially offset by a decrease in accrued performance incentive compensation of $2.0 million associated with the lower achievement of performance objectives. The decrease in accounts receivable of $2.9 million was primarily due to the timing of cash receipts.\nCash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2016 consisted of a net loss of $19.4 million, which included a restructuring charge of $0.3 million, offset by non-cash adjustments of $26.8 million. In addition, there was a net decrease in cash from changes in working capital of $6.3 million. The non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization of $15.1 million, stock-based compensation expense of $11.0 million, and provision for sales returns and doubtful accounts receivable of $0.8 million. The changes in working capital accounts were primarily due to an increase in other assets, noncurrent of $8.2 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $1.8 million, partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $4.5 million. The increase in other assets, noncurrent, was primarily due to a one-time $10.0 million cash payment to All Web Leads, a strategic partner, to be their exclusive click monetization partner for the majority of their insurance categories and the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the timing of cash receipts. The decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets was primarily due to a cash receipt from a federal tax refund of $6.5 million.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nCash from investing activities generally include capital expenditures, capitalized internal development costs, and acquisitions from time to time.\nCash used in investing activities was $15.8 million for fiscal year 2018, compared to $4.1 million in fiscal year 2017 and $5.2 million in fiscal year 2016.\nCash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to our acquisition of certain assets of Katch, LLC for $14.0 million and capital expenditures and internal software development costs of $2.8 million offset by proceeds from sales of other assets and domain names of $1.1 million.\nCash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to capital expenditures and internal software development costs of $3.3 million and an increase in restricted cash of $0.8 million held as collateral for letters of credit related to our corporate headquarters' operating lease and fidelity bonds placed with an insurance company.\nCash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to capital expenditures and internal software development costs of $5.3 million.\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities\nCash from financing activities generally include repayments on loan facilities and acquisition-related notes payable, repurchases of common stock, payment of withholding taxes related to the release of restricted stock, net of share settlement and proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nCash provided by financing activities was $3.9 million for fiscal year 2018 compared to cash used of $18.5 million for fiscal year 2017 and $2.5 million for fiscal year 2016.\nCash provided by financing activities in fiscal year 2018 was due to proceeds from the exercise of common stock options of $11.0 million, offset by payment of withholding taxes related to the release of restricted stock, net of share settlement of $6.5 million and repurchases of common stock of $0.6 million.\nCash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2017 was due to repayment of the revolving loan facility of $15.0 million, repurchases of common stock of $2.5 million and payment of withholding taxes related to the release of restricted stock, net of share settlement of $1.0 million.\nCash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to payment of withholding taxes related to the release of restricted stock, net of share settlement of $2.5 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuring the periods presented, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We have an investment in a variable interest entity of which we are not the primary beneficiary and as to which we do not have any material obligations.\nAdditionally, in the third quarter of 2018, we entered into an unsecured revolving promissory note as a lender, as part of a strategic partnership intended to increase our presence in the emerging technology career education market. The principal balance at any time cannot exceed $2.5 million and any outstanding principal balance bears interest at an annual rate of 6.00% payable monthly. Repayment of the principal balance can occur without premium or penalty in whole or in part at any time. In the event of an equity offering by the borrower, any outstanding principal balance may be converted into equity securities of the borrower at the mutual agreement of us and the borrower. Any outstanding principal balance and any accrued and unpaid interest is due on January 1, 2019. As of June 30, 2018, there were no amounts outstanding.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth payments due under our contractual obligations as of June 30, 2018:\n\n (1) The lending commitment represents the unfunded balance on the unsecured revolving promissory note described under Off Balance Sheet Arrangements\u201d as of June 30, 2018. The principal balance anytime cannot exceed $2.5 million and repayment of the principal balance can occur without premium or penalty in whole or in part at any time. Refer to Note 9 for more information on the lending commitment. \nThe above table does not include approximately $2.2 million of long-term income tax liabilities for uncertainty in income taxes due to the fact that we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of these potential future payments.\nHeadquarters Lease\nWe entered into a lease agreement in February 2010 for approximately 63,998 square feet of office space located at 950 Tower Lane, Foster City, California. The term of the lease began on November 1, 2010 and expires on October 31, 2018. The monthly base rent was abated for the first 12 calendar months under the lease, and remained at $0.1 million through the 24th calendar month of the term of the lease. After this 24 month period, monthly base rent increased to $0.2 million for the subsequent 12 months and now increases approximately 3% after each 12-month anniversary during the remaining term.\nIn April 2018, we amended the lease agreement. The extended lease term period begins on November 1, 2018 and expires on October 31, 2023. Additionally, the square footage of office space was reduced to approximately 44,556. During the first year of the extended lease term, the monthly base rent will be abated for the first eight months, and increases to $0.2 million for the remaining four months. During the second year of the extended lease term, the monthly base rent will be abated for the first four months, increase to $0.2 million for the fifth month, and increase to $0.3 million for the remaining seven months. Subsequently, after each 12-month anniversary, the monthly base rent will increase by approximately 3%. We have one option to extend the term of the lease for an additional five years following October 31, 2023.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe have prepared our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). In doing so, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.\nSome of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events. We base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience or on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we reconsider and evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates.\nWe believe that the critical accounting policies listed below involve our more significant judgments, estimates and assumptions and, therefore, could have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. In addition, we believe that a discussion of these policies is necessary to understand and evaluate the consolidated financial statements contained in this report.\nSee Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Principles, of our consolidated financial statements for further information on our critical and other significant accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue earned through the delivery of qualified leads, inquiries, clicks, calls, applications, customers and, to a lesser extent, display advertisements, or impressions constituted all revenue in fiscal years 2018,", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in the sections titled Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors.\u201d\nManagement Overview\nWe are a leader in performance marketing products and technologies. We specialize in customer acquisition for clients in high value, information-intensive markets or verticals,\u201d including financial services, education, home services and business-to-business technology. Our clients include some of the world's largest companies and brands in those markets. While the majority of our operations and revenue are in North America, we also have emerging businesses in Brazil and India.\nWe deliver measurable and cost-effective marketing results to our clients, typically in the form of a qualified lead, inquiry, click, call, application, or customer. Leads, inquiries, clicks, calls, and applications can then convert into a customer or sale for clients at a rate that results in an acceptable marketing cost to them. We are typically paid by clients when we deliver qualified leads, inquiries, clicks, calls, applications, or customers as defined by our agreements with them. References to the delivery of customers means a sale or completed customer transaction (e.g., bound insurance policies or customer appointments with clients). Because we bear the costs of media, our programs must result in attractive marketing costs to our clients at media costs and margins that provide sound financial outcomes for us. To deliver leads, inquiries, clicks, calls, applications, and customers to our clients, generally we:\n \u2022 own or access targeted media through business arrangements (e.g., revenue sharing arrangements) or by purchasing media (e.g., clicks from major search engines); \n \u2022 run advertisements or other forms of marketing messages and programs in that media to create visitor responses typically in the form of leads or inquiries (e.g., contact information), clicks (to further qualification or matching steps, or to online client applications or offerings), calls (to our owned and operated call centers or that of our clients or their agents), applications (e.g., for enrollment or a financial product), or customers (e.g., bound insurance policies); \n \u2022 match these leads, inquiries, clicks, calls, applications, or customers to client offerings or brands that we believe can meet visitor interests or needs and client targets and requirements; and \n \u2022 optimize client matches and media costs such that we achieve desired results for clients and a sound financial outcome for us. \nOur primary financial objective has been and remains creating revenue growth from sustainable sources, at target levels of profitability. Our primary financial objective is not to maximize profits, but rather to achieve target levels of profitability while investing in various growth initiatives, as we continue to believe we are in the early stages of a large, long-term market opportunity.\nOur business derives its net revenue from fees earned through the delivery of qualified leads, inquiries, clicks, calls, applications, or customers and, to a lesser extent, display advertisements, or impressions. Through a vertical focus, targeted media presence and our technology platform, we are able to deliver targeted, measurable marketing results to our clients.\nOur two largest client verticals are financial services and education. Our financial services client vertical represented 70%, 62% and 52% of net revenue in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016. Our education client vertical represented 19%, 24% and 30% of net revenue in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016. Our other client vertical, consisting of home services and business-to-business technology, represented 11%, 14% and 18% of net revenue in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016. We generated the majority of our revenue from sales to clients in the United States.\nTrends Affecting our Business\nClient Verticals\nTo date, we have generated the majority of our revenue from clients in our financial services and education client verticals. We expect that a majority of our revenue in fiscal year 2019 will continue to be generated from clients in these two client verticals.\nOur financial services client vertical has been challenged by a number of factors in the past, including the limited availability of high quality media at acceptable margins caused by acquisition of media sources by competitors, increased competition for high quality media and changes in search engine algorithms. These effects may impact our business in the future again. To offset this impact, we have enhanced our product set to provide greater segmentation, matching, transparency and right pricing of media that have enabled better monetization to provide greater access to high quality media sources. Moreover, we have entered into strategic partnerships and acquisitions to increase and diversify our access to quality media and client budgets. Our financial services client vertical also benefits from more spending by clients in digital media and performance marketing as digital marketing continues to evolve.\nOur education client vertical has been significantly challenged by regulations and enforcement activity affecting U.S. for-profit education institutions over the past several years. For example, in July 2015, the Federal Trade Commission initiated an investigation of a publicly traded U.S. for-profit education client with respect to its recruiting and enrollment practices. These and other similar regulatory and enforcement activities have affected and are expected to continue to affect our clients' businesses and marketing practices, which have and may continue to, result in a decrease in these clients' spending with us and other vendors and fluctuations in the volume and mix of our business with these clients. To offset the impact these regulatory and investigative activities have had on the U.S. for-profit education clients, we have broadened our product set from our traditional lead business with the addition of better qualified and matched leads or inquiries, clicks and calls; we believe these new enhanced products better match U.S. for-profit education client needs in the current regulatory environment. We have also broadened our markets in education to include not-for-profit schools and international markets in Brazil and India. Moreover, we have entered into strategic partnerships to increase and diversify our access to quality media and client budgets.\nDevelopment, Acquisition and Retention of High Quality Targeted Media\nOne of the primary challenges of our business is finding or creating media that is high quality and targeted enough to attract prospects for our clients at costs that provide a sound financial outcome for us. In order to grow our business, we must be able to find, develop and retain quality targeted media on a cost-effective basis. Consolidation of media sources, changes in search engine algorithms and increased competition for available media has, during some periods, limited and may continue to limit our ability to generate revenue at acceptable margins. To offset this impact, we have developed new sources of media, including entering into strategic partnerships with other marketing and media companies and acquisitions. Such partnerships include takeovers of performance marketing functions for large web media properties; backend monetization of unmatched traffic for clients with large media buys; and white label products for other performance marketing companies. We have also focused on growing our revenue from email, mobile and social media traffic sources.\nSeasonality\nOur results are subject to significant fluctuation as a result of seasonality. In particular, our quarters ending December 31 (our second fiscal quarter) are typically characterized by seasonal weakness. In our second fiscal quarters, there is lower availability of lead supply from some forms of media during the holiday period on a cost effective basis and some of our clients have lower budgets. In our quarters ending March 31 (our third fiscal quarter), this trend generally reverses with better lead availability and often new budgets at the beginning of the year for our clients with fiscal years ending December 31.\nOur results are also subject to fluctuation as a result of seasonality in our clients' business. For example, revenue in our clients' lending businesses is subject to cyclical and seasonal trends. Home sales typically rise during the spring and summer months and decline during the fall and winter months, while refinancing and home equity activity is principally driven by mortgage interest rates as well as real estate values. Other factors affecting our clients' businesses include macro factors such as credit availability in the market, the strength of the economy and employment.\nRegulations\nOur revenue has fluctuated in part as a result of federal, state and industry-based regulations and developing standards with respect to the enforcement of those regulations. Our business is affected directly because we operate websites and conduct telemarketing and email marketing, and indirectly affected as our clients adjust their operations as a result of regulatory changes and enforcement activity that affect their industries.\nClients in our financial services vertical have been affected by laws and regulations and the increased enforcement of new and pre-existing laws and regulations. In addition, our education client vertical has been significantly affected by the adoption of regulations affecting U.S. for-profit education institutions over the past several years, and a high level of governmental scrutiny is expected to continue. The effect of these regulations, or any future regulations, may continue to result in fluctuations in the volume and mix of our business with these clients.\nAn example of a regulatory change that may affect our business is the amendment of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (the TCPA\u201d) that affects telemarketing calls. Our clients may make business decisions based on their own experiences with the TCPA regardless of our products and compliance practices. Those decisions may negatively affect our revenue or profitability.\nBasis of Presentation\nNet Revenue\nOur business generates revenue from fees earned through the delivery of qualified leads, inquiries, clicks, calls, applications, customers and, to a lesser extent, display advertisements, or impressions. We deliver targeted and measurable results through a vertical focus that we classify into the following client verticals: financial services, education and other\u201d (which includes home services and business-to-business technology).\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists primarily of media and marketing costs, personnel costs, amortization of intangible assets, depreciation expense and amortization of internal software development costs related to revenue-producing technologies. Media and marketing costs consist primarily of fees paid to third-party publishers, media owners or managers, or to strategic partners that are directly related to a revenue-generating event and of pay-per-click, or PPC, ad purchases from Internet search companies. We pay these third-party publishers, media owners or managers, strategic partners and Internet search companies on a revenue-share, a cost-per-lead, or CPL, cost-per-click, or CPC, or cost-per-thousand-impressions, or CPM, basis. Personnel costs include salaries, stock-based compensation expense, bonuses, commissions and employee benefit costs. Personnel costs are primarily related to individuals associated with maintaining our servers and websites, our call center operations, our editorial staff, client management, creative team, content, compliance group and media purchasing analysts. Costs associated with software incurred in the development phase or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized in cost of revenue over the software's estimated useful life.\nOperating Expenses\nWe classify our operating expenses into three categories: product development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative. Our operating expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and, to a lesser extent, professional services fees, facilities fees and other costs. Personnel costs for each category of operating expenses generally include salaries, stock-based compensation expense, bonuses, commissions and employee benefit costs.\nProduct Development. Product development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, facilities fees and professional services fees related to the development and maintenance of our products and media management platform. We are constraining expenses generally to the extent practicable.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, facilities fees and professional services fees. We are constraining expenses generally to the extent practicable.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs of our finance, legal, employee benefits and compliance, technical support and other administrative personnel, as well as accounting and legal professional services fees and facilities fees. We are constraining expenses generally to the extent practicable.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net\nInterest and other income (expense), net, consists primarily of interest income, interest expense, and other income and expense. Interest income represents interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents, which may increase or decrease depending on market interest rates and the amounts invested. Interest expense is related to our revolving loan facility which matured in June 2017, promissory notes issued in connection with our acquisitions, and imputed interest on non-interest bearing notes. We have no borrowing agreements outstanding as of June 30, 2018; however interest expense could increase if, among other things, we enter into a new borrowing agreement to manage liquidity or make additional acquisitions through debt financing. Other income and expense includes gains and losses on foreign currency exchange, gains and losses on sales of websites and domain names that were not considered to be strategically important to our business, impairment of investments and other non-operating items.\nBenefit from (Provision for) Income Taxes\nWe are subject to tax in the United States as well as other tax jurisdictions or countries in which we conduct business. Earnings from our limited non-U.S. activities are subject to local country income tax and may be subject to U.S. income tax.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated

compared to fiscal year 2017. Our financial services client vertical revenue increased $98.3 million, or 53%, primarily due to our enhanced product set that provides greater segmentation, matching, transparency, and right pricing of media which have enabled access to more media and client budgets and to additional strategic partnerships that have increased and diversified our access to quality media and client budgets. Our education client vertical revenue increased $5.1 million, or 7%, primarily due to increased client demand from not-for-profit education clients. Revenue from other client vertical increased by $1.1 million, or 3%, primarily due to increased client demand in our home services client vertical, partially offset by decreased client demand in our business-to-business technology vertical.\nNet revenue increased $2.1 million, or 1%, in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. Our financial services client vertical revenue increased $29.6 million, or 19%, primarily due to our enhanced product set that provides greater segmentation, transparency, and right pricing of media which have enabled access to more media and client budgets and to additional strategic partnerships that have increased and diversified our access to quality media and client budgets. Our education client vertical revenue decreased $18.0 million, or 20%, primarily due to exits from the channel of some for-profit education clients, decreased client demand as a result of client initiatives which include campus closures and discontinuation of certain education programs and lower budgets from certain education clients. Revenue from other client vertical decreased $9.5 million, or 18%, primarily due to decreased client demand in our business-to-business technology and medical client verticals, partially offset by increased client demand in our home services client vertical.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Profit Margin\nCost of revenue increased $76.5 million, or 28%, in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017. This was primarily driven by increased media and marketing costs of $81.1 million due to higher revenue volumes, as well as increased stock-based compensation expense of $0.9 million. This was primarily offset by decreased personnel costs of $2.3 million, mainly as a result of decreased average headcount in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 and a decrease of $3.4 million in depreciation and amortization expense. The decrease in personnel costs is primarily related to our corporate restructuring announced in November 2016. The decrease in amortization of intangible assets is attributable to assets from historical acquisitions becoming fully amortized. Depreciation expense declined due to decreased capital investing in recent periods. Gross profit margin, which is the difference between net revenue and cost of revenue as a percentage of net revenue, was 14% in fiscal year 2018 compared to 10% in fiscal year 2017. The increase in gross profit margin was attributable to decreased personnel costs and decreased amortization of intangible assets as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by a higher proportion of our revenue coming from our financial services client vertical, which tend to have higher media and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue.\nCost of revenue decreased $1.6 million, or 1%, in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, driven by decreased personnel costs of $5.6 million, decreased amortization of intangible assets of $2.7 million, decreased stock-based compensation expense of $0.7 million and decreased depreciation expense of $0.5 million, partially offset by increased media and marketing costs of $8.2 million. The decrease in personnel costs is primarily related to our corporate restructuring announced in November 2016 and decreased incentive compensation associated with the lower achievement of performance objectives. The decrease in amortization of intangible assets is attributable to assets from historical acquisitions becoming fully amortized and decreased spending in recent periods. The increase in media and marketing costs is primarily due to higher revenue volumes from our financial services client vertical, which tend to have higher media and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue. Gross profit margin, which is the difference between net revenue and cost of revenue as a percentage of net revenue, was 10% in fiscal year 2017 compared to 9% in fiscal year 2016. The increase in gross profit margin was attributable to decreased personnel costs and decreased amortization of intangible as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by a higher proportion of our revenue coming from our financial services client vertical, which tend to have higher media and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2018 - 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2017 - 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 42,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct Development Expenses\nProduct development expenses increased $0.3 million, or 2%, in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, primarily due to increased travel expense of $0.3 million mainly attributable to travel costs incurred in connection with our foreign operations.\nProduct development expenses decreased $3.0 million, or 18%, in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily due to decreased personnel costs of $1.9 million and decreased stock-based compensation expense of $0.5 million. The decrease in personnel costs was related to our corporate restructuring announced in November 2016 and decreased performance incentive compensation associated with the lower achievement of performance objectives.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses increased $1.2 million, or 13%, in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, primarily due to increased personnel costs associated with higher compensation costs and increased performance incentive compensation associated with the achievement of higher performance objectives.\nSales and marketing expenses decreased $2.8 million, or 24%, in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily due to decreased personnel costs of $1.7 million and decreased stock-based compensation expense of $0.7 million. The decrease in personnel costs was related to our corporate restructuring announced in November 2016 and decreased performance incentive compensation associated with the lower achievement of performance objectives.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $2.6 million, or 16%, in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, primarily due to increased personnel costs of $0.8 million, increased legal expense of $0.6 million, and increased professional fees of $0.6 million. The increase in personnel costs was related to increased performance incentive compensation associated with the higher achievement of performance objectives. The increase in legal expense was due to higher expenses related to compliance matters. The increase in professional services fees was due to the material weakness identified in fiscal year 2017.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $1.2 million, or 7%, in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily due to decreased personnel costs of $0.7 million and decreased litigation expense of $0.5 million. The decrease in personnel costs was related to our corporate restructuring announced in November 2016 and decreased performance incentive compensation associated with the lower achievement of performance objectives. The decrease in litigation expense was due to lower legal settlements.\nRestructuring Charges\nIn November 2016, we announced a corporate restructuring in order to accelerate margin expansion and grow cash flow. As a result, we recognized total cash and non-cash restructuring costs of $2.4 million related to employee severance and benefits in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, which represented substantially all costs expected to be incurred associated with the corporate restructuring. Benefits from the restructuring began to take effect in the three months ended December 31, 2016 and the restructuring was complete as of June 30, 2017.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2018 - 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2017 - 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (346\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (585\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (41\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,416\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2257\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,624\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (412\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest income was immaterial in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nInterest expense decreased $0.3 million, or 100% in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, and $0.2 million, or 41% in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily due to decreased debt obligations.\nOther income (expense), net increased $3.1 million in fiscal year 2018, or 128% compared to fiscal year 2017 primarily due to the impairment of our investment in a privately held entity of $2.5 million in fiscal year 2017 and income from the sale of other assets and domain names that were not considered strategically important to our business.

income (loss) per share for the four quarters of each fiscal year may not sum to the total for the fiscal year as a result of the different number of shares outstanding during each period. \nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe include adjusted EBITDA in this report because (i) we seek to manage our business to a level of adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue, (ii) is used internally by management for planning purposes, including preparation of internal budgets; to allocate resources; to evaluate the effectiveness of operational strategies and capital expenditures as well as the capacity to service debt, (iii) it is a key basis upon which management assesses our operating performance, (iv) it is one of the primary metrics investors use in evaluating Internet marketing companies, (v) it is a factor in determining compensation, and (vi) it is an element of certain financial covenants under our historical borrowing arrangements. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) less benefit from (provision for) income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, interest and other income (expense), net, impairment of goodwill, restructuring expense, external expense related to the material weakness disclosed in our FY 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K and acquisition related expense.\nWe use adjusted EBITDA as a key performance measure because we believe it facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period by excluding potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense), tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or fluctuations in permanent differences or discrete quarterly items), non-recurring charges (such as restructuring expense, external expense related to the material weakness disclosed in our FY 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K, acquisition related expense and other income and expense) and the non-cash impact of depreciation expense, amortization expense and stock-based compensation expense.\nIn addition, we believe adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are widely used by investors, securities analysts, ratings agencies and other interested parties in our industry as a measure of financial performance, debt-service capabilities and as a metric for analyzing company valuations. Our use of adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures for capital equipment or other contractual commitments; \n \u2022 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements; \n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of issuing stock-based compensation to our management team and employees; \n \u2022 should we enter into borrowing arrangements in the future, adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements that may be necessary to service interest or principal payments on such indebtedness; \n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and \n \u2022 other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. \nDue to these limitations, adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. When evaluating our performance, adjusted EBITDA should be considered alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net (loss) income and our other GAAP results.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated:\nTable 141: <table> <tr>

We do so on a fiscal year basis by varying our operations to balance revenue growth and costs throughout the fiscal year. We do not seek to manage our business to a level of adjusted EBITDA on a quarterly basis and we expect our adjusted EBITDA margins to vary from quarter to quarter.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of June 30, 2018, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $64.7 million and cash we expect to generate from future operations. Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. We believe our cash equivalents are liquid and accessible.\nOur short-term and long-term liquidity requirements primarily arise from our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, internal software development costs and acquisitions from time to time. Our primary operating cash requirements include the payment of media costs, personnel costs, costs of information technology systems, office facilities and an unfunded lending commitment. Our ability to fund these requirements will depend on our future cash flows, which are determined, in part, by future operating performance and are, therefore, subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Even though we may not need additional funds to fund anticipated liquidity requirements, we may still elect to obtain debt financing or issue additional equity securities for other reasons.\nWe believe that our principal sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months.\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 26,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15,849\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,137\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,202\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18,505\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,497\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nCash from operating activities are primarily the result of our net income (loss) adjusted for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, impairment of investment and changes in working capital components.\nCash provided by operating activities was $27.0 million for fiscal year 2018 compared to $18.5 million for fiscal year 2017 and $1.0 million for fiscal year 2016.\nCash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2018 consisted of net income of $15.9 million, adjusted for non-cash adjustments of $17.4 million. In addition, there was a net decrease in cash from changes in working capital of $6.3 million. The non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expense of $10.2 million and depreciation and amortization of $7.8 million. The changes in working capital accounts were primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of $25.0 million primarily due to increased net revenues, offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $15.8 million, primarily due to an increase in media costs associated with increased revenue, and an increase in accrued performance incentive compensation associated with the higher achievement of performance objectives. The decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $1.9 million was primarily due to timing of payments and the decrease in other assets non-current of $1.1 million was primarily due to amortization expense for the year.\nCash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2017 consisted of a net loss of $12.2 million, which included a restructuring charge of $2.4 million, offset by non-cash adjustments of $23.0 million. In addition, there was a net increase in cash from changes in working capital of $7.8 million. The non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization of $11.4 million, stock-based compensation expense of $8.9 million and impairment of investment of $2.5 million. The changes in working capital accounts were primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $4.2 million, primarily due to the timing of cash payments, partially offset by a decrease in accrued performance incentive compensation of $2.0 million associated with the lower achievement of performance objectives. The decrease in accounts receivable of $2.9 million was primarily due to the timing of cash receipts.\nCash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2016 consisted of a net loss of $19.4 million, which included a restructuring charge of $0.3 million, offset by non-cash adjustments of $26.8 million. In addition, there was a net decrease in cash from changes in working capital of $6.3 million. The non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization of $15.1 million, stock-based compensation expense of $11.0 million, and provision for sales returns and doubtful accounts receivable of $0.8 million. The changes in working capital accounts were primarily due to an increase in other assets, noncurrent of $8.2 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $1.8 million, partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $4.5 million. The increase in other assets, noncurrent, was primarily due to a one-time $10.0 million cash payment to All Web Leads, a strategic partner, to be their exclusive click monetization partner for the majority of their insurance categories and the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the timing of cash receipts. The decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets was primarily due to a cash receipt from a federal tax refund of $6.5 million.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nCash from investing activities generally include capital expenditures, capitalized internal development costs, and acquisitions from time to time.\nCash used in investing activities was $15.8 million for fiscal year 2018, compared to $4.1 million in fiscal year 2017 and $5.2 million in fiscal year 2016.\nCash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to our acquisition of certain assets of Katch, LLC for $14.0 million and capital expenditures and internal software development costs of $2.8 million offset by proceeds from sales of other assets and domain names of $1.1 million.\nCash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to capital expenditures and internal software development costs of $3.3 million and an increase in restricted cash of $0.8 million held as collateral for letters of credit related to our corporate headquarters' operating lease and fidelity bonds placed with an insurance company.\nCash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to capital expenditures and internal software development costs of $5.3 million.\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities\nCash from financing activities generally include repayments on loan facilities and acquisition-related notes payable, repurchases of common stock, payment of withholding taxes related to the release of restricted stock, net of share settlement and proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nCash provided by financing activities was $3.9 million for fiscal year 2018 compared to cash used of $18.5 million for fiscal year 2017 and $2.5 million for fiscal year 2016.\nCash provided by financing activities in fiscal year 2018 was due to proceeds from the exercise of common stock options of $11.0 million, offset by payment of withholding taxes related to the release of restricted stock, net of share settlement of $6.5 million and repurchases of common stock of $0.6 million.\nCash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2017 was due to repayment of the revolving loan facility of $15.0 million, repurchases of common stock of $2.5 million and payment of withholding taxes related to the release of restricted stock, net of share settlement of $1.0 million.\nCash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to payment of withholding taxes related to the release of restricted stock, net of share settlement of $2.5 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuring the periods presented, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We have an investment in a variable interest entity of which we are not the primary beneficiary and as to which we do not have any material obligations.\nAdditionally, in the third quarter of 2018, we entered into an unsecured revolving promissory note as a lender, as part of a strategic partnership intended to increase our presence in the emerging technology career education market. The principal balance at any time cannot exceed $2.5 million and any outstanding principal balance bears interest at an annual rate of 6.00% payable monthly. Repayment of the principal balance can occur without premium or penalty in whole or in part at any time. In the event of an equity offering by the borrower, any outstanding principal balance may be converted into equity securities of the borrower at the mutual agreement of us and the borrower. Any outstanding principal balance and any accrued and unpaid interest is due on January 1, 2019. As of June 30, 2018, there were no amounts outstanding.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth payments due under our contractual obligations as of June 30, 2018:\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lending Commitment(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) The lending commitment represents the unfunded balance on the unsecured revolving promissory note described under Off Balance Sheet Arrangements\u201d as of June 30, 2018. The principal balance anytime cannot exceed $2.5 million and repayment of the principal balance can occur without premium or penalty in whole or in part at any time. Refer to Note 9 for more information on the lending commitment. \nThe above table does not include approximately $2.2 million of long-term income tax liabilities for uncertainty in income taxes due to the fact that we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of these potential future payments.\nHeadquarters Lease\nWe entered into a lease agreement in February 2010 for approximately 63,998 square feet of office space located at 950 Tower Lane, Foster City, California. The term of the lease began on November 1, 2010 and expires on October 31, 2018. The monthly base rent was abated for the first 12 calendar months under the lease, and remained at $0.1 million through the 24th calendar month of the term of the lease. After this 24 month period, monthly base rent increased to $0.2 million for the subsequent 12 months and now increases approximately 3% after each 12-month anniversary during the remaining term.\nIn April 2018, we amended the lease agreement. The extended lease term period begins on November 1, 2018 and expires on October 31, 2023. Additionally, the square footage of office space was reduced to approximately 44,556. During the first year of the extended lease term, the monthly base rent will be abated for the first eight months, and increases to $0.2 million for the remaining four months. During the second year of the extended lease term, the monthly base rent will be abated for the first four months, increase to $0.2 million for the fifth month, and increase to $0.3 million for the remaining seven months. Subsequently, after each 12-month anniversary, the monthly base rent will increase by approximately 3%. We have one option to extend the term of the lease for an additional five years following October 31, 2023.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe have prepared our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). In doing so, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.\nSome of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events. We base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience or on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we reconsider and evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates.\nWe believe that the critical accounting policies listed below involve our more significant judgments, estimates and assumptions and, therefore, could have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. In addition, we believe that a discussion of these policies is necessary to understand and evaluate the consolidated financial statements contained in this report.\nSee Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Principles, of our consolidated financial statements for further information on our critical and other significant accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue earned through the delivery of qualified leads, inquiries, clicks, calls, applications, customers and, to a lesser extent, display advertisements, or impressions constituted all revenue in fiscal years 2018,"}
