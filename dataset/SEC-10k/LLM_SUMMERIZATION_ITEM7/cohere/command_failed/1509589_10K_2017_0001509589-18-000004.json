Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nExecutive Summary\nWe are a Denver-based exploration and production company focused on the extraction of oil and associated liquids-rich natural gas in the United States. Our oil and liquids-weighted assets are concentrated primarily in the Wattenberg Field in Colorado and the Dorcheat Macedonia Field in southern Arkansas.\nBankruptcy Proceedings under Chapter 11\nOn January 4, 2017, the Debtors filed voluntary petitions under Chapter 11 in the Bankruptcy Court. The Debtors received bankruptcy court confirmation of their Plan on April 7, 2017, and emerged from bankruptcy on April 28, 2017, the Effective Date. For additional information about our bankruptcy proceedings and emergence, see Note 2 - Chapter 11 Proceedings and Emergence.\nUpon emergence from bankruptcy, the Company adopted fresh-start accounting and became a new entity for financial reporting purposes. Upon adoption of fresh-start accounting, our assets and liabilities were recorded at their fair values as of the Effective Date, which differed materially from the recorded values of those same assets and liabilities in the Predecessor Company. As a result, our balance sheets and statement of operations subsequent to the Effective Date are not comparable to our balance sheets and statements of operations prior to the Effective Date. For additional information about our application of fresh-start accounting, see Note 3 - Fresh-Start Accounting.\nEmployment Modifications\nOn June 5, 2017, our board of directors approved and the Company adopted the Fourth Amended and Restated Executive Change in Control and Severance Benefit Plan (the Severance Plan\u201d). The Severance Plan entitles certain executives and key employees to specific severance benefits and accelerated vesting of stock awards upon a qualifying termination from the Company. These benefits are subject to certain limitations including a reduction of the cash severance payment by the intrinsic value of the individual's unvested Management Incentive Plan awards (granted on the Effective Date) on a dollar-for-dollar basis.\nOn June 11, 2017, Richard J. Carty resigned as a member of the board of directors and left his role as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Mr. Carty received accelerated vesting of the equity awards he was granted on the Effective Date, which awards were in accordance with the Plan and approved by the prior board of directors. The accelerated awards consisted of 137,814 non-qualified stock options with a $34.36 strike price, which were forfeited as they had to be exercised within 90 days of the termination effective date, and 137,814 restricted stock units. The grant-date fair value of the options and restricted stock units was $17.42 and $34.36, respectively, resulting in a one-time non-cash stock-based compensation charge of $7.1 million. The exercisable value of the equity grants on the effective date of termination was $4.3 million. There was no cash severance provided in accordance with the terms of the Severance Plan.\nDuring 2017, the Company implemented a series of cost reductions that included a reduction in workforce and operating expenses. These reductions resulted in one-time cash severance charges of approximately $1.6 million and anticipated operating expense implementation fees of approximately $2.0 million to $3.0 million to be incurred in 2018. The anticipated annualized impact of this action is a reduction in recurring cash general and administrative expense of approximately $10.0 million and operating expenses of $10.0 million. The operating cost reductions will be implemented throughout the coming year and are anticipated to be fully realized by the beginning of 2019. The Company continues to review its costs to better align its cost structure with the current commodity price environment.\nThe Company is actively pursuing the permanent placement of leadership to carryout the planned growth and development plans of the Company.\nFinancial and Operating Results\nOur 2017 financial and operational results include:\nTable 230: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Total liquidity of $204.4 million at December 31, 2017, consisting of, year-end cash balance plus funds available under the successor credit facility, as compared with $38.9 million, consisting of, the year-end cash balance net of the borrowing base deficiency under the predecessor credit facility at December 31, 2016.

The program contemplates running one rig in the first half of 2018 with a second rig added at mid-year to coincide with additional gas processing capacity. The 2018 program is expected to grow Wattenberg annual production by approximately 20% in 2018 and greater than 50% in 2019, assuming a continuous two rig program. Allocated capital associated with this program is expected to be approximately $280.0 million to $320.0 million, which will support drilling 90 gross wells and turning online 55 gross wells in 2018.\nIn order to focus and partially fund its core asset development, the Company elected, subsequent to year-end, to actively pursue divesting of its Mid-Continent region and North Park Basin. The Company successfully sold its North Park Basin on March 9, 2018 for $0.1 million and full release of all current and future obligations.\nIn order to help achieve the Company's strategies, we are actively seeking to secure permanent leadership.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The decreased volumes are a direct result of the Company suspending drilling and completion activities through the majority of 2016 and the first half of 2017. During the period from December 31, 2016 through December 31, 2017, we completed 10.0 net operated wells in the Rocky Mountain region and no wells in the Mid-Continent region.\nThe following table

Our lease operating expense decreased $4.7 million or 11%, to $39.0 million for the Current Successor and Predecessor Periods from $43.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 but increased on an equivalent basis from $5.50 per Boe to $6.68 per Boe due to reduced production. The Company eliminated significant amounts of compression and labor costs resulting in a decrease in total compression costs of $4.1 million for the Current Successor and Predecessor Period when compared to the same period in 2016.\nGas plant and midstream operating expense. Our gas plant and midstream operating expense decreased $0.9 million to $11.9 million for the Current Successor and Predecessor Period from $12.8 million for the Prior Predecessor Period but increased on an equivalent basis from $1.62 per Boe to $2.04 per Boe due to reduced production. Gas plant and midstream operating expense on an aggregate basis is commensurate between the comparable periods.\nSeverance and ad valorem taxes. Our severance and ad valorem taxes remained constant between the Current Successor and Predecessor Period and the Prior Predecessor Period. Severance and ad valorem taxes primarily correlate to revenue. Revenues decreased by 1% for the Current Successor and Predecessor Period when compared to the same period in 2016.\nExploration. Our exploration expense increased $6.5 million to $7.4 million for the Current Successor and Predecessor Period from $0.9 million for the comparable period in 2016. During the Current Successor and Predecessor Period we paid $3.8 million in delay rentals, incurred $2.9 million on abandoned well projects and $0.7 million in geological and geophysical expenses. During the Prior Predecessor Period, we incurred $0.9 million on abandoned well projects.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization. Our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense per Boe was $5.66, $13.54 and $14.01 for the Current Successor Period, Current Predecessor Period and Prior Predecessor Period. The Current Successor Period reflects the $310.6 million fair value downward adjustment to the depletable asset base upon adoption of fresh-start accounting.\nImpairment of oil and gas properties. There were no impairment of oil and gas properties during the Current Successor and Predecessor Periods. During the Prior Predecessor Period, we incurred a $10.0 million impairment charge on our Mid-Continent assets based on the most recent bid received during the first quarter of 2016, when they were held for sale. Please refer to Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion on our impairment policy and practice.\nAbandonment and impairment of unproved properties. There were no abandonment and impairment of unproved properties during the Current Successor and Predecessor Periods. During the Prior Predecessor Period, we incurred an abandonment and impairment of unproved properties charge of $24.7 million due to non-core leases expiring within the Wattenberg Field.\nUnused commitments. There were no unused commitments during the Current Successor Period. During the Current Predecessor Period, we incurred $1.0 million in unused commitment fees on a water supply contract in the Wattenberg Field. During the Prior Predecessor Period, we incurred unused commitment fees of $7.7 million, made up of $4.3 million water commitment deficiency payments and $3.4 million purchase and transportation deficiency payments. Please see Note 8 - Commitments and Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion.\nContract settlement expense. There were no contract settlement expenses during the Current Successor and Predecessor Periods. During the Prior Predecessor Period, we incurred a $21.0 million loss to settle our crude oil purchase agreement with Silo as part of our bankruptcy process. Please see Note 8 - Commitments and Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion.\nGeneral and administrative expense. Our general and administrative expense per Boe was $11.34, $7.28 and $9.71 for the Current Successor Period, Current Predecessor Period and Prior Predecessor Period. The Current Successor Period reflects a one-time cash and non-cash $9.6 million or $2.55 per Boe severance charge primarily related to the Company's former Chief Executive Officer's separation from the Company. The Prior Predecessor Period includes $13.3 million or $1.68 per Boe more of advisor fees than the comparable period in 2017. Excluding those two items the per Boe metrics are commensurate between the periods presented.\nDerivative gain (loss). Our derivative loss for the Current Successor Period was $15.4 million. We had no derivative contracts during the Current Predecessor Period. During the Current Successor Period, we entered into several oil and gas costless collar and swap contracts. Our derivative loss is mainly due to fair market value adjustments caused by market prices being higher than our contracted hedge prices. Our derivative loss for the Prior Predecessor Period was $11.2 million. Due to the Company being in default on the predecessor credit facility, all of these derivative contracts in the Prior Predecessor Period were terminated during the fourth quarter of 2016. Please see Note 13 - Derivatives in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion.\nInterest expense. Our interest expense for the Current Successor Period, Current Predecessor Period and Prior Predecessor Period was $0.8 million, $5.7 million and $62.1 million. Upon filing its petition for Chapter 11, the Company ceased accruing interest expense on its Senior Notes. The Company incurred $0.7 million in commitment fees on the available borrowing base under the successor credit facility during the Current Successor Period. Interest expense on the Senior Notes was $1.0 million and $52.3 million for the Current Predecessor Period and Prior Predecessor Period, respectively, with the remaining interest expense relating to the predecessor credit facility. The Company had no outstanding debt during the Current Successor Period. Average debt outstanding for the Current Predecessor Period and Prior Predecessor Period was $991.7 million and $1.0 billion, respectively.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended

expense. Our lease operating expense decreased $21.4 million or 33%, to $43.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $65.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and decreased on an equivalent basis from $6.30 per Boe to $5.50 per Boe. The majority of the decrease is due to continued operating cost reductions along with decreased activity levels. The Company reduced operating costs and negotiated contract reductions resulting in decreased well servicing costs of $10.1 million, compression costs of $4.9 million and pumping and gauging costs of $2.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015.\nGas plant and midstream operating expense. Our gas plant and midstream operating expense increased $1.5 million to $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and increased on an equivalent basis from $1.10 per Boe to $1.62 per Boe. The increase in aggregate and on an equivalent basis is due to the start-up and continued buildout of RMI, which began in May of 2015.\nSeverance and ad valorem taxes. Our severance and ad valorem taxes decreased by 18%, or $3.3 million to $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Severance and ad valorem taxes primarily correlate to revenue. Revenues decreased by 33% for the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, which was offset by a tax refund received during the third quarter of 2015.\nExploration. Our exploration expense decreased $14.9 million to $0.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 from $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred minimal exploration charges. During the year ended December 31, 2015 we incurred charges of $5.6 million and $8.5 million for exploratory wells located in the North Park Basin and outside of our current development area in southern Arkansas, respectively, which we were unable to assign economic proved reserves. During 2015, we also paid $1.0 million and $0.7 million in geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals, respectively.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization. Our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense decreased $133.7 million, or 55%, to $111.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $244.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and decreased on an equivalent basis from $23.73 per Boe to $14.01 per Boe. The Company realized significant proved property impairments during the fourth quarter of 2015 resulting in a 50% decrease in the net proved property depletable base from the year ended December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016.\nImpairment of oil and gas properties. For the year ended December 31, 2016 we incurred an impairment of proved properties of $10.0 million, a $730.5 million decrease from the year ended December 31, 2015. We impaired our Mid-Continent assets by $10.0 million based on the most recent bid received during the first quarter of 2016, when it was held for sale. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we impaired our Mid-Continent assets by $321.2 million due to their depressed fair value upon classification as held for sale and our Rocky Mountain assets by $419.3 million due to low commodity prices. Please refer to Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion on our impairment policy and practice.\nAbandonment and impairment of unproved properties. For the year ended December 31, 2016 we incurred an abandonment and impairment of unproved properties of $24.7 million, an $8.9 million decrease from the prior year. Our 2016 abandonment and impairment charges related to non-core leases expiring within the Wattenberg Field. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $24.8 million of impairment charges relating to non-core leases expiring within the Wattenberg Field and $8.7 million of impairment charges to fully impair the North Park Basin due to a strategic shift in our development plan.\nUnused commitments. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $7.7 million in unused commitment fees. During 2015, we did not incur any fees of this nature. The unused commitment fees in 2016 of $4.3 million and $3.4 million are the result of water commitment deficiency payments and purchase and transportation agreement deficiency payments, respectively. Please see Note 8 - Commitments and Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion.\nContract settlement expense. For the year ended December 31, 2016 we incurred a $21.0 million loss to settle our crude oil purchase agreement with Silo as part of our bankruptcy process. There were no material settlements during 2015. Please see Note 8 - Commitments and Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion.\nGeneral and administrative expense. Our general and administrative expense increased $6.7 million, or 10%, to $77.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $70.3 million for the comparable period in 2015 and increased on an equivalent basis to $9.71 per Boe from $6.81 per Boe. The increase in general and administrative expense in 2016 on an aggregate and equivalent basis is due to $20.4 million of advisory fees related to our restructuring efforts and an increase of $1.2 million in severance payments. These cost increases were offset by a decrease in salaries and wages, including benefits of $9.3 million and stock compensation of $5.7 million due to reductions in workforce that have occurred since December 31, 2015.\nDerivative gain (loss). Our derivative loss increased $67.8 million to an $11.2 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 from a gain of $56.6 million for the comparable period in 2015. The decrease is related to a reduction of hedged volumes throughout 2016 and decreased contract prices at the time of conversion from three-way collars to swap and puts at the end of the first quarter of 2016 bringing them closer to realized prices during the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015. Please refer to Note 13 - Derivatives in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion.\nInterest expense. Our interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased 9% to $62.1 million compared to $57.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The interest expense increase is a result of increased average debt outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $1.0 billion, compared to $847.9 million for the comparable period in 2015. Total interest expense is comprised primarily of interest expense attributable to the Senior Notes including amortization\nof the premium and financing costs, which was $52.3 million and $52.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nIncome tax benefit (expense). Our estimate for federal and state income tax benefit for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was zero and $164.9 million, respectively. We are allowed to deduct various items for tax reporting purposes that are capitalized for purposes of financial statement presentation. Our effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was 0.0% and 18.1%, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, a full valuation was placed against the net deferred tax assets, which caused effective tax rate to differ from the U.S. statutory income tax rate.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe successor Company's anticipated sources of liquidity include cash from operating activities, borrowings under the successor credit facility, proceeds from sales of assets and potential proceeds from capital market transactions. Our cash flows from operating activities are subject to significant volatility due to changes in commodity prices for our crude oil, NGL and natural gas products, as well as variations in our production. The prices for these commodities are driven by a number of factors beyond our control, including global and regional product supply and demand, weather, product distribution, refining and processing capacity and other supply chain dynamics, among other factors.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our liquidity was $204.4 million, consisting of cash on hand of $12.7 million and $191.7 million of available borrowing capacity on the successor credit facility. As of the date of filing, we had $15.0 million outstanding on our successor credit facility.\nOn April 7, 2017, the Company's Plan was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, and the Plan became effective on April 28, 2017. Upon emergence from bankruptcy, we (i) executed the successor credit facility with an initial borrowing base of $191.7 million and maturity date of March 31, 2021 and (ii) issued new common stock as part of the $200.0 million rights offering and the $7.5 million transaction with the ad hoc equity committee. Please refer to Note 2 - Chapter 11 Proceedings and Emergence for additional details.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows and other financial measures for the periods indicated (in thousands).\nTable 247: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Successor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Predecessor\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>April 29, 2017 through December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 1, 2017 through April 28, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(19,884\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>226,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(82,648\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,904\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(67,401\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(452,573\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>(2,398\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>245,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>12,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition of oil and gas properties\n</td> <td>5,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Exploration and development of oil and gas properties\n</td> <td>76,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>425,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash flows provided by operating activities\nThe Current Successor Period included cash receipts and disbursements attributable to our normal operating cycle. The Current Predecessor Period contained the reorganization costs along with our normal operating receipts and disbursements. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities between the year ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 resulted primarily from a 13% decrease in crude oil equivalent pricing and a 23% decrease in sales volumes and a $112.7 million decrease in derivative cash settlements. See Results of Operations above for more information on the factors driving these changes.\nCash flows used in investing activities\nExpenditures for development of oil and natural gas properties are the primary use of our capital resources. The Company spent $81.8 million, $5.6 million, $52.4 million and $442.2 million for Current Successor Period, Current\nPredecessor Period, Prior Predecessor Periods for 2016 and 2015. The fluctuation in cash flows in investing activities is a direct result of the Company's entrance and emergence from bankruptcy.\nCash flows provided by financing activities\nNet cash used by financing activities for the Current Successor Period consisted of employee tax withholdings in exchanges for the return of common stock. Net cash provided by financing activities for the Current Predecessor Period consisted of proceeds from the rights offering of $207.5 million net of the $191.7 million repayment to the predecessor credit facility. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted primarily of net proceeds from the predecessor credit facility of $112.7 million. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of $202.7 million of net proceeds from the sale of common stock plus net borrowings of $46.0 million from our predecessor credit facility.\nCredit facility\nSuccessor Credit Facility\nThe administrative agent of our $191.7 million successor credit facility is KeyBank National Association. The successor credit facility provides for interest rates plus an applicable margin to be determined based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) or a base rate ( Base Rate\u201d), at the Company's election. LIBOR borrowings bear interest at LIBOR plus 3.00% to 4.00% depending on the utilization level, and the Base Rate borrowings bear interest at the Reference Rate,\u201d as defined in the successor credit facility, plus 2.00% to 3.00%.\nOur approved borrowing base under the successor credit facility, which was $191.7 million as of December 31, 2017, is redetermined semiannually as early as April and October of each year and up to one additional time between such scheduled determinations upon our request or upon the request of the required lenders (defined as lenders holding 662/3% of the aggregate commitments). The borrowing base is determined by the value of our oil and gas reserves but also takes into consideration such information as a repayment analysis of the Company's debt and the forecasted financial condition of the Company. The borrowing base is redetermined (i) in the sole discretion of the administrative agent and all of the lenders, (ii) in accordance with their customary internal standards and practices for valuing and redetermining the value of oil and gas properties in connection with reserve based oil and natural gas loan transactions, (iii) in conjunction with the most recent engineering report and other information received by the administrative agent and the lenders relating to our proved reserves and (iv) based upon the estimated value of our proved reserves as determined by the administrative agent and the lenders.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had nothing outstanding under the successor credit facility and had the ability to borrow up to the borrowing base of $191.7 million.\nOur obligations under the successor credit facility are secured by first priority liens on all of our property and assets (whether real, personal, or mixed, tangible or intangible), including our proved reserves and our oil and gas properties (which term is defined to include fee mineral interests, term mineral interests, leases, subleases, farm-outs, royalties, overriding royalties, net profit interests, carried interests, production payments, back in interests and reversionary interests). The successor credit facility is guaranteed by the Company and all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries.\nThe applicable margin varies on a daily basis based on the percentage outstanding under the borrowing base. We incur quarterly commitment fees based on the unused amount of the borrowing base of 0.50% per annum. We may prepay loans under the successor credit facility at any time without premium or penalty (other than customary LIBOR breakage costs).\nThe successor credit facility contains various covenants limiting our ability to:\nTable 248: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>grant or assume liens;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 249: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>incur or assume indebtedness;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 250: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>grant negative pledges or agree to restrict dividends or distributions from subsidiaries;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 251: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>sell, transfer, assign or convey assets, or engage in certain mergers or acquisitions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 252: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>make certain distributions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 253: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>make certain loans, advances and investments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 254: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>materially change the character of our business as an oil and gas exploration and production company\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 255: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>engage in transactions with affiliates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 256: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>purchase or carry any margin stock;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 257: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>enter into sale and leaseback, take-or-pay or hydrocarbon prepayment transactions;

The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We provide expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies, estimates and judgments below. We believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates made by management.\nMethod of accounting for oil and natural gas properties\nOil and natural gas exploration and development activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Under this method, all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized at cost when incurred, pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves. If an exploratory well does not find proved reserves, the costs of drilling the well are charged to expense. The costs of development wells are capitalized whether productive or nonproductive. All capitalized well costs and other associated costs and leasehold costs of proved properties are amortized on a unit-of-production basis over the remaining life of proved developed reserves and proved reserves, respectively.\nCosts of retired, sold or abandoned properties that constitute a part of an amortization base (partial field) are charged or credited, net of proceeds, to accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization unless doing so significantly affects the unit-of-production amortization rate for an entire field, in which case a gain or loss is recognized currently. Gains or losses from the disposal of properties are recognized currently.\nExpenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals necessary to maintain properties in operating condition are expensed as incurred. Major betterments, replacements and renewals are capitalized to the appropriate property and equipment accounts. Estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs for oil and natural gas properties are capitalized, net of salvage, at their estimated net present value and amortized on a unit-of-production basis over the remaining life of the related proved developed reserves.\nUnproved properties consist of costs incurred to acquire unproved leases, or lease acquisition costs. Unproved lease acquisition costs are capitalized until the leases expire or when we specifically identify leases that will revert to the lessor, at\nwhich time we expense the associated unproved lease acquisition costs. The expensing or expiration of unproved lease acquisition costs are recorded as abandonment or impairment of unproved properties in the statements of operations and comprehensive income in our consolidated financial statements. Lease acquisition costs related to successful exploratory drilling are reclassified to proved properties and depleted on a unit-of-production basis.\nFor sales of entire working interests in unproved properties, gain or loss is recognized to the extent of the difference between the proceeds received and the net carrying value of the property. Proceeds from sales of partial interests in unproved properties are accounted for as a recovery of costs unless the proceeds exceed the entire cost of the property.\nOil and natural gas reserve quantities and Standardized Measure\nIn the current year, our third-party petroleum consultant prepared our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and associated future net revenues. In the two years prior, our internal corporate reservoir engineering group prepared, and our third-party petroleum consultant audited our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and associated future net revenues. While the SEC has adopted rules which allow us to disclose proved, probable and possible reserves, we have elected to disclose only proved reserves in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The SEC's revised rules define proved reserves as the quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. Our internal corporate reservoir engineering group and our third party petroleum consultant must make a number of subjective assumptions based on their professional judgment in developing reserve estimates. Reserve estimates are updated annually and consider recent production levels and other technical information about each field. Oil and natural gas reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be precisely measured. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment.\nPeriodic revisions to the estimated reserves and future cash flows may be necessary as a result of a number of factors, including reservoir performance, oil and natural gas prices, cost changes, technological advances, new geological or geophysical data, or other economic factors. Accordingly, reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. We cannot predict the amounts or timing of future reserve revisions. If such revisions are significant, they could significantly affect future amortization of capitalized costs and result in impairment of assets that may be material.\nRevenue recognition\nRevenue from our interests in producing wells is recognized when the product is delivered, at which time the customer has taken title and assumed the risks and rewards of ownership, and collectability is reasonably assured. The sales prices for oil and natural gas are adjusted for transportation and other related deductions. These deductions are based on contractual or historical data and do not require significant judgment.\nSubsequently, these revenue deductions are adjusted to reflect actual charges based on third-party documents. Since there is a ready market for oil and natural gas, we sell the majority of production soon after it is produced at various locations.\nImpairment of proved properties\nWe review our proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value may have occurred and at least annually. We estimate the expected undiscounted future cash flows of our oil and natural gas properties and compare such undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the oil and natural gas properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, we will adjust the carrying amount of the oil and natural gas properties to fair value. The factors used to determine fair value are subject to our judgment and expertise and include, but are not limited to, recent sales prices of comparable properties, the present value of future cash flows, net of estimated operating and development costs using estimates of proved reserves, future commodity pricing, future production estimates, anticipated capital expenditures, and various discount rates commensurate with the risk and current market conditions associated with realizing the expected cash flows projected. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these factors, we cannot predict when or if future impairment charges for proved properties will be recorded.\nImpairment of unproved properties\nWe assess our unproved properties periodically for impairment on a property-by-property basis based on remaining lease terms, drilling results or future plans to develop acreage and record abandonment and impairment expense for any decline in value.\nWe have historically recognized abandonment and impairment expense for unproved properties at the time when the lease term has expired or sooner if, in management's judgment, the unproved properties have lost some or all of their carrying value. We consider the following factors in our assessment of the impairment of unproved properties:\nTable 273: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the remaining amount of unexpired term under our leases;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 274: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our ability to actively manage and prioritize our capital expenditures to drill leases and to make payments to extend leases that may be closer to expiration;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 275: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our ability to exchange lease positions with other companies that allow for higher concentrations of ownership and development;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 276: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our ability to convey partial mineral ownership to other companies in exchange for their drilling of leases; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 277: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our evaluation of the continuing successful results from the application of completion technology in the Wattenberg Field by us or by other operators in areas adjacent to or near our unproved properties.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe assessment of unproved properties to determine any possible impairment requires significant judgment.\nAsset retirement obligations\nWe record the fair value of a liability for a legal obligation to retire an asset in the period in which the liability is incurred with the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. For oil and gas properties, this is the period in which the well is drilled or acquired. The asset retirement obligation ( ARO\u201d) for oil and gas properties represents the estimated amount we will incur to plug, abandon and remediate the properties at the end of their productive lives, in accordance with applicable state laws. The liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated on the unit-of-production method. The accretion expense is recorded as a component of depreciation, depletion and amortization in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nWe determine the ARO by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows related to the liability. Estimating the future ARO requires management to make estimates and judgments regarding timing, existence of a liability, as well as what constitutes adequate restoration. Inherent in the fair value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate costs, inflation factors, credit-adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the fair value of the existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the related asset.\nDerivatives\nWe record all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at their estimated fair value. We have not designated any derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes and we do not enter into such instruments for speculative trading purposes. Derivative instruments are adjusted to fair value every accounting period. Derivative cash settlements and gains and losses from valuation changes in the remaining unsettled commodity derivative instruments are reported under derivative gain (loss) in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nStock-based compensation\nRestricted Stock Units. We recognize compensation expense for all restricted stock units made to employees and directors. Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. The fair value of restricted stock grants is based on the value of our common stock on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation expense recorded for restricted stock units is included in general and administrative expenses on our accompanying statements of operations.\nStock Options. We recognize compensation expense for all stock option awards made to employees. Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. The fair value of stock option grants is based on a Black-Scholes Model. Stock-based compensation expense recorded for stock option awards is included in general and administrative expenses on our accompanying statements of operations.\nIncome taxes\nOur provision for taxes includes both federal and state taxes. We record our federal income taxes in accordance with accounting for income taxes under GAAP which results in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance would be established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized.\nWe apply significant judgment in evaluating our tax positions and estimating our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The actual outcome of these future tax consequences could differ significantly from our estimates, which could impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe also account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with GAAP by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires that we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. We did not have any uncertain tax positions as of the year ended December 31, 2017.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. Several additional related updates have been issued since that point. In summary, revenue recognition would occur upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance also requires enhanced financial statement disclosures over revenue recognition and provisions regarding future revenues and expenses under a gross-versus-net presentation.\nThe Company has assessed substantially all of its revenue contracts and based upon assessments performed to date, we do not expect any significant impact on the timing of revenue recognition or our financial position. The impact of any potential presentation changes will not impact our net income. The Company is currently in the process of finalizing documentation including the assessment of gross-versus-net presentation. The standard is required to be adopted using either the full retrospective approach, with all prior periods presented adjusted, or the modified retrospective approach, with a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings on the opening balance sheet. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. We adopted the new standard on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. We do not currently anticipate any adjustment to our retained earnings upon adoption.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued Update No. 2016-01 - Financial Instruments - Overall to require separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements. This authoritative guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted the new standard on January 1, 2018 and do not believe adoption will have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued Update No. 2016-02 - Leases to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. This authoritative guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company has begun the identification process of all leases and is evaluating the provisions of this guidance and assessing its impact.\nEffective January 1, 2017, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Update ( Update\u201d) No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The objective of this update was to simplify the current guidance for stock compensation. The areas for simplification involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. This update is effective for the annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. As of January 1, 2017, and thereafter, the Company did not have excess tax benefits associated with its stock compensation, and therefore, there was no tax impact upon adoption of this standard. In addition, the employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when shares were withheld for taxes have already been classified as a financing activity, therefore, there was no cash flow statement impact upon adoption of this standard. This standard allowed Company's to elect to account for forfeitures as they occurred or estimate the number of awards that will vest. The Company elected to account for forfeitures as they occur, resulting in a minimal impact upon adoption of this standard.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued Update No. 2016-15 - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which clarifies the presentation of specific cash receipts and cash payments within the statement of cash flows. This authoritative accounting guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. We adopted the new standard on January 1, 2018 and do not believe adoption will have a material impact on our statements of cash flows and related disclosures.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued Update No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash. This update clarifies how entities should present restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows by including them with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the total beginning and ending amounts for the periods shown on the statement of cash flows. This guidance is to be applied using a retrospective method and is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. We adopted the new standard on January 1, 2018 and do not believe adoption will have a material impact on our statements of cash flows and related disclosures.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued Update No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business. This update clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. This guidance is to be applied using a prospective method and is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. We adopted this new standard on January 1, 2018 and will apply it to any future acquisitions or disposals of assets or business.\nIn February 2017, the FASB issued Update No. 2017-05, Other Income-Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets (Subtopic 610-20): Clarifying the Scope of Asset Derecognition Guidance and Accounting for Partial Sales of Nonfinancial Assets. This update is meant to clarify existing guidance and to add guidance for partial sales of nonfinancial assets. This guidance is to be applied using a full retrospective method or a modified retrospective method as outlined in the guidance and is effective at the same time as Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). We adopted this new standard on January 1, 2018 and do not believe adoption will have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures.\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued Update No. 2017-09 (ASU 2017-09) Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718). The purpose of this update is to provide clarity as to which modifications of awards require modification accounting under Topic 718, whereas previously issued guidance frequently resulted in varying interpretations and a diversity of practice. An entity should employ modification accounting unless the following are met: (1) the fair value of the award is the same immediately before and after the award is modified; (2) the vesting conditions are the same under both the modified award and the original award; and (3) the classification of the modified award is the same as the original award, either equity or liability. Regardless of whether modification accounting is utilized, award disclosure requirements under Topic 718 remain unchanged. This guidance will be effective for annual or any interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We adopted the new standard on the effective date of January 1, 2018 and do not believe adoption will have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures.\nThere are no other accounting standards applicable to the Company that would have a material effect on the Company's financial statements and disclosures that have been issued but not yet adopted by the Company as of December 31, 2017, and through the filing date of this report.\nEffects of Inflation and Pricing\nInflation in the United States decreased to1.8% in 2017 from 2.2% in 2016 and from 2.0% in 2015, which did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the periods ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Although the impact of inflation has been relatively insignificant in recent years, it is still a factor in the United States economy and we tend to experience inflationary pressure on the cost of oilfield services and equipment as increasing oil and gas prices increase drilling activity in our areas of operations. Material changes in prices also impact the current revenue stream, estimates of future reserves, borrowing base calculations, depletion expense, impairment assessments of oil and gas properties, ARO, and values of properties in purchase and sale transactions. Material changes in prices can impact the value of oil and gas companies and their ability to raise capital, borrow money and retain personnel.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nCurrently, we do not

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nExecutive Summary\nWe are a Denver-based exploration and production company focused on the extraction of oil and associated liquids-rich natural gas in the United States. Our oil and liquids-weighted assets are concentrated primarily in the Wattenberg Field in Colorado and the Dorcheat Macedonia Field in southern Arkansas.\nBankruptcy Proceedings under Chapter 11\nOn January 4, 2017, the Debtors filed voluntary petitions under Chapter 11 in the Bankruptcy Court. The Debtors received bankruptcy court confirmation of their Plan on April 7, 2017, and emerged from bankruptcy on April 28, 2017, the Effective Date. For additional information about our bankruptcy proceedings and emergence, see Note 2 - Chapter 11 Proceedings and Emergence.\nUpon emergence from bankruptcy, the Company adopted fresh-start accounting and became a new entity for financial reporting purposes. Upon adoption of fresh-start accounting, our assets and liabilities were recorded at their fair values as of the Effective Date, which differed materially from the recorded values of those same assets and liabilities in the Predecessor Company. As a result, our balance sheets and statement of operations subsequent to the Effective Date are not comparable to our balance sheets and statements of operations prior to the Effective Date. For additional information about our application of fresh-start accounting, see Note 3 - Fresh-Start Accounting.\nEmployment Modifications\nOn June 5, 2017, our board of directors approved and the Company adopted the Fourth Amended and Restated Executive Change in Control and Severance Benefit Plan (the Severance Plan\u201d). The Severance Plan entitles certain executives and key employees to specific severance benefits and accelerated vesting of stock awards upon a qualifying termination from the Company. These benefits are subject to certain limitations including a reduction of the cash severance payment by the intrinsic value of the individual's unvested Management Incentive Plan awards (granted on the Effective Date) on a dollar-for-dollar basis.\nOn June 11, 2017, Richard J. Carty resigned as a member of the board of directors and left his role as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Mr. Carty received accelerated vesting of the equity awards he was granted on the Effective Date, which awards were in accordance with the Plan and approved by the prior board of directors. The accelerated awards consisted of 137,814 non-qualified stock options with a $34.36 strike price, which were forfeited as they had to be exercised within 90 days of the termination effective date, and 137,814 restricted stock units. The grant-date fair value of the options and restricted stock units was $17.42 and $34.36, respectively, resulting in a one-time non-cash stock-based compensation charge of $7.1 million. The exercisable value of the equity grants on the effective date of termination was $4.3 million. There was no cash severance provided in accordance with the terms of the Severance Plan.\nDuring 2017, the Company implemented a series of cost reductions that included a reduction in workforce and operating expenses. These reductions resulted in one-time cash severance charges of approximately $1.6 million and anticipated operating expense implementation fees of approximately $2.0 million to $3.0 million to be incurred in 2018. The anticipated annualized impact of this action is a reduction in recurring cash general and administrative expense of approximately $10.0 million and operating expenses of $10.0 million. The operating cost reductions will be implemented throughout the coming year and are anticipated to be fully realized by the beginning of 2019. The Company continues to review its costs to better align its cost structure with the current commodity price environment.\nThe Company is actively pursuing the permanent placement of leadership to carryout the planned growth and development plans of the Company.\nFinancial and Operating Results\nOur 2017 financial and operational results include:\n \u2022 Total liquidity of $204.4 million at December 31, 2017, consisting of, year-end cash balance plus funds available under the successor credit facility, as compared with $38.9 million, consisting of, the year-end cash balance net of the borrowing base deficiency under the predecessor credit facility at December 31, 2016. Please refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources below for additional discussion; \n \u2022 Increased proved reserves by 13% to 102.0 MMBoe as of December 31, 2017, from 90.7 MMBoe as of December 31, 2016; \n \u2022 Decreased the go-forward annualized general and administrative and operating expenses by $20.0 million; \n \u2022 Full year capital expenditures were $109.8 million; \n \u2022 Entered into two new gas gathering and processing contracts in the Wattenberg Field allowing greater reliability, optionality and enhancement of our RMI system. \nBusiness Strategies and Outlook for 2018\nIn 2018, the Company plans to accelerate development while testing enhanced completion designs on large-scale pads throughout the Company's acreage position, including delineating its French Lake leasehold. The program contemplates running one rig in the first half of 2018 with a second rig added at mid-year to coincide with additional gas processing capacity. The 2018 program is expected to grow Wattenberg annual production by approximately 20% in 2018 and greater than 50% in 2019, assuming a continuous two rig program. Allocated capital associated with this program is expected to be approximately $280.0 million to $320.0 million, which will support drilling 90 gross wells and turning online 55 gross wells in 2018.\nIn order to focus and partially fund its core asset development, the Company elected, subsequent to year-end, to actively pursue divesting of its Mid-Continent region and North Park Basin. The Company successfully sold its North Park Basin on March 9, 2018 for $0.1 million and full release of all current and future obligations.\nIn order to help achieve the Company's strategies, we are actively seeking to secure permanent leadership.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Comparative results of operations for the period indicated are discussed below.\nThe table below presents revenues, sales volumes, and average sales prices for the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentages):\n\n_____________________________\n (1) Crude oil sales excludes $0.2 million, $0.1 million and $0.5 million of oil transportation revenues from third parties, which do not have associated sales volumes, for the Current Successor Period, Current Predecessor Period and the Prior Predecessor Period, respectively. \n (2) Natural gas sales excludes $0.8 million, $0.4 million and $1.5 million of gas gathering revenues from third parties, which do not have associated sales volumes, for the Current Successor Period, Current Predecessor Period and the Prior Predecessor Period, respectively. \n (3) Determined using the ratio of 6 Mcf of natural gas to 1 Bbl of crude oil. \n (4) The derivatives economically hedge the price we receive for crude oil. For the Current Successor Period, the derivative cash settlement loss was $1.5 million and the derivative cash settlement gain was $18.3 million for the Prior Predecessor Period. Please refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 13 - Derivatives for additional disclosures.  Operating revenues decreased by 1% to $190.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $193.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 largely due to a 26% decrease in sales volumes offset by a 34% increase in oil equivalent pricing. The decreased volumes are a direct result of the Company suspending drilling and completion activities through the majority of 2016 and the first half of 2017. During the period from December 31, 2016 through December 31, 2017, we completed 10.0 net operated wells in the Rocky Mountain region and no wells in the Mid-Continent region.\nThe following table summarizes our operating expenses for the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nLease operating expense. Our lease operating expense decreased $4.7 million or 11%, to $39.0 million for the Current Successor and Predecessor Periods from $43.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 but increased on an equivalent basis from $5.50 per Boe to $6.68 per Boe due to reduced production. The Company eliminated significant amounts of compression and labor costs resulting in a decrease in total compression costs of $4.1 million for the Current Successor and Predecessor Period when compared to the same period in 2016.\nGas plant and midstream operating expense. Our gas plant and midstream operating expense decreased $0.9 million to $11.9 million for the Current Successor and Predecessor Period from $12.8 million for the Prior Predecessor Period but increased on an equivalent basis from $1.62 per Boe to $2.04 per Boe due to reduced production. Gas plant and midstream operating expense on an aggregate basis is commensurate between the comparable periods.\nSeverance and ad valorem taxes. Our severance and ad valorem taxes remained constant between the Current Successor and Predecessor Period and the Prior Predecessor Period. Severance and ad valorem taxes primarily correlate to revenue. Revenues decreased by 1% for the Current Successor and Predecessor Period when compared to the same period in 2016.\nExploration. Our exploration expense increased $6.5 million to $7.4 million for the Current Successor and Predecessor Period from $0.9 million for the comparable period in 2016. During the Current Successor and Predecessor Period we paid $3.8 million in delay rentals, incurred $2.9 million on abandoned well projects and $0.7 million in geological and geophysical expenses. During the Prior Predecessor Period, we incurred $0.9 million on abandoned well projects.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization. Our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense per Boe was $5.66, $13.54 and $14.01 for the Current Successor Period, Current Predecessor Period and Prior Predecessor Period. The Current Successor Period reflects the $310.6 million fair value downward adjustment to the depletable asset base upon adoption of fresh-start accounting.\nImpairment of oil and gas properties. There were no impairment of oil and gas properties during the Current Successor and Predecessor Periods. During the Prior Predecessor Period, we incurred a $10.0 million impairment charge on our Mid-Continent assets based on the most recent bid received during the first quarter of 2016, when they were held for sale. Please refer to Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion on our impairment policy and practice.\nAbandonment and impairment of unproved properties. There were no abandonment and impairment of unproved properties during the Current Successor and Predecessor Periods. During the Prior Predecessor Period, we incurred an abandonment and impairment of unproved properties charge of $24.7 million due to non-core leases expiring within the Wattenberg Field.\nUnused commitments. There were no unused commitments during the Current Successor Period. During the Current Predecessor Period, we incurred $1.0 million in unused commitment fees on a water supply contract in the Wattenberg Field. During the Prior Predecessor Period, we incurred unused commitment fees of $7.7 million, made up of $4.3 million water commitment deficiency payments and $3.4 million purchase and transportation deficiency payments. Please see Note 8 - Commitments and Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion.\nContract settlement expense. There were no contract settlement expenses during the Current Successor and Predecessor Periods. During the Prior Predecessor Period, we incurred a $21.0 million loss to settle our crude oil purchase agreement with Silo as part of our bankruptcy process. Please see Note 8 - Commitments and Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion.\nGeneral and administrative expense. Our general and administrative expense per Boe was $11.34, $7.28 and $9.71 for the Current Successor Period, Current Predecessor Period and Prior Predecessor Period. The Current Successor Period reflects a one-time cash and non-cash $9.6 million or $2.55 per Boe severance charge primarily related to the Company's former Chief Executive Officer's separation from the Company. The Prior Predecessor Period includes $13.3 million or $1.68 per Boe more of advisor fees than the comparable period in 2017. Excluding those two items the per Boe metrics are commensurate between the periods presented.\nDerivative gain (loss). Our derivative loss for the Current Successor Period was $15.4 million. We had no derivative contracts during the Current Predecessor Period. During the Current Successor Period, we entered into several oil and gas costless collar and swap contracts. Our derivative loss is mainly due to fair market value adjustments caused by market prices being higher than our contracted hedge prices. Our derivative loss for the Prior Predecessor Period was $11.2 million. Due to the Company being in default on the predecessor credit facility, all of these derivative contracts in the Prior Predecessor Period were terminated during the fourth quarter of 2016. Please see Note 13 - Derivatives in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion.\nInterest expense. Our interest expense for the Current Successor Period, Current Predecessor Period and Prior Predecessor Period was $0.8 million, $5.7 million and $62.1 million. Upon filing its petition for Chapter 11, the Company ceased accruing interest expense on its Senior Notes. The Company incurred $0.7 million in commitment fees on the available borrowing base under the successor credit facility during the Current Successor Period. Interest expense on the Senior Notes was $1.0 million and $52.3 million for the Current Predecessor Period and Prior Predecessor Period, respectively, with the remaining interest expense relating to the predecessor credit facility. The Company had no outstanding debt during the Current Successor Period. Average debt outstanding for the Current Predecessor Period and Prior Predecessor Period was $991.7 million and $1.0 billion, respectively.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nThe table below presents predecessor revenues, sales volumes, and average sales prices for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\n\n________________________________\n (1) Crude oil sales excludes $0.5 million and $0.2 million of oil transportation revenues from third parties, which do not have associated sales volumes, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \n (2) Natural gas sales excludes $1.5 million and $0.8 million of gas gathering revenues from third parties, which do not have associated sales volumes, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \n (3) Determined using the ratio of 6 Mcf of natural gas to 1 Bbl of crude oil. \n (4) The derivatives economically hedge the price we receive for crude oil and natural gas. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the derivative cash settlement gain for oil contracts was $18.3 million and $128.3 million, respectively, and the derivative cash settlement gain for gas contracts was $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Please refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 13 - Derivatives for additional disclosures. \nRevenues decreased by 34% to $193.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $292.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 largely due to a 23% decrease in sales volumes coupled with a 14% decrease in oil equivalent pricing. The decreased volumes are a direct result of the Company suspending all drilling and completion activities after the first quarter of 2016. During the period from December 31, 2015 through December 31, 2016, we completed 21 gross wells in the Rocky Mountain region and drilled and completed no wells in the Mid-Continent region.\nThe following table summarizes our operating expenses for the predecessor periods indicated:\n\nLease operating expense. Our lease operating expense decreased $21.4 million or 33%, to $43.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $65.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and decreased on an equivalent basis from $6.30 per Boe to $5.50 per Boe. The majority of the decrease is due to continued operating cost reductions along with decreased activity levels. The Company reduced operating costs and negotiated contract reductions resulting in decreased well servicing costs of $10.1 million, compression costs of $4.9 million and pumping and gauging costs of $2.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015.\nGas plant and midstream operating expense. Our gas plant and midstream operating expense increased $1.5 million to $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and increased on an equivalent basis from $1.10 per Boe to $1.62 per Boe. The increase in aggregate and on an equivalent basis is due to the start-up and continued buildout of RMI, which began in May of 2015.\nSeverance and ad valorem taxes. Our severance and ad valorem taxes decreased by 18%, or $3.3 million to $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Severance and ad valorem taxes primarily correlate to revenue. Revenues decreased by 33% for the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, which was offset by a tax refund received during the third quarter of 2015.\nExploration. Our exploration expense decreased $14.9 million to $0.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 from $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred minimal exploration charges. During the year ended December 31, 2015 we incurred charges of $5.6 million and $8.5 million for exploratory wells located in the North Park Basin and outside of our current development area in southern Arkansas, respectively, which we were unable to assign economic proved reserves. During 2015, we also paid $1.0 million and $0.7 million in geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals, respectively.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization. Our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense decreased $133.7 million, or 55%, to $111.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $244.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and decreased on an equivalent basis from $23.73 per Boe to $14.01 per Boe. The Company realized significant proved property impairments during the fourth quarter of 2015 resulting in a 50% decrease in the net proved property depletable base from the year ended December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016.\nImpairment of oil and gas properties. For the year ended December 31, 2016 we incurred an impairment of proved properties of $10.0 million, a $730.5 million decrease from the year ended December 31, 2015. We impaired our Mid-Continent assets by $10.0 million based on the most recent bid received during the first quarter of 2016, when it was held for sale. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we impaired our Mid-Continent assets by $321.2 million due to their depressed fair value upon classification as held for sale and our Rocky Mountain assets by $419.3 million due to low commodity prices. Please refer to Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion on our impairment policy and practice.\nAbandonment and impairment of unproved properties. For the year ended December 31, 2016 we incurred an abandonment and impairment of unproved properties of $24.7 million, an $8.9 million decrease from the prior year. Our 2016 abandonment and impairment charges related to non-core leases expiring within the Wattenberg Field. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $24.8 million of impairment charges relating to non-core leases expiring within the Wattenberg Field and $8.7 million of impairment charges to fully impair the North Park Basin due to a strategic shift in our development plan.\nUnused commitments. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $7.7 million in unused commitment fees. During 2015, we did not incur any fees of this nature. The unused commitment fees in 2016 of $4.3 million and $3.4 million are the result of water commitment deficiency payments and purchase and transportation agreement deficiency payments, respectively. Please see Note 8 - Commitments and Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion.\nContract settlement expense. For the year ended December 31, 2016 we incurred a $21.0 million loss to settle our crude oil purchase agreement with Silo as part of our bankruptcy process. There were no material settlements during 2015. Please see Note 8 - Commitments and Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion.\nGeneral and administrative expense. Our general and administrative expense increased $6.7 million, or 10%, to $77.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $70.3 million for the comparable period in 2015 and increased on an equivalent basis to $9.71 per Boe from $6.81 per Boe. The increase in general and administrative expense in 2016 on an aggregate and equivalent basis is due to $20.4 million of advisory fees related to our restructuring efforts and an increase of $1.2 million in severance payments. These cost increases were offset by a decrease in salaries and wages, including benefits of $9.3 million and stock compensation of $5.7 million due to reductions in workforce that have occurred since December 31, 2015.\nDerivative gain (loss). Our derivative loss increased $67.8 million to an $11.2 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 from a gain of $56.6 million for the comparable period in 2015. The decrease is related to a reduction of hedged volumes throughout 2016 and decreased contract prices at the time of conversion from three-way collars to swap and puts at the end of the first quarter of 2016 bringing them closer to realized prices during the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015. Please refer to Note 13 - Derivatives in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion.\nInterest expense. Our interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased 9% to $62.1 million compared to $57.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The interest expense increase is a result of increased average debt outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $1.0 billion, compared to $847.9 million for the comparable period in 2015. Total interest expense is comprised primarily of interest expense attributable to the Senior Notes including amortization\nof the premium and financing costs, which was $52.3 million and $52.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nIncome tax benefit (expense). Our estimate for federal and state income tax benefit for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was zero and $164.9 million, respectively. We are allowed to deduct various items for tax reporting purposes that are capitalized for purposes of financial statement presentation. Our effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was 0.0% and 18.1%, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, a full valuation was placed against the net deferred tax assets, which caused effective tax rate to differ from the U.S. statutory income tax rate.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe successor Company's anticipated sources of liquidity include cash from operating activities, borrowings under the successor credit facility, proceeds from sales of assets and potential proceeds from capital market transactions. Our cash flows from operating activities are subject to significant volatility due to changes in commodity prices for our crude oil, NGL and natural gas products, as well as variations in our production. The prices for these commodities are driven by a number of factors beyond our control, including global and regional product supply and demand, weather, product distribution, refining and processing capacity and other supply chain dynamics, among other factors.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our liquidity was $204.4 million, consisting of cash on hand of $12.7 million and $191.7 million of available borrowing capacity on the successor credit facility. As of the date of filing, we had $15.0 million outstanding on our successor credit facility.\nOn April 7, 2017, the Company's Plan was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, and the Plan became effective on April 28, 2017. Upon emergence from bankruptcy, we (i) executed the successor credit facility with an initial borrowing base of $191.7 million and maturity date of March 31, 2021 and (ii) issued new common stock as part of the $200.0 million rights offering and the $7.5 million transaction with the ad hoc equity committee. Please refer to Note 2 - Chapter 11 Proceedings and Emergence for additional details.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows and other financial measures for the periods indicated (in thousands).\n\nCash flows provided by operating activities\nThe Current Successor Period included cash receipts and disbursements attributable to our normal operating cycle. The Current Predecessor Period contained the reorganization costs along with our normal operating receipts and disbursements. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities between the year ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 resulted primarily from a 13% decrease in crude oil equivalent pricing and a 23% decrease in sales volumes and a $112.7 million decrease in derivative cash settlements. See Results of Operations above for more information on the factors driving these changes.\nCash flows used in investing activities\nExpenditures for development of oil and natural gas properties are the primary use of our capital resources. The Company spent $81.8 million, $5.6 million, $52.4 million and $442.2 million for Current Successor Period, Current\nPredecessor Period, Prior Predecessor Periods for 2016 and 2015. The fluctuation in cash flows in investing activities is a direct result of the Company's entrance and emergence from bankruptcy.\nCash flows provided by financing activities\nNet cash used by financing activities for the Current Successor Period consisted of employee tax withholdings in exchanges for the return of common stock. Net cash provided by financing activities for the Current Predecessor Period consisted of proceeds from the rights offering of $207.5 million net of the $191.7 million repayment to the predecessor credit facility. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted primarily of net proceeds from the predecessor credit facility of $112.7 million. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of $202.7 million of net proceeds from the sale of common stock plus net borrowings of $46.0 million from our predecessor credit facility.\nCredit facility\nSuccessor Credit Facility\nThe administrative agent of our $191.7 million successor credit facility is KeyBank National Association. The successor credit facility provides for interest rates plus an applicable margin to be determined based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) or a base rate ( Base Rate\u201d), at the Company's election. LIBOR borrowings bear interest at LIBOR plus 3.00% to 4.00% depending on the utilization level, and the Base Rate borrowings bear interest at the Reference Rate,\u201d as defined in the successor credit facility, plus 2.00% to 3.00%.\nOur approved borrowing base under the successor credit facility, which was $191.7 million as of December 31, 2017, is redetermined semiannually as early as April and October of each year and up to one additional time between such scheduled determinations upon our request or upon the request of the required lenders (defined as lenders holding 662/3% of the aggregate commitments). The borrowing base is determined by the value of our oil and gas reserves but also takes into consideration such information as a repayment analysis of the Company's debt and the forecasted financial condition of the Company. The borrowing base is redetermined (i) in the sole discretion of the administrative agent and all of the lenders, (ii) in accordance with their customary internal standards and practices for valuing and redetermining the value of oil and gas properties in connection with reserve based oil and natural gas loan transactions, (iii) in conjunction with the most recent engineering report and other information received by the administrative agent and the lenders relating to our proved reserves and (iv) based upon the estimated value of our proved reserves as determined by the administrative agent and the lenders.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had nothing outstanding under the successor credit facility and had the ability to borrow up to the borrowing base of $191.7 million.\nOur obligations under the successor credit facility are secured by first priority liens on all of our property and assets (whether real, personal, or mixed, tangible or intangible), including our proved reserves and our oil and gas properties (which term is defined to include fee mineral interests, term mineral interests, leases, subleases, farm-outs, royalties, overriding royalties, net profit interests, carried interests, production payments, back in interests and reversionary interests). The successor credit facility is guaranteed by the Company and all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries.\nThe applicable margin varies on a daily basis based on the percentage outstanding under the borrowing base. We incur quarterly commitment fees based on the unused amount of the borrowing base of 0.50% per annum. We may prepay loans under the successor credit facility at any time without premium or penalty (other than customary LIBOR breakage costs).\nThe successor credit facility contains various covenants limiting our ability to:\n \u2022 grant or assume liens; \n \u2022 incur or assume indebtedness; \n \u2022 grant negative pledges or agree to restrict dividends or distributions from subsidiaries; \n \u2022 sell, transfer, assign or convey assets, or engage in certain mergers or acquisitions; \n \u2022 make certain distributions; \n \u2022 make certain loans, advances and investments; \n \u2022 materially change the character of our business as an oil and gas exploration and production company \n \u2022 engage in transactions with affiliates; \n \u2022 purchase or carry any margin stock; \n \u2022 enter into sale and leaseback, take-or-pay or hydrocarbon prepayment transactions; or \n \u2022 enter into certain swap agreements. \nThe successor credit facility also contains covenants requiring us to maintain:\n \u2022 a leverage ratio (i.e., the ratio of consolidated indebtedness, excluding indebtedness under surety bonds, performance bonds or hedge contracts, to earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion, and amortization, exploration expense and other non-cash charges ( EBITDAX\u201d)) not to exceed 3.50 to 1.00. \n \u2022 an interest coverage ratio (i.e., the ratio of the trailing twelve-month EBITDAX to trailing twelve-month interest expense) of not less than 2.50 to 1.00. \n \u2022 a current ratio (i.e., the ratio of current assets to current liabilities, excluding unsettled derivatives and the current portion of long-term debt) of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 (current assets include, as of the date of calculation, the aggregate of all lenders' unused commitment amounts); \nThe successor credit facility contains customary events of default, including:\n \u2022 failure to pay any principal, interest, fees, expenses or other amounts when due; \n \u2022 the failure of any representation or warranty to be materially true and correct when made; \n \u2022 failure to observe any agreement, obligation or covenant in the credit agreement, subject to cure periods for certain failures; \n \u2022 a cross-default for the payment of any other indebtedness of at least $5 million; \n \u2022 bankruptcy or insolvency; \n \u2022 judgments against us or our subsidiaries, in excess of $5 million, that are not stayed; \n \u2022 certain ERISA events involving us or our subsidiaries; and \n \u2022 a change in control (as defined in the successor credit facility), including the ownership by a person\u201d or group\u201d (as defined under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, but excluding certain permitted stockholders) directly or indirectly, of more than 35% of our common stock, other than certain of our current stockholders. \nAs of December 31, 2017, and through the filing date of this report, the Company is in compliance with all of the successor credit facility covenants.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have the following contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2017:\n\n___________________\n (1) The Company has one purchase and transportation agreement and one operating lease. Please refer to Note 8 - Commitments and Contingencies for additional discussion on these agreements and for a description of our operating lease. \n (2) Amounts represent our estimated future retirement obligations on an undiscounted basis. The discounted obligations are recorded as liabilities on our accompanying balance sheets as of December 31, 2017. Because these costs typically extend many years into the future, management prepares estimates and makes judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors. Please see Note 11 - Asset Retirement Obligation, for additional discussion. \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We provide expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies, estimates and judgments below. We believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates made by management.\nMethod of accounting for oil and natural gas properties\nOil and natural gas exploration and development activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Under this method, all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized at cost when incurred, pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves. If an exploratory well does not find proved reserves, the costs of drilling the well are charged to expense. The costs of development wells are capitalized whether productive or nonproductive. All capitalized well costs and other associated costs and leasehold costs of proved properties are amortized on a unit-of-production basis over the remaining life of proved developed reserves and proved reserves, respectively.\nCosts of retired, sold or abandoned properties that constitute a part of an amortization base (partial field) are charged or credited, net of proceeds, to accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization unless doing so significantly affects the unit-of-production amortization rate for an entire field, in which case a gain or loss is recognized currently. Gains or losses from the disposal of properties are recognized currently.\nExpenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals necessary to maintain properties in operating condition are expensed as incurred. Major betterments, replacements and renewals are capitalized to the appropriate property and equipment accounts. Estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs for oil and natural gas properties are capitalized, net of salvage, at their estimated net present value and amortized on a unit-of-production basis over the remaining life of the related proved developed reserves.\nUnproved properties consist of costs incurred to acquire unproved leases, or lease acquisition costs. Unproved lease acquisition costs are capitalized until the leases expire or when we specifically identify leases that will revert to the lessor, at\nwhich time we expense the associated unproved lease acquisition costs. The expensing or expiration of unproved lease acquisition costs are recorded as abandonment or impairment of unproved properties in the statements of operations and comprehensive income in our consolidated financial statements. Lease acquisition costs related to successful exploratory drilling are reclassified to proved properties and depleted on a unit-of-production basis.\nFor sales of entire working interests in unproved properties, gain or loss is recognized to the extent of the difference between the proceeds received and the net carrying value of the property. Proceeds from sales of partial interests in unproved properties are accounted for as a recovery of costs unless the proceeds exceed the entire cost of the property.\nOil and natural gas reserve quantities and Standardized Measure\nIn the current year, our third-party petroleum consultant prepared our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and associated future net revenues. In the two years prior, our internal corporate reservoir engineering group prepared, and our third-party petroleum consultant audited our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and associated future net revenues. While the SEC has adopted rules which allow us to disclose proved, probable and possible reserves, we have elected to disclose only proved reserves in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The SEC's revised rules define proved reserves as the quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. Our internal corporate reservoir engineering group and our third party petroleum consultant must make a number of subjective assumptions based on their professional judgment in developing reserve estimates. Reserve estimates are updated annually and consider recent production levels and other technical information about each field. Oil and natural gas reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be precisely measured. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment.\nPeriodic revisions to the estimated reserves and future cash flows may be necessary as a result of a number of factors, including reservoir performance, oil and natural gas prices, cost changes, technological advances, new geological or geophysical data, or other economic factors. Accordingly, reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. We cannot predict the amounts or timing of future reserve revisions. If such revisions are significant, they could significantly affect future amortization of capitalized costs and result in impairment of assets that may be material.\nRevenue recognition\nRevenue from our interests in producing wells is recognized when the product is delivered, at which time the customer has taken title and assumed the risks and rewards of ownership, and collectability is reasonably assured. The sales prices for oil and natural gas are adjusted for transportation and other related deductions. These deductions are based on contractual or historical data and do not require significant judgment.\nSubsequently, these revenue deductions are adjusted to reflect actual charges based on third-party documents. Since there is a ready market for oil and natural gas, we sell the majority of production soon after it is produced at various locations.\nImpairment of proved properties\nWe review our proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value may have occurred and at least annually. We estimate the expected undiscounted future cash flows of our oil and natural gas properties and compare such undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the oil and natural gas properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, we will adjust the carrying amount of the oil and natural gas properties to fair value. The factors used to determine fair value are subject to our judgment and expertise and include, but are not limited to, recent sales prices of comparable properties, the present value of future cash flows, net of estimated operating and development costs using estimates of proved reserves, future commodity pricing, future production estimates, anticipated capital expenditures, and various discount rates commensurate with the risk and current market conditions associated with realizing the expected cash flows projected. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these factors, we cannot predict when or if future impairment charges for proved properties will be recorded.\nImpairment of unproved properties\nWe assess our unproved properties periodically for impairment on a property-by-property basis based on remaining lease terms, drilling results or future plans to develop acreage and record abandonment and impairment expense for any decline in value.\nWe have historically recognized abandonment and impairment expense for unproved properties at the time when the lease term has expired or sooner if, in management's judgment, the unproved properties have lost some or all of their carrying value. We consider the following factors in our assessment of the impairment of unproved properties:\n \u2022 the remaining amount of unexpired term under our leases; \n \u2022 our ability to actively manage and prioritize our capital expenditures to drill leases and to make payments to extend leases that may be closer to expiration; \n \u2022 our ability to exchange lease positions with other companies that allow for higher concentrations of ownership and development; \n \u2022 our ability to convey partial mineral ownership to other companies in exchange for their drilling of leases; and \n \u2022 our evaluation of the continuing successful results from the application of completion technology in the Wattenberg Field by us or by other operators in areas adjacent to or near our unproved properties. \nThe assessment of unproved properties to determine any possible impairment requires significant judgment.\nAsset retirement obligations\nWe record the fair value of a liability for a legal obligation to retire an asset in the period in which the liability is incurred with the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. For oil and gas properties, this is the period in which the well is drilled or acquired. The asset retirement obligation ( ARO\u201d) for oil and gas properties represents the estimated amount we will incur to plug, abandon and remediate the properties at the end of their productive lives, in accordance with applicable state laws. The liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated on the unit-of-production method. The accretion expense is recorded as a component of depreciation, depletion and amortization in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nWe determine the ARO by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows related to the liability. Estimating the future ARO requires management to make estimates and judgments regarding timing, existence of a liability, as well as what constitutes adequate restoration. Inherent in the fair value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate costs, inflation factors, credit-adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the fair value of the existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the related asset.\nDerivatives\nWe record all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at their estimated fair value. We have not designated any derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes and we do not enter into such instruments for speculative trading purposes. Derivative instruments are adjusted to fair value every accounting period. Derivative cash settlements and gains and losses from valuation changes in the remaining unsettled commodity derivative instruments are reported under derivative gain (loss) in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nStock-based compensation\nRestricted Stock Units. We recognize compensation expense for all restricted stock units made to employees and directors. Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. The fair value of restricted stock grants is based on the value of our common stock on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation expense recorded for restricted stock units is included in general and administrative expenses on our accompanying statements of operations.\nStock Options. We recognize compensation expense for all stock option awards made to employees. Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. The fair value of stock option grants is based on a Black-Scholes Model. Stock-based compensation expense recorded for stock option awards is included in general and administrative expenses on our accompanying statements of operations.\nIncome taxes\nOur provision for taxes includes both federal and state taxes. We record our federal income taxes in accordance with accounting for income taxes under GAAP which results in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance would be established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized.\nWe apply significant judgment in evaluating our tax positions and estimating our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The actual outcome of these future tax consequences could differ significantly from our estimates, which could impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe also account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nExecutive Summary\nWe are a Denver-based exploration and production company focused on the extraction of oil and associated liquids-rich natural gas in the United States. Our oil and liquids-weighted assets are concentrated primarily in the Wattenberg Field in Colorado and the Dorcheat Macedonia Field in southern Arkansas.\nBankruptcy Proceedings under Chapter 11\nOn January 4, 2017, the Debtors filed voluntary petitions under Chapter 11 in the Bankruptcy Court. The Debtors received bankruptcy court confirmation of their Plan on April 7, 2017, and emerged from bankruptcy on April 28, 2017, the Effective Date. For additional information about our bankruptcy proceedings and emergence, see Note 2 - Chapter 11 Proceedings and Emergence.\nUpon emergence from bankruptcy, the Company adopted fresh-start accounting and became a new entity for financial reporting purposes. Upon adoption of fresh-start accounting, our assets and liabilities were recorded at their fair values as of the Effective Date, which differed materially from the recorded values of those same assets and liabilities in the Predecessor Company. As a result, our balance sheets and statement of operations subsequent to the Effective Date are not comparable to our balance sheets and statements of operations prior to the Effective Date. For additional information about our application of fresh-start accounting, see Note 3 - Fresh-Start Accounting.\nEmployment Modifications\nOn June 5, 2017, our board of directors approved and the Company adopted the Fourth Amended and Restated Executive Change in Control and Severance Benefit Plan (the Severance Plan\u201d). The Severance Plan entitles certain executives and key employees to specific severance benefits and accelerated vesting of stock awards upon a qualifying termination from the Company. These benefits are subject to certain limitations including a reduction of the cash severance payment by the intrinsic value of the individual's unvested Management Incentive Plan awards (granted on the Effective Date) on a dollar-for-dollar basis.\nOn June 11, 2017, Richard J. Carty resigned as a member of the board of directors and left his role as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Mr. Carty received accelerated vesting of the equity awards he was granted on the Effective Date, which awards were in accordance with the Plan and approved by the prior board of directors. The accelerated awards consisted of 137,814 non-qualified stock options with a $34.36 strike price, which were forfeited as they had to be exercised within 90 days of the termination effective date, and 137,814 restricted stock units. The grant-date fair value of the options and restricted stock units was $17.42 and $34.36, respectively, resulting in a one-time non-cash stock-based compensation charge of $7.1 million. The exercisable value of the equity grants on the effective date of termination was $4.3 million. There was no cash severance provided in accordance with the terms of the Severance Plan.\nDuring 2017, the Company implemented a series of cost reductions that included a reduction in workforce and operating expenses. These reductions resulted in one-time cash severance charges of approximately $1.6 million and anticipated operating expense implementation fees of approximately $2.0 million to $3.0 million to be incurred in 2018. The anticipated annualized impact of this action is a reduction in recurring cash general and administrative expense of approximately $10.0 million and operating expenses of $10.0 million. The operating cost reductions will be implemented throughout the coming year and are anticipated to be fully realized by the beginning of 2019. The Company continues to review its costs to better align its cost structure with the current commodity price environment.\nThe Company is actively pursuing the permanent placement of leadership to carryout the planned growth and development plans of the Company.\nFinancial and Operating Results\nOur 2017 financial and operational results include:\n \u2022 Total liquidity of $204.4 million at December 31, 2017, consisting of, year-end cash balance plus funds available under the successor credit facility, as compared with $38.9 million, consisting of, the year-end cash balance net of the borrowing base deficiency under the predecessor credit facility at December 31, 2016. Please refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources below for additional discussion; \n \u2022 Increased proved reserves by 13% to 102.0 MMBoe as of December 31, 2017, from 90.7 MMBoe as of December 31, 2016; \n \u2022 Decreased the go-forward annualized general and administrative and operating expenses by $20.0 million; \n \u2022 Full year capital expenditures were $109.8 million; \n \u2022 Entered into two new gas gathering and processing contracts in the Wattenberg Field allowing greater reliability, optionality and enhancement of our RMI system. \nBusiness Strategies and Outlook for 2018\nIn 2018, the Company plans to accelerate development while testing enhanced completion designs on large-scale pads throughout the Company's acreage position, including delineating its French Lake leasehold. The program contemplates running one rig in the first half of 2018 with a second rig added at mid-year to coincide with additional gas processing capacity. The 2018 program is expected to grow Wattenberg annual production by approximately 20% in 2018 and greater than 50% in 2019, assuming a continuous two rig program. Allocated capital associated with this program is expected to be approximately $280.0 million to $320.0 million, which will support drilling 90 gross wells and turning online 55 gross wells in 2018.\nIn order to focus and partially fund its core asset development, the Company elected, subsequent to year-end, to actively pursue divesting of its Mid-Continent region and North Park Basin. The Company successfully sold its North Park Basin on March 9, 2018 for $0.1 million and full release of all current and future obligations.\nIn order to help achieve the Company's strategies, we are actively seeking to secure permanent leadership.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

$0.1 million and $0.5 million of oil transportation revenues from third parties, which do not have associated sales volumes, for the Current Successor Period, Current Predecessor Period and the Prior Predecessor Period, respectively. \n (2) Natural gas sales excludes $0.8 million, $0.4 million and $1.5 million of gas gathering revenues from third parties, which do not have associated sales volumes, for the Current Successor Period, Current Predecessor Period and the Prior Predecessor Period, respectively. \n (3) Determined using the ratio of 6 Mcf of natural gas to 1 Bbl of crude oil. \n (4) The derivatives economically hedge the price we receive for crude oil. For the Current Successor Period, the derivative cash settlement loss was $1.5 million and the derivative cash settlement gain was $18.3 million for the Prior Predecessor Period. Please refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 13 - Derivatives for additional disclosures.  Operating revenues decreased by 1% to $190.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $193.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 largely due to a 26% decrease in sales volumes offset by a 34% increase in oil equivalent pricing. The decreased volumes are a direct result of the Company suspending drilling and completion activities through the majority of 2016 and the first half of 2017. During the period from December 31, 2016 through December 31, 2017, we completed 10.0 net operated wells in the Rocky Mountain region and no wells in the Mid-Continent region.\nThe following table

Our lease operating expense decreased $4.7 million or 11%, to $39.0 million for the Current Successor and Predecessor Periods from $43.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 but increased on an equivalent basis from $5.50 per Boe to $6.68 per Boe due to reduced production. The Company eliminated significant amounts of compression and labor costs resulting in a decrease in total compression costs of $4.1 million for the Current Successor and Predecessor Period when compared to the same period in 2016.\nGas plant and midstream operating expense. Our gas plant and midstream operating expense decreased $0.9 million to $11.9 million for the Current Successor and Predecessor Period from $12.8 million for the Prior Predecessor Period but increased on an equivalent basis from $1.62 per Boe to $2.04 per Boe due to reduced production. Gas plant and midstream operating expense on an aggregate basis is commensurate between the comparable periods.\nSeverance and ad valorem taxes. Our severance and ad valorem taxes remained constant between the Current Successor and Predecessor Period and the Prior Predecessor Period. Severance and ad valorem taxes primarily correlate to revenue. Revenues decreased by 1% for the Current Successor and Predecessor Period when compared to the same period in 2016.\nExploration. Our exploration expense increased $6.5 million to $7.4 million for the Current Successor and Predecessor Period from $0.9 million for the comparable period in 2016. During the Current Successor and Predecessor Period we paid $3.8 million in delay rentals, incurred $2.9 million on abandoned well projects and $0.7 million in geological and geophysical expenses. During the Prior Predecessor Period, we incurred $0.9 million on abandoned well projects.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization. Our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense per Boe was $5.66, $13.54 and $14.01 for the Current Successor Period, Current Predecessor Period and Prior Predecessor Period. The Current Successor Period reflects the $310.6 million fair value downward adjustment to the depletable asset base upon adoption of fresh-start accounting.\nImpairment of oil and gas properties. There were no impairment of oil and gas properties during the Current Successor and Predecessor Periods. During the Prior Predecessor Period, we incurred a $10.0 million impairment charge on our Mid-Continent assets based on the most recent bid received during the first quarter of 2016, when they were held for sale. Please refer to Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion on our impairment policy and practice.\nAbandonment and impairment of unproved properties. There were no abandonment and impairment of unproved properties during the Current Successor and Predecessor Periods. During the Prior Predecessor Period, we incurred an abandonment and impairment of unproved properties charge of $24.7 million due to non-core leases expiring within the Wattenberg Field.\nUnused commitments. There were no unused commitments during the Current Successor Period. During the Current Predecessor Period, we incurred $1.0 million in unused commitment fees on a water supply contract in the Wattenberg Field. During the Prior Predecessor Period, we incurred unused commitment fees of $7.7 million, made up of $4.3 million water commitment deficiency payments and $3.4 million purchase and transportation deficiency payments. Please see Note 8 - Commitments and Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion.\nContract settlement expense. There were no contract settlement expenses during the Current Successor and Predecessor Periods. During the Prior Predecessor Period, we incurred a $21.0 million loss to settle our crude oil purchase agreement with Silo as part of our bankruptcy process. Please see Note 8 - Commitments and Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion.\nGeneral and administrative expense. Our general and administrative expense per Boe was $11.34, $7.28 and $9.71 for the Current Successor Period, Current Predecessor Period and Prior Predecessor Period. The Current Successor Period reflects a one-time cash and non-cash $9.6 million or $2.55 per Boe severance charge primarily related to the Company's former Chief Executive Officer's separation from the Company. The Prior Predecessor Period includes $13.3 million or $1.68 per Boe more of advisor fees than the comparable period in 2017. Excluding those two items the per Boe metrics are commensurate between the periods presented.\nDerivative gain (loss). Our derivative loss for the Current Successor Period was $15.4 million. We had no derivative contracts during the Current Predecessor Period. During the Current Successor Period, we entered into several oil and gas costless collar and swap contracts. Our derivative loss is mainly due to fair market value adjustments caused by market prices being higher than our contracted hedge prices. Our derivative loss for the Prior Predecessor Period was $11.2 million. Due to the Company being in default on the predecessor credit facility, all of these derivative contracts in the Prior Predecessor Period were terminated during the fourth quarter of 2016. Please see Note 13 - Derivatives in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion.\nInterest expense. Our interest expense for the Current Successor Period, Current Predecessor Period and Prior Predecessor Period was $0.8 million, $5.7 million and $62.1 million. Upon filing its petition for Chapter 11, the Company ceased accruing interest expense on its Senior Notes. The Company incurred $0.7 million in commitment fees on the available borrowing base under the successor credit facility during the Current Successor Period. Interest expense on the Senior Notes was $1.0 million and $52.3 million for the Current Predecessor Period and Prior Predecessor Period, respectively, with the remaining interest expense relating to the predecessor credit facility. The Company had no outstanding debt during the Current Successor Period. Average debt outstanding for the Current Predecessor Period and Prior Predecessor Period was $991.7 million and $1.0 billion, respectively.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended

For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the derivative cash settlement gain for oil contracts was $18.3 million and $128.3 million, respectively, and the derivative cash settlement gain for gas contracts was $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Please refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 13 - Derivatives for additional disclosures. \nRevenues decreased by 34% to $193.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $292.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 largely due to a 23% decrease in sales volumes coupled with a 14% decrease in oil equivalent pricing. The decreased volumes are a direct result of the Company suspending all drilling and completion activities after the first quarter of 2016. During the period from December 31, 2015 through December 31, 2016, we completed 21 gross wells in the Rocky Mountain region and drilled and completed no wells in the Mid-Continent region.\nThe

expense. Our lease operating expense decreased $21.4 million or 33%, to $43.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $65.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and decreased on an equivalent basis from $6.30 per Boe to $5.50 per Boe. The majority of the decrease is due to continued operating cost reductions along with decreased activity levels. The Company reduced operating costs and negotiated contract reductions resulting in decreased well servicing costs of $10.1 million, compression costs of $4.9 million and pumping and gauging costs of $2.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015.\nGas plant and midstream operating expense. Our gas plant and midstream operating expense increased $1.5 million to $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and increased on an equivalent basis from $1.10 per Boe to $1.62 per Boe. The increase in aggregate and on an equivalent basis is due to the start-up and continued buildout of RMI, which began in May of 2015.\nSeverance and ad valorem taxes. Our severance and ad valorem taxes decreased by 18%, or $3.3 million to $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Severance and ad valorem taxes primarily correlate to revenue. Revenues decreased by 33% for the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, which was offset by a tax refund received during the third quarter of 2015.\nExploration. Our exploration expense decreased $14.9 million to $0.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 from $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred minimal exploration charges. During the year ended December 31, 2015 we incurred charges of $5.6 million and $8.5 million for exploratory wells located in the North Park Basin and outside of our current development area in southern Arkansas, respectively, which we were unable to assign economic proved reserves. During 2015, we also paid $1.0 million and $0.7 million in geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals, respectively.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization. Our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense decreased $133.7 million, or 55%, to $111.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $244.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and decreased on an equivalent basis from $23.73 per Boe to $14.01 per Boe. The Company realized significant proved property impairments during the fourth quarter of 2015 resulting in a 50% decrease in the net proved property depletable base from the year ended December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016.\nImpairment of oil and gas properties. For the year ended December 31, 2016 we incurred an impairment of proved properties of $10.0 million, a $730.5 million decrease from the year ended December 31, 2015. We impaired our Mid-Continent assets by $10.0 million based on the most recent bid received during the first quarter of 2016, when it was held for sale. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we impaired our Mid-Continent assets by $321.2 million due to their depressed fair value upon classification as held for sale and our Rocky Mountain assets by $419.3 million due to low commodity prices. Please refer to Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion on our impairment policy and practice.\nAbandonment and impairment of unproved properties. For the year ended December 31, 2016 we incurred an abandonment and impairment of unproved properties of $24.7 million, an $8.9 million decrease from the prior year. Our 2016 abandonment and impairment charges related to non-core leases expiring within the Wattenberg Field. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $24.8 million of impairment charges relating to non-core leases expiring within the Wattenberg Field and $8.7 million of impairment charges to fully impair the North Park Basin due to a strategic shift in our development plan.\nUnused commitments. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $7.7 million in unused commitment fees. During 2015, we did not incur any fees of this nature. The unused commitment fees in 2016 of $4.3 million and $3.4 million are the result of water commitment deficiency payments and purchase and transportation agreement deficiency payments, respectively. Please see Note 8 - Commitments and Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion.\nContract settlement expense. For the year ended December 31, 2016 we incurred a $21.0 million loss to settle our crude oil purchase agreement with Silo as part of our bankruptcy process. There were no material settlements during 2015. Please see Note 8 - Commitments and Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion.\nGeneral and administrative expense. Our general and administrative expense increased $6.7 million, or 10%, to $77.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $70.3 million for the comparable period in 2015 and increased on an equivalent basis to $9.71 per Boe from $6.81 per Boe. The increase in general and administrative expense in 2016 on an aggregate and equivalent basis is due to $20.4 million of advisory fees related to our restructuring efforts and an increase of $1.2 million in severance payments. These cost increases were offset by a decrease in salaries and wages, including benefits of $9.3 million and stock compensation of $5.7 million due to reductions in workforce that have occurred since December 31, 2015.\nDerivative gain (loss). Our derivative loss increased $67.8 million to an $11.2 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 from a gain of $56.6 million for the comparable period in 2015. The decrease is related to a reduction of hedged volumes throughout 2016 and decreased contract prices at the time of conversion from three-way collars to swap and puts at the end of the first quarter of 2016 bringing them closer to realized prices during the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015. Please refer to Note 13 - Derivatives in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion.\nInterest expense. Our interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased 9% to $62.1 million compared to $57.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The interest expense increase is a result of increased average debt outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $1.0 billion, compared to $847.9 million for the comparable period in 2015. Total interest expense is comprised primarily of interest expense attributable to the Senior Notes including amortization\nof the premium and financing costs, which was $52.3 million and $52.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nIncome tax benefit (expense). Our estimate for federal and state income tax benefit for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was zero and $164.9 million, respectively. We are allowed to deduct various items for tax reporting purposes that are capitalized for purposes of financial statement presentation. Our effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was 0.0% and 18.1%, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, a full valuation was placed against the net deferred tax assets, which caused effective tax rate to differ from the U.S. statutory income tax rate.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe successor Company's anticipated sources of liquidity include cash from operating activities, borrowings under the successor credit facility, proceeds from sales of assets and potential proceeds from capital market transactions. Our cash flows from operating activities are subject to significant volatility due to changes in commodity prices for our crude oil, NGL and natural gas products, as well as variations in our production. The prices for these commodities are driven by a number of factors beyond our control, including global and regional product supply and demand, weather, product distribution, refining and processing capacity and other supply chain dynamics, among other factors.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our liquidity was $204.4 million, consisting of cash on hand of $12.7 million and $191.7 million of available borrowing capacity on the successor credit facility. As of the date of filing, we had $15.0 million outstanding on our successor credit facility.\nOn April 7, 2017, the Company's Plan was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, and the Plan became effective on April 28, 2017. Upon emergence from bankruptcy, we (i) executed the successor credit facility with an initial borrowing base of $191.7 million and maturity date of March 31, 2021 and (ii) issued new common stock as part of the $200.0 million rights offering and the $7.5 million transaction with the ad hoc equity committee. Please refer to Note 2 - Chapter 11 Proceedings and Emergence for additional details.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows and other financial measures for the periods indicated (in thousands).\nTable 247: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Successor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Predecessor\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>April 29, 2017 through December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 1, 2017 through April 28, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(19,884\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>226,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(82,648\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,904\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(67,401\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(452,573\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>(2,398\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>245,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>12,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition of oil and gas properties\n</td> <td>5,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Exploration and development of oil and gas properties\n</td> <td>76,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>425,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash flows provided by operating activities\nThe Current Successor Period included cash receipts and disbursements attributable to our normal operating cycle. The Current Predecessor Period contained the reorganization costs along with our normal operating receipts and disbursements. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities between the year ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 resulted primarily from a 13% decrease in crude oil equivalent pricing and a 23% decrease in sales volumes and a $112.7 million decrease in derivative cash settlements. See Results of Operations above for more information on the factors driving these changes.\nCash flows used in investing activities\nExpenditures for development of oil and natural gas properties are the primary use of our capital resources. The Company spent $81.8 million, $5.6 million, $52.4 million and $442.2 million for Current Successor Period, Current\nPredecessor Period, Prior Predecessor Periods for 2016 and 2015. The fluctuation in cash flows in investing activities is a direct result of the Company's entrance and emergence from bankruptcy.\nCash flows provided by financing activities\nNet cash used by financing activities for the Current Successor Period consisted of employee tax withholdings in exchanges for the return of common stock. Net cash provided by financing activities for the Current Predecessor Period consisted of proceeds from the rights offering of $207.5 million net of the $191.7 million repayment to the predecessor credit facility. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted primarily of net proceeds from the predecessor credit facility of $112.7 million. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of $202.7 million of net proceeds from the sale of common stock plus net borrowings of $46.0 million from our predecessor credit facility.\nCredit facility\nSuccessor Credit Facility\nThe administrative agent of our $191.7 million successor credit facility is KeyBank National Association. The successor credit facility provides for interest rates plus an applicable margin to be determined based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) or a base rate ( Base Rate\u201d), at the Company's election. LIBOR borrowings bear interest at LIBOR plus 3.00% to 4.00% depending on the utilization level, and the Base Rate borrowings bear interest at the Reference Rate,\u201d as defined in the successor credit facility, plus 2.00% to 3.00%.\nOur approved borrowing base under the successor credit facility, which was $191.7 million as of December 31, 2017, is redetermined semiannually as early as April and October of each year and up to one additional time between such scheduled determinations upon our request or upon the request of the required lenders (defined as lenders holding 662/3% of the aggregate commitments). The borrowing base is determined by the value of our oil and gas reserves but also takes into consideration such information as a repayment analysis of the Company's debt and the forecasted financial condition of the Company. The borrowing base is redetermined (i) in the sole discretion of the administrative agent and all of the lenders, (ii) in accordance with their customary internal standards and practices for valuing and redetermining the value of oil and gas properties in connection with reserve based oil and natural gas loan transactions, (iii) in conjunction with the most recent engineering report and other information received by the administrative agent and the lenders relating to our proved reserves and (iv) based upon the estimated value of our proved reserves as determined by the administrative agent and the lenders.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had nothing outstanding under the successor credit facility and had the ability to borrow up to the borrowing base of $191.7 million.\nOur obligations under the successor credit facility are secured by first priority liens on all of our property and assets (whether real, personal, or mixed, tangible or intangible), including our proved reserves and our oil and gas properties (which term is defined to include fee mineral interests, term mineral interests, leases, subleases, farm-outs, royalties, overriding royalties, net profit interests, carried interests, production payments, back in interests and reversionary interests). The successor credit facility is guaranteed by the Company and all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries.\nThe applicable margin varies on a daily basis based on the percentage outstanding under the borrowing base. We incur quarterly commitment fees based on the unused amount of the borrowing base of 0.50% per annum. We may prepay loans under the successor credit facility at any time without premium or penalty (other than customary LIBOR breakage costs).\nThe successor credit facility contains various covenants limiting our ability to:\n \u2022 grant or assume liens; \n \u2022 incur or assume indebtedness; \n \u2022 grant negative pledges or agree to restrict dividends or distributions from subsidiaries; \n \u2022 sell, transfer, assign or convey assets, or engage in certain mergers or acquisitions; \n \u2022 make certain distributions; \n \u2022 make certain loans, advances and investments; \n \u2022 materially change the character of our business as an oil and gas exploration and production company \n \u2022 engage in transactions with affiliates; \n \u2022 purchase or carry any margin stock; \n \u2022 enter into sale and leaseback, take-or-pay or hydrocarbon prepayment transactions; or \n \u2022 enter into certain swap agreements. \nThe successor credit facility also contains covenants requiring us to maintain:\n \u2022 a leverage ratio (i.e., the ratio of consolidated indebtedness, excluding indebtedness under surety bonds, performance bonds or hedge contracts, to earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion, and amortization, exploration expense and other non-cash charges ( EBITDAX\u201d)) not to exceed 3.50 to 1.00. \n \u2022 an interest coverage ratio (i.e., the ratio of the trailing twelve-month EBITDAX to trailing twelve-month interest expense) of not less than 2.50 to 1.00. \n \u2022 a current ratio (i.e., the ratio of current assets to current liabilities, excluding unsettled derivatives and the current portion of long-term debt) of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 (current assets include, as of the date of calculation, the aggregate of all lenders' unused commitment amounts); \nThe successor credit facility contains customary events of default, including:\n \u2022 failure to pay any principal, interest, fees, expenses or other amounts when due; \n \u2022 the failure of any representation or warranty to be materially true and correct when made; \n \u2022 failure to observe any agreement, obligation or covenant in the credit agreement, subject to cure periods for certain failures; \n \u2022 a cross-default for the payment of any other indebtedness of at least $5 million; \n \u2022 bankruptcy or insolvency; \n \u2022 judgments against us or our subsidiaries, in excess of $5 million, that are not stayed; \n \u2022 certain ERISA events involving us or our subsidiaries; and \n \u2022 a change in control (as defined in the successor credit facility), including the ownership by a person\u201d or group\u201d (as defined under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, but excluding certain permitted stockholders) directly or indirectly, of more than 35% of our common stock, other than certain of our current stockholders. \nAs of December 31, 2017, and through the filing date of this report, the Company is in compliance with all of the successor credit facility covenants.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have the following contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 270: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Delivery commitments(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office lease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset retirement obligations(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101,454\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>261,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>108,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________________\n (1) The Company has one purchase and transportation agreement and one operating lease. Please refer to Note 8 - Commitments and Contingencies for additional discussion on these agreements and for a description of our operating lease. \n (2) Amounts represent our estimated future retirement obligations on an undiscounted basis. The discounted obligations are recorded as liabilities on our accompanying balance sheets as of December 31, 2017. Because these costs typically extend many years into the future, management prepares estimates and makes judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors. Please see Note 11 - Asset Retirement Obligation, for additional discussion. \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We provide expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies, estimates and judgments below. We believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates made by management.\nMethod of accounting for oil and natural gas properties\nOil and natural gas exploration and development activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Under this method, all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized at cost when incurred, pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves. If an exploratory well does not find proved reserves, the costs of drilling the well are charged to expense. The costs of development wells are capitalized whether productive or nonproductive. All capitalized well costs and other associated costs and leasehold costs of proved properties are amortized on a unit-of-production basis over the remaining life of proved developed reserves and proved reserves, respectively.\nCosts of retired, sold or abandoned properties that constitute a part of an amortization base (partial field) are charged or credited, net of proceeds, to accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization unless doing so significantly affects the unit-of-production amortization rate for an entire field, in which case a gain or loss is recognized currently. Gains or losses from the disposal of properties are recognized currently.\nExpenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals necessary to maintain properties in operating condition are expensed as incurred. Major betterments, replacements and renewals are capitalized to the appropriate property and equipment accounts. Estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs for oil and natural gas properties are capitalized, net of salvage, at their estimated net present value and amortized on a unit-of-production basis over the remaining life of the related proved developed reserves.\nUnproved properties consist of costs incurred to acquire unproved leases, or lease acquisition costs. Unproved lease acquisition costs are capitalized until the leases expire or when we specifically identify leases that will revert to the lessor, at\nwhich time we expense the associated unproved lease acquisition costs. The expensing or expiration of unproved lease acquisition costs are recorded as abandonment or impairment of unproved properties in the statements of operations and comprehensive income in our consolidated financial statements. Lease acquisition costs related to successful exploratory drilling are reclassified to proved properties and depleted on a unit-of-production basis.\nFor sales of entire working interests in unproved properties, gain or loss is recognized to the extent of the difference between the proceeds received and the net carrying value of the property. Proceeds from sales of partial interests in unproved properties are accounted for as a recovery of costs unless the proceeds exceed the entire cost of the property.\nOil and natural gas reserve quantities and Standardized Measure\nIn the current year, our third-party petroleum consultant prepared our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and associated future net revenues. In the two years prior, our internal corporate reservoir engineering group prepared, and our third-party petroleum consultant audited our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and associated future net revenues. While the SEC has adopted rules which allow us to disclose proved, probable and possible reserves, we have elected to disclose only proved reserves in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The SEC's revised rules define proved reserves as the quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. Our internal corporate reservoir engineering group and our third party petroleum consultant must make a number of subjective assumptions based on their professional judgment in developing reserve estimates. Reserve estimates are updated annually and consider recent production levels and other technical information about each field. Oil and natural gas reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be precisely measured. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment.\nPeriodic revisions to the estimated reserves and future cash flows may be necessary as a result of a number of factors, including reservoir performance, oil and natural gas prices, cost changes, technological advances, new geological or geophysical data, or other economic factors. Accordingly, reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. We cannot predict the amounts or timing of future reserve revisions. If such revisions are significant, they could significantly affect future amortization of capitalized costs and result in impairment of assets that may be material.\nRevenue recognition\nRevenue from our interests in producing wells is recognized when the product is delivered, at which time the customer has taken title and assumed the risks and rewards of ownership, and collectability is reasonably assured. The sales prices for oil and natural gas are adjusted for transportation and other related deductions. These deductions are based on contractual or historical data and do not require significant judgment.\nSubsequently, these revenue deductions are adjusted to reflect actual charges based on third-party documents. Since there is a ready market for oil and natural gas, we sell the majority of production soon after it is produced at various locations.\nImpairment of proved properties\nWe review our proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value may have occurred and at least annually. We estimate the expected undiscounted future cash flows of our oil and natural gas properties and compare such undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the oil and natural gas properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, we will adjust the carrying amount of the oil and natural gas properties to fair value. The factors used to determine fair value are subject to our judgment and expertise and include, but are not limited to, recent sales prices of comparable properties, the present value of future cash flows, net of estimated operating and development costs using estimates of proved reserves, future commodity pricing, future production estimates, anticipated capital expenditures, and various discount rates commensurate with the risk and current market conditions associated with realizing the expected cash flows projected. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these factors, we cannot predict when or if future impairment charges for proved properties will be recorded.\nImpairment of unproved properties\nWe assess our unproved properties periodically for impairment on a property-by-property basis based on remaining lease terms, drilling results or future plans to develop acreage and record abandonment and impairment expense for any decline in value.\nWe have historically recognized abandonment and impairment expense for unproved properties at the time when the lease term has expired or sooner if, in management's judgment, the unproved properties have lost some or all of their carrying value. We consider the following factors in our assessment of the impairment of unproved properties:\n \u2022 the remaining amount of unexpired term under our leases; \n \u2022 our ability to actively manage and prioritize our capital expenditures to drill leases and to make payments to extend leases that may be closer to expiration; \n \u2022 our ability to exchange lease positions with other companies that allow for higher concentrations of ownership and development; \n \u2022 our ability to convey partial mineral ownership to other companies in exchange for their drilling of leases; and \n \u2022 our evaluation of the continuing successful results from the application of completion technology in the Wattenberg Field by us or by other operators in areas adjacent to or near our unproved properties. \nThe assessment of unproved properties to determine any possible impairment requires significant judgment.\nAsset retirement obligations\nWe record the fair value of a liability for a legal obligation to retire an asset in the period in which the liability is incurred with the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. For oil and gas properties, this is the period in which the well is drilled or acquired. The asset retirement obligation ( ARO\u201d) for oil and gas properties represents the estimated amount we will incur to plug, abandon and remediate the properties at the end of their productive lives, in accordance with applicable state laws. The liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated on the unit-of-production method. The accretion expense is recorded as a component of depreciation, depletion and amortization in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nWe determine the ARO by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows related to the liability. Estimating the future ARO requires management to make estimates and judgments regarding timing, existence of a liability, as well as what constitutes adequate restoration. Inherent in the fair value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate costs, inflation factors, credit-adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the fair value of the existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the related asset.\nDerivatives\nWe record all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at their estimated fair value. We have not designated any derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes and we do not enter into such instruments for speculative trading purposes. Derivative instruments are adjusted to fair value every accounting period. Derivative cash settlements and gains and losses from valuation changes in the remaining unsettled commodity derivative instruments are reported under derivative gain (loss) in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nStock-based compensation\nRestricted Stock Units. We recognize compensation expense for all restricted stock units made to employees and directors. Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. The fair value of restricted stock grants is based on the value of our common stock on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation expense recorded for restricted stock units is included in general and administrative expenses on our accompanying statements of operations.\nStock Options. We recognize compensation expense for all stock option awards made to employees. Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. The fair value of stock option grants is based on a Black-Scholes Model. Stock-based compensation expense recorded for stock option awards is included in general and administrative expenses on our accompanying statements of operations.\nIncome taxes\nOur provision for taxes includes both federal and state taxes. We record our federal income taxes in accordance with accounting for income taxes under GAAP which results in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance would be established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized.\nWe apply significant judgment in evaluating our tax positions and estimating our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The actual outcome of these future tax consequences could differ significantly from our estimates, which could impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe also account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the"}
