Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this filing. The discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including those set forth under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nGeneral\nWe are a diversified, multi-national healthcare enterprise that provides services to government sponsored and commercial healthcare programs, focusing on under-insured and uninsured individuals. We provide member-focused services through locally based staff by assisting in accessing care, coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions.\nResults of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits (including estimated costs incurred) and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs. We measure operating performance based upon two key ratios. The health benefits ratio (HBR) represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues, excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues that are separately billed, and reflects the direct relationship between the premiums received and the medical services provided. The SG&A expense ratio represents SG&A costs as a percentage of premium and service revenues, excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues that are separately billed.\nOn December 12, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a two-for-one split of our common stock in the form of a 100% stock dividend distributed on February 6, 2019 to stockholders of record as of December 24, 2018. All share, per share and stock price information presented in this Form 10-K has been adjusted for the two-for-one stock split.\nFidelis Care Acquisition\nOn July 1, 2018, we acquired substantially all of the assets of New York State Catholic Health Plan, Inc., d/b/a Fidelis Care New York (Fidelis Care) for approximately $3.6 billion of cash consideration, which includes a working capital adjustment. The cash consideration was funded through approximately $2.8 billion of new equity, and approximately $1.8 billion of new long-term debt. Both offerings were completed in May 2018. The Fidelis Care Acquisition expanded our health plan footprint to New York State. As a result of the completion of the Fidelis Care Acquisition, our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 include the results of operations of Fidelis Care from July 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018. Due to the size of the acquisition, one of the primary drivers of the year-over-year variances discussed throughout this section is related to the Fidelis Care Acquisition.\nAs part of the regulatory approval process in connection with the Fidelis Care Acquisition, we entered into certain undertakings with the New York State Department of Health. These undertakings contain various commitments by us effective upon completion of the Fidelis Care Acquisition. One of the undertakings includes a $340 million contribution by us to the State of New York to be paid over a five-year period for initiatives consistent with our mission of providing high quality healthcare to vulnerable populations within New York State. The present value of the $340 million contribution to the State of New York, approximately $328 million, was expensed during 2018.\nAcquisitions and Investments\nWe continued to execute on our growth strategy through acquisitions and investments during 2018. In the first quarter of 2018, we acquired Community Medical Holdings Corp., d/b/a Community Medical Group (CMG), an at-risk primary care provider serving Medicaid, Medicare Advantage, and Health Insurance Marketplace patients in Miami-Dade County, Florida. CMG has a multi-payor strategy and serves members of our Florida health plan. The acquisition increases our scale and capabilities and creates a vertical integration opportunity with providers. In the first quarter of 2018, we also acquired an additional 61% ownership in Interpreta Holdings, Inc. (Interpreta), a clinical and genomics data analytics business, bringing our total ownership to 80%. In the first and second quarters of 2018, we completed a 28% equity method investment in RxAdvance (RxA), a full-service pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) with an innovative technology platform. In the third quarter of 2018, we made an additional investment in RxA in the form of convertible preferred stock. Both the Interpreta and RxA transactions reflect our commitment to technological innovation and providing comprehensive and integrated specialty services.\nIn the second quarter of 2018, we acquired MHM Services Inc. (MHM), a provider of behavioral health, medical and dental services to correctional facilities, state hospitals, courts, juvenile facilities and community clinics. Under the terms of the agreement, we also acquired the remaining 49% ownership of Centurion, the correctional healthcare services joint venture between MHM and us, expanding our national footprint in the correctional healthcare sector.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, our Spanish subsidiary, Primero Salud, acquired 89% of Torrej\u00f3n Salud, the concessionaire of the University Hospital of Torrej\u00f3n de Ardoz in the Community of Madrid, expanding our presence in Spain.\nRegulatory Trends and Uncertainties\nIn December 2018, a federal district judge in Texas ruled that the entire Affordable Care Act (ACA) is unconstitutional in the case of Texas v. United States of America.\u201d The case centers on the argument that the law's individual mandate requirement was essential to the ACA, and without it, the remainder of the ACA was invalid. The Company remains focused on the promise of delivering access to quality, affordable healthcare to all of its members, following the District Court decision regarding the constitutionality of the ACA. The ACA will remain in its current form for 2019. We believe the ACA will remain in its current form or in modified form that ensures the continuation of coverage for existing members beyond 2019.\nWe have more than three decades of experience, spanning six presidents from both sides of the aisle, in delivering high-quality healthcare services on behalf of states and the Federal government to uninsured families, commercial organizations and military families. We continue to believe we have both the capacity and capability to successfully navigate industry changes to the benefit of our members, customers and shareholders.\nFor additional information regarding regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 \"Business - Regulation\" and Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\"\n2018 Highlights\nOur financial performance for 2018 is summarized as follows:\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Year-end managed care membership of 14.0 million, an increase of 1.8 million members, or 15% over 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Total revenues of $60.1 billion, representing 24% growth year-over-year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>HBR of 85.9% for 2018, compared to 87.3% for 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>SG&A expense ratio of 10.7% for 2018, compared to 9.7% for 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Adjusted SG&A expense ratio of 10.0% for 2018, compared to 9.5% for 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Diluted EPS of $2.26 for 2018, compared to $2.34 for 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Adjusted Diluted EPS of $3.54 for 2018, compared to $2.52 for 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Operating cash flows of $1.2 billion, or 1.4 times net earnings, for 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA reconciliation from GAAP diluted EPS to Adjusted Diluted EPS is highlighted below, and additional detail is provided above under the heading \"Non-GAAP Financial Presentation\":\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Centene\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of acquired intangible assets\n</td> <td>0.41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition related expenses\n</td> <td>0.81\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other adjustments (1)\n</td> <td>0.06\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.14\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Diluted EPS\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Other adjustments include the following items:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>2018 - the impact of retroactive changes to the California minimum MLR of $30 million or $0.06 per diluted share, net of an income tax benefit of $0.02; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>2017 - (a) the Penn Treaty assessment expense of $56 million or $0.10 per diluted share, net of an income tax benefit of $0.06; (b) the cost sharing reduction (CSR) expense of $22 million or $0.04 per diluted share, net of an income tax benefit of $0.02; (c) the charitable contribution commitment of $40 million or $0.07 per diluted share, net of an income tax benefit of $0.05, and (d) the benefit associated with income tax reform of $125 million or $0.35 per diluted share.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 2018 results include the following items, which in the aggregate had no net effect on diluted EPS:\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>During the year ended December 31, 2018, we received 2014-2017 cost reconciliation information related to the California Medicaid in-home support services (IHSS) program, which ended December 31, 2017.

Health Insurance Marketplace business, expansions and new programs in many of our states, and the reinstatement of the health insurer fee in 2018. This was partially offset by lower revenues as a result of the removal of the IHSS program from California's Medicaid contract in January 2018. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, we received Medicaid premium rate adjustments which yielded a net 1% composite change across all of our markets.\nOperating Expenses\nMedical Costs\nResults of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits and to accurately estimate costs incurred. The HBR represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues, excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues that are separately billed, and reflects the direct relationship between the premiums received and the medical services provided.\nThe HBR for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 85.9%, a decrease of 140 basis points over the comparable period in 2017. The HBR decrease compared to last year was driven by membership growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business, the reinstatement of the health insurer fee in 2018, and the recognition of the previously mentioned IHSS program reconciliation. This was partially offset by the acquisition of Fidelis Care, which operates at a higher HBR.\nCost of Services\nCost of services increased by $539 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period in 2017. This was primarily due to the acquisition of Foundation Care in October 2017 and growth in our correctional services business, including the acquisition of MHM.\nThe cost of service ratio for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 85.0%, compared to 81.5% in 2017. The cost of service ratio was negatively impacted by approximately 110 basis points for the costs associated with the Veterans Affairs contract expiration. The increase in the cost of service ratio was also due to lower margins associated with our other federal services business and growth in our specialty pharmacy business due to the acquisition of Foundation Care in October 2017, which operates at a higher cost of service ratio. These increases were partially offset by growth in our correctional services business resulting from the acquisition of MHM, which operates at a lower cost of service ratio.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A increased by $1.6 billion in the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period in 2017. This was primarily due to the acquisition of Fidelis Care, including acquisition related expenses, costs associated with the previously mentioned Veterans Affairs contract expiration, and expansions, new programs and growth in many of our states in 2018, including growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business. These increases were partially offset by the $56 million recognized during 2017 for our estimated share of the undiscounted guaranty association assessment resulting from the liquidation of Penn Treaty.\nThe SG&A expense ratio was 10.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 9.7% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to increased acquisition related expenses. The Adjusted SG&A expense ratio was 10.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 9.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The SG&A and Adjusted SG&A expense ratios both increased due to growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business and the impact of the removal of the IHSS program from California's Medicaid contract in January 2018. These increases in both ratios were partially offset by the acquisition of Fidelis Care.\nHealth Insurer Fee Expense\nHealth insurance fee expense was $709 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. As a result of the health insurer fee moratorium, which suspended the health insurance provider fee for the 2017 calendar year, we did not record health insurer fee expense for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOther Income (Expense)\nThe following table summarizes the components of other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, ($ in millions):\nTable 231: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment and other income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>190\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(343\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(255\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(90\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(65\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in investment income in 2018 reflects higher interest rates and investment balances over 2017, including the impact of higher investment balances as a result of organic portfolio growth and the Fidelis Care acquisition. These increases were partially offset by 2017 interest income from the State of Illinois related to capitation payment delays. Interest expense increased by $88 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period in 2017, reflecting a net increase in borrowings, primarily related to the financing of the Fidelis Care acquisition and the effect of our interest rate swaps.\nIncome Tax Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded income tax expense of $474 million on pre-tax earnings of $1.4 billion, or an effective tax rate of 34.6%. The effective tax rate reflects the lower corporate tax rate as enacted in the TCJA, partially offset by an increased tax rate due to the non-deductibility of the health insurer fee. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded income tax expense of $326 million on pre-tax earnings of $1.1 billion, or an effective tax rate of 28.7%, which reflects the higher corporate tax rate for 2017, the one-time effects of the TCJA, and the impact of the health insurer fee moratorium.\nSegment Results\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated operating results by segment for the year ended December 31, ($ in millions):\nTable 232: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n2017-2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Managed Care\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specialty Services\n</td> <td>12,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Eliminations\n</td> <td>(9,489\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,515\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from Operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Managed Care\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specialty Services\n</td> <td>148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManaged Care\nTotal revenues increased 25% in the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period in 2017, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Fidelis Care and expansions, new programs, and growth in many of our states, particularly Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and Texas, including growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business. Total revenues also increased as a result of the reinstatement of the health insurer fee in 2018. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the removal of the IHSS program from California's Medicaid contract in January 2018 and a reduction in pass through payments from the State of California in 2018 compared to 2017. Earnings from operations increased $393 million between years primarily as a result of the acquisition of Fidelis Care, growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business, and the reinstatement of the health insurer fee in 2018, partially offset by increased acquisition related expenses. In addition, 2017 was negatively impacted by the Penn Treaty assessment expense.\nSpecialty Services\nTotal revenues increased 4% in the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period in 2017, resulting primarily from increased services associated with membership growth in the Managed Care segment and acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by a decline in revenue for our behavioral health services business as a result of many states combining these services within our physical health contracts in order to integrate physical and behavioral health care to achieve a more holistic care model for our members. Earnings from operations decreased $134 million between years primarily due to costs associated with the previously mentioned Veterans Affairs contract expiration and lower margins in our other federal services and behavioral health services businesses, partially offset by growth in our pharmacy benefits management business.\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2019, we expect lower earnings in our Specialty Services segment and corresponding higher earnings in our Managed Care segment as we move to transparent pharmacy pricing. This reflects our commitment to transparency and more closely aligns the costs of care within each segment. It also aligns with our continued transition to the next generation RxAdvance pharmacy platform during 2019 and 2020.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nTotal Revenues\nTable 233: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change 2016-2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medicaid\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>8,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medicare (1)\n</td> <td>4,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>2,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,803\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Medicare includes Medicare Advantage, Medicare Supplement, Special Needs Plans, and MMP.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenues increased 19% in the year ended December 31, 2017, over the corresponding period in 2016, primarily as a result of a full year of Health Net's results, as well as the impact of growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business in 2017 and expansions and new programs in many of our states in 2016 and 2017. This was partially offset by the moratorium of the health insurer fee in 2017, lower membership in the commercial business in California as a result of margin improvement actions taken in 2016, and lower specialty pharmacy revenues. As a result of the health insurer fee moratorium, which suspended the health insurance provider fee for the 2017 calendar year, we did not recognize health insurer fee revenue in 2017, compared to $531 million recognized in 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we received Medicaid premium rate adjustments which yielded an approximate net 1% composite rate change across all of our markets.\nOperating Expenses\nMedical Costs\nThe HBR for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 87.3%, an increase of 80 basis points over the comparable period in 2016. The increase compared to last year was primarily a result of the $195 million of revenue recognized in 2016 relating to the minimum MLR change in California, which reduced the 2016 HBR by 50 basis points, a premium rate reduction for California Medicaid Expansion effective July 1, 2017, an increase in flu related costs over 2016, and the impact of new or expanded health plans, which initially operate at a higher HBR. These increases were partially offset by growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business, which operates at a lower HBR.\nCost of Services\nCost of services decreased by $17 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the corresponding period in 2016. This was primarily due to lower specialty pharmacy sales and decreased costs associated with our federal services business, partially offset by growth in our correctional business. The cost of service ratio for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 81.5%, compared to 85.5% in 2016. The decrease in the cost of service ratio is primarily due to decreased costs associated with our federal services business and the results of the shared savings programs in our home-based primary care business.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A increased by $773 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the corresponding period in 2016. This was primarily a result of:\nTable 234: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a full year of the Health Net business in our 2017 results;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 235: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the impact of new programs in many of our states in 2016 and 2017;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 236: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>higher business expansion costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 237: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>additional expense recognized for our estimated share of the undiscounted guaranty association assessment resulting from the liquidation of Penn Treaty; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 238: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>higher variable compensation expenses based on the performance of the business in 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increases above are partially offset by a decrease in acquisition related expenses of $214 million.\nThe SG&A expense ratio was 9.7% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 9.8% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in the SG&A expense ratio was primarily attributable to lower acquisition related expenses, partially offset by higher business expansion costs over 2016, the Penn Treaty assessment and our results including a full year of the Health Net business, which operates at a higher SG&A expense ratio due to a greater mix of commercial and Medicare business.\nThe Adjusted SG&A expense ratio was 9.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 9.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in the Adjusted SG&A expense ratio was primarily attributable to higher business expansion costs over 2016 and a full year of the Health Net business in our 2017 results, which operates at a higher SG&A expense ratio due to a greater mix of commercial and Medicare business.\nHealth Insurer Fee Expense\nAs a result of the health insurer fee moratorium, which suspended the health insurance provider fee for the 2017 calendar year, we did not recognize health insurer fee expense for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $461 million recognized for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOther Income (Expense)\nThe following table summarizes the components of other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, ($ in millions):\nTable 239: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment and other income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(255\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(217\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(65\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(103\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in investment income in 2017 reflects higher interest rates and investment balances over 2016, as well as interest income from the State of Illinois related to capitation payment delays. Interest expense increased during the year ended December 31, 2017 by $38 million due to an increase in net borrowings, primarily related to the issuance of an additional $2.4 billion in senior notes in February 2016 in connection with the financing of the Health Net transaction.\nIncome Tax Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded income tax expense of $326 million on pre-tax earnings of $1.1 billion, or an effective tax rate of 28.7%. The effective tax rate reflects the effect of income tax reform and the health insurer fee moratorium. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded lower income tax expense of $125 million related to the provisional effect of the income tax rate reduction, primarily represented as a reduction to our deferred income tax liabilities. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded income tax expense of $599 million on pre-tax earnings of $1.2 billion, or an effective tax rate of 51.6%, which reflects the non-deductibility of the health insurer fee expense as well as the non-deductibility of certain acquisition related costs incurred in connection with the closing of our acquisition of Health Net.\nSegment Results\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated operating results by segment for the year ended December 31, ($ in millions):\nTable 240: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n2016-2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Managed Care\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specialty Services\n</td> <td>12,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Eliminations\n</td> <td>(9,515\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,152\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(55\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from Operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Managed Care\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specialty Services\n</td> <td>282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn January 2017, we reclassified Cenpatico Behavioral Health of Arizona, LLC and the related Cenpatico Integrated Care health plan from the Specialty Services segment to the Managed Care segment due to a reorganization of the Arizona management structure following the Health Net integration. As a result, the financial results of Cenpatico Behavioral Health of Arizona, LLC and the related Cenpatico Integrated Care health plan have been reclassified from the Specialty Services segment to the Managed Care segment for all periods presented.\nManaged Care\nTotal revenues increased 19% in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the corresponding period in 2016, primarily as a result of a full year of the Health Net business in our 2017 results and growth, expansions or new programs in many of our states, particularly Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, and Texas, partially offset by the health insurer fee moratorium. Earnings from operations decreased $163 million between years primarily as a result of the $195 million of revenue recognized in 2016 relating to the minimum MLR change in California, the health insurer fee moratorium in 2017, and new or expanded health plans, which initially operate at a higher HBR and incur start-up costs. These drivers were partially offset by $214 million of lower acquisition related expenses and growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business.\nSpecialty Services\nTotal revenues increased 44% in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the corresponding period in 2016, resulting primarily from the a full year of the Health Net business in our 2017 results, the continued integration of Health Net into our specialty services, increased services associated with membership growth in the Managed Care segment, and growth in our correctional services and home-based primary care businesses. Earnings from operations increased $99 million between years primarily due to a full year of the Health Net business in our 2017 results.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nShown below is a condensed schedule of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, used in the discussion of liquidity and capital resources ($ in millions).\nTable 241: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(4,585\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,254\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,469\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>4,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(82\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows Provided by Operating Activities\nNormal operations are funded primarily through operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Cash flows from operating activities for 2018 were $1.2 billion, or 1.4 times net earnings, compared to $1.5 billion in 2017. The cash provided by operations in 2018 was primarily due to net earnings and an increase in medical claims liabilities, primarily resulting from growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business. Cash flows from operations were partially offset by an increase in premium and trade receivables of $1.2 billion, due to growth in the business. Additionally, cash flows from operations were negatively affected by the repayment of approximately $1.0 billion of Medicaid expansion rate overpayments and Medicaid expansion MLR rebates in California, which was previously accrued.\nCash flows from operating activities for 2017 was $1.5 billion, compared to $1.9 billion in 2016. Cash provided by operations in 2017 was primarily due to net earnings, an increase in medical claims liabilities resulting from growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business and the commencement of the Nebraska and Nevada health plans. Cash flows from operating activities for 2016 was $1.9 billion. Cash provided by operations in 2016 was primarily due to net earnings, an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and medical claims liabilities, and a decrease in other assets and premium and trade receivables. Additionally, cash provided by operations in 2016 was increased by approximately $445 million due to the timing of cash receipts shortly following the acquisition date.\nCash flows from operations in each year were impacted by the timing of payments we received from our states. States may prepay the following month premium payment, which we record as unearned revenue, or they may delay our premium payment, which we record as a receivable. We typically receive capitation payments monthly; however, the states in which we operate may decide to adjust their payment schedules which could positively or negatively impact our reported cash flows from operating activities in any given period.\nTable 242: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Increase) decrease in premium and trade receivables\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,173\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(50\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in unearned revenue\n</td> <td>(52\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in operating cash flow\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,225\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(31\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>117\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nInvesting activities used cash of $4.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, $1.3 billion in 2017, and $2.5 billion in 2016. Cash flows used in investing activities in 2018 primarily consisted of the Fidelis Care and other acquisitions, the net additions to the investment portfolio of our regulated subsidiaries (including transfers from cash and cash equivalents to long-term investments), the investments in RxAdvance, and capital expenditures.\nWe spent $675 million and $422 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, on capital expenditures for system enhancements and market and corporate headquarters expansions.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed-income securities with a weighted average duration of 3.3 years. We had unregulated cash and investments of $478 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $310 million at December 31, 2017. Unregulated cash and investments include private equity investments and company owned life insurance contracts.\nCash flows used in investing activities in 2017 primarily consisted of net additions to the investment portfolio of our regulated subsidiaries, including transfers from cash and cash equivalents to long-term investments, and capital expenditures.\nCash flows used in investing activities in 2016 primarily consisted of our acquisition of Health Net, net additions to the investment portfolio of our regulated subsidiaries, including transfers from cash and cash equivalents to long-term investments, and capital expenditures. In March 2016, we acquired Health Net for approximately $6.0 billion, including the assumption of $703 million of debt. The total consideration for the acquisition was $5.3 billion, consisting of Centene common shares valued at $3.0 billion, $2.2 billion in cash, and $2 million related to the fair value adjustment to stock based compensation associated with pre-combination service.\nCash Flows Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities\nOur financing activities provided cash of $4.6 billion in 2018, compared to using cash of $82 million in 2017 and providing cash of $2.7 billion in 2016, respectively. Financing activities in 2018, 2017 and 2016 are discussed below.\nDuring 2018, our net financing activities primarily related to our offering of $2.8 billion in shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, approximately $1.8 billion of 5.375% senior notes at par due 2026, and additional borrowings on our revolving credit agreement. Proceeds from both offerings were used to fund the Fidelis Care acquisition which closed on July 1, 2018, to pay related fees and expenses, and for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding indebtedness. Cash flows provided by financing activities were partially offset by common stock repurchases resulting from stock relinquished to us by employees for payment of taxes upon vesting of restricted stock units and the purchase of noncontrolling interest.\nDuring 2017, our net financing activities primarily related to common stock repurchases resulting from stock relinquished to us by employees for payment of taxes upon vesting of restricted stock units and the purchase of noncontrolling interest, partially offset by increased borrowings on our revolving credit agreement. In December 2017, we amended and increased our $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (Revolving Credit Facility) to $1.5 billion.\nDuring 2016, our financing activities primarily related to the proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in February 2016 associated with the Health Net acquisition, the issuance of additional senior notes in June 2016 and November 2016, partially offset by the redemption of our 5.75% senior notes due 2017, the redemption of our 6.375% senior notes due 2017, and the repayment of amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility.\nIn February 2016, our wholly owned unrestricted subsidiary (Escrow Issuer) issued $1.4 billion of 5.625% senior notes ($1.4 Billion Notes) at par due 2021 and $1.0 billion of 6.125% senior notes ($1.0 Billion Notes) at par due 2024. We used the net proceeds of the offering, together with borrowings under the our new $1.0 billion revolving credit facility and cash on hand, to fund the cash consideration for the Health Net acquisition and to pay acquisition and offering related fees and expenses. In connection with the February 2016 issuance, we entered into interest rate swap agreements for notional amounts of $600 million and $1.0 billion, at floating rates of interest based on the three month LIBOR plus 4.22% and the three month LIBOR plus 4.44%, respectively. Gains and losses due to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps completely offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt and are recorded as an adjustment to the $1.4 Billion Notes and $1.0 Billion Notes.\nIn connection with the closing of the Health Net acquisition on March 24, 2016, our then-existing unsecured $500 million revolving credit facility was terminated and simultaneously replaced with the Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under the agreement bear interest based upon LIBOR rates, the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate.\nIn June 2016, we issued an additional $500 million of 4.75% senior notes due 2022 at a premium to yield 4.41% ($500 Million Add-on Notes). The $500 Million Add-on Notes were offered as additional debt securities under the indenture governing the $500 million of 4.75% senior notes issued April 2014. We used the net proceeds of the offering to repay amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility and to pay offering related fees and expenses.\nIn November 2016, we issued $1.2 billion of 4.75% senior notes due 2025 ($1.2 Billion Notes). We used the net proceeds to redeem our $425 million of 5.75% senior notes due 2017 and Health Net's $400 million of 6.375% senior notes due 2017, to repay amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility, to pay related fees and expenses and for general purposes.\nLiquidity Metrics\nThe credit agreement underlying our Revolving Credit Facility contains non-financial and financial covenants, including requirements of minimum fixed charge coverage ratios and maximum debt-to-EBITDA ratios. We are required to not exceed a maximum debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.5 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2018, we had $284 million in borrowings outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility, and we were in compliance with all covenants. As of December 31, 2018, there were no limitations on the availability under the revolving credit agreement as a result of the debt-to-EBITDA ratio.\nWe have a $200 million non-recourse construction loan to fund the expansion of our corporate headquarters. The loan bears interest based on the one month LIBOR plus 2.70% and matures in April 2021 with an optional one-year extension. The agreement contains financial and non-financial covenants aligning with our revolving credit agreement. We have guaranteed completion of the construction project associated with the loan. As of December 31, 2018, we had $63 million of borrowings outstanding under the loan.\nWe had outstanding letters of credit of $56 million as of December 31, 2018, which were not part of our revolving credit facility. We also had letters of credit for $27 million (valued at the December 31, 2018 conversion rate), or \u20ac24 million, representing our proportional share of the letters of credit issued to support Ribera Salud's outstanding debt which are a part of the revolving credit facility. Collectively, the letters of credit bore weighted interest of 0.99% as of December 31, 2018. In addition, we had outstanding surety bonds of $496 million as of December 31, 2018.\nThe indentures governing our various maturities of senior notes contain non-financial and financial covenants of Centene Corporation, including requirements of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants.\nAs discussed above, in May 2018, we issued approximately $2.8 billion of new equity, and approximately $1.8 billion of 5.375% senior notes at par due 2026. Proceeds from the offerings were used to fund the Fidelis Care acquisition which closed on July 1, 2018, to pay related fees and expenses, and for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding indebtedness.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, of $27 million, compared to negative $629 million at December 31, 2017. We manage our short-term and long-term investments with the goal of ensuring that a sufficient portion is held in investments that are highly liquid and can be sold to fund short-term requirements as needed.\nAt December 31, 2018, our debt to capital ratio, defined as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and total equity, was 37.8%, compared to 40.6% at December 31, 2017. Excluding the $120 million non-recourse mortgage note and construction loan, our debt to capital ratio was 37.4% as of December 31, 2018, compared to 40.3% at December 31, 2017. We utilize the debt to capital ratio as a measure, among others, of our leverage and financial flexibility.\nWe have a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to 16 million shares of common stock from time to time on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. We have 7 million available shares remaining under the program for repurchases as of December 31, 2018. No duration has been placed on the repurchase program. We reserve the right to discontinue the repurchase program at any time. We did not make any repurchases under this plan during 2018, 2017 or 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we received dividends of $475 million, $312 million, and $121 million, respectively, from our regulated subsidiaries.\n2019 Expectations\nDuring 2019, we expect to make net capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries of approximately $327 million associated with our growth and spend approximately $650 million in additional capital expenditures primarily associated with system enhancements and market and corporate headquarters expansions. These amounts are expected to be funded by unregulated cash flow generation and borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility and construction loan. However, from time to time we may elect to raise additional funds for these and other purposes, either through issuance of debt or equity, the sale of investment securities or otherwise, as appropriate. In addition, we may strategically pursue refinancing opportunities to extend maturities and/or improve terms of our indebtedness if we believe such opportunities are favorable to us.\nBased on our operating plan, we expect that our available cash, cash equivalents and investments, cash from our operations and cash available under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our general operations and capital expenditures for at least 12 months from the date of this filing.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe following table summarizes future contractual obligations. These obligations contain estimates and are subject to revision under a number of circumstances.

This consists primarily of long-term deferred income taxes, liabilities under our deferred compensation plan, liabilities related to certain undertakings, reserves for uncertain tax positions and retirement benefit obligations. These liabilities have been excluded from the table above as the timing and/or amount of any cash payment is uncertain.\nCommitments\nAs part of the regulatory approval process in connection with the Fidelis Care Acquisition, we entered into certain undertakings with the New York State Department of Health. These undertakings contain various commitments by us that were effective upon completion of the Fidelis Care Acquisition. One of the undertakings includes a $340 million contribution by us to the State of New York to be paid over a five-year period for initiatives consistent with our mission of providing high quality healthcare to vulnerable populations within New York State. The present value of the contribution to the State of New York, approximately $328 million, was expensed during 2018.\nIn addition, in connection with obtaining regulatory approval of the Health Net acquisition from the California Department of Insurance and the California Department of Managed Health Care, in 2016 we committed to certain undertakings (the California Undertakings). The California Undertakings included, among other items, operational commitments around premiums, dividend restrictions, minimum Risk Based Capital (RBC) levels, local offices, growth, accreditation, HEDIS scores and other quality measures, network adequacy, certifications, investments and capital expenditures. Specifically, we agreed to, among other things:\nTable 244: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>invest an additional $30 million through the California Organized Investment Network over the five years following completion of the acquisition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 245: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>build a service center in an economically distressed community in California, investing $200 million over 10 years and employing at least 300 people, of which we have incurred $8 million through 2018;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 246: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>contribute $65 million to improve enrollee health outcomes ($10 million over five years), support locally-based consumer assistance programs ($5 million over five years) and strengthen the healthcare delivery system ($50 million over five years), of which we have contributed $13 million through 2018, and;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 247: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>invest $75 million of its investment portfolio in vehicles supporting California's healthcare infrastructure, of which we have invested $12 million through 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The California Undertakings require significant investments by us, may restrict or impose additional material costs on our future obligations and strategic initiatives in certain geographies, and subject us to various enforcement mechanisms.\nREGULATORY CAPITAL AND DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS\nOur operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. As managed care organizations, most of our subsidiaries are subject to state regulations and other requirements that, among other things, require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state, and restrict the timing, payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us. Generally, the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity's level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus.\nOur regulated subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital requirements prescribed by various regulatory authorities in each of the states in which we operate. As of December 31, 2018, our subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $7,259 million, compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus requirements of $3,279 million. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we contributed $154 million of net statutory capital to our subsidiaries. For our subsidiaries that file with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), we estimate our RBC percentage to be in excess of 350% of the Authorized Control Level.\nUnder the California Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, as amended ( Knox-Keene\u201d), certain of our California subsidiaries must comply with tangible net equity (TNE) requirements. Under these Knox-Keene TNE requirements, actual net worth less unsecured receivables and intangible assets must be more than the greater of (i) a fixed minimum amount, (ii) a minimum amount based on premiums or (iii) a minimum amount based on healthcare expenditures, excluding capitated amounts. In addition, certain of our California subsidiaries have made certain undertakings to the DMHC to restrict dividends and loans to affiliates, to the extent that the payment of such would reduce such entities' TNE below the required amount as specified in the undertaking.\nUnder the New York State Department of Health Codes, Rules and Regulations Title 10, Part 98, our New York subsidiary must comply with contingent reserve requirements. Under these requirements, net worth based upon admitted assets must equal or exceed a minimum amount based on annual net premium income.\nThe NAIC has adopted rules which set minimum risk-based capital requirements for insurance companies, managed care organizations and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage. As of December 31, 2018, each of our health plans was in compliance with the risk-based capital requirements enacted in those states.\nAs a result of the above requirements and other regulatory requirements, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to make dividend payments, loans or other transfers of cash to their parent companies. Such restrictions, unless amended or waived or unless regulatory approval is granted, limit the use of any cash generated by these subsidiaries to pay our obligations. The maximum amount of dividends that can be paid by our insurance company subsidiaries without prior approval of the applicable state insurance departments is subject to restrictions relating to statutory surplus, statutory income and unassigned surplus. As of December 31, 2018, the amount of capital and surplus or net worth that was unavailable for the payment of dividends or return of capital to us was $3,279 million in the aggregate.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nFor this information, refer to Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included herein.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOur discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. Our accounting policies regarding intangible assets, medical claims liability and revenue recognition are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management. As a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe have made several acquisitions that have resulted in our recording of intangible assets. These intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, purchased contract rights, provider contracts, trade names and goodwill. Key assumptions used in the valuation of these intangible assets include, but are not limited to, member attrition rates, contract renewal probabilities, revenue growth rates, expectations of profitability, discount and royalty rates. We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is generally attributable to the value of the synergies between the combined companies and the value of the acquired assembled workforce, neither of which qualifies for recognition as an intangible asset. At December 31, 2018, we had $7,015 million of goodwill and $2,239 million of other intangible assets.\nIntangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over the following periods:\nTable 248: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intangible Asset\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amortization Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchased contract rights\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 - 15 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provider contracts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4 - 15 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer relationships\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 15 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade names\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7 - 20 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Developed technologies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2 - 7 years\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. If the events or circumstances indicate that the remaining balance of the intangible asset or goodwill may be impaired, the potential impairment will be measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount of the intangible asset or goodwill and the fair value of such asset. Our management must make assumptions and estimates, such as the discount factor, future utility and other internal and external factors, in determining the estimated fair values. While we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate, other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results.\nGoodwill is reviewed annually during the fourth quarter for impairment. In addition, an impairment analysis of intangible assets would be performed based on other factors. These factors include significant changes in membership, state funding, medical contracts and provider networks and contracts.\nWe first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. We generally do not calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. However, in certain circumstances, such as recent acquisitions, we may elect to perform a quantitative assessment without first assessing qualitative factors. The goodwill of $267 million associated with our home health business is expected to be recovered. However, the penetration of this business model into our Medicaid population has been slower than anticipated. The associated decreased profitability has been offset by the performance of our shared savings demonstration programs. To the extent the demonstration programs change substantially in advance of the Medicaid penetration, the reporting unit could be at risk for impairment.\nMedical Claims Liability\nOur medical claims liability includes claims reported but not yet paid, or inventory, estimates for claims incurred but not reported, or IBNR, and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period. We estimate our medical claims liability using actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet Actuarial Standards of Practice. These actuarial methods consider factors such as historical data for payment patterns, cost trends, product mix, seasonality, utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors.\nActuarial Standards of Practice generally require that the medical claims liability estimates be adequate to cover obligations under moderately adverse conditions. Moderately adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of estimate. In many situations, the claims amounts ultimately settled will be different than the estimate that satisfies the Actuarial Standards of Practice. We include in our IBNR an estimate for medical claims liability under moderately adverse conditions which represents the risk of adverse deviation of the estimates in our actuarial method of reserving.\nWe use our judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required estimates. The assumptions we consider when estimating IBNR include, without limitation, claims receipt and payment experience (and variations in that experience), changes in membership, provider billing practices, healthcare service utilization trends, cost trends, product mix, seasonality, prior authorization of medical services, benefit changes, known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza, provider contract changes, changes to fee schedules, and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims.\nWe apply various estimation methods depending on the claim type and the period for which claims are being estimated. For more recent periods, incurred non-inpatient claims are estimated based on historical per member per month claims experience adjusted for known factors. Incurred hospital inpatient claims are estimated based on known inpatient utilization data and prior claims experience adjusted for known factors. For older periods, we utilize an estimated completion factor based on our historical experience to develop IBNR estimates. The completion factor is an actuarial estimate of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have been received or adjudicated as of the reporting period to the estimate of the total ultimate incurred costs. When we commence operations in a new state or region, we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability. See Risk Factors - Failure to accurately estimate and price our medical expenses or effectively manage our medical costs or related administrative costs could negatively affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\u201d These approaches are consistently applied to each period presented.\nAdditionally, we contract with independent actuaries to review our estimates on a quarterly basis. The independent actuaries provide us with a review letter that includes the results of their analysis of our medical claims liability. We do not solely rely on their report to adjust our claims liability. We utilize their calculation of our claims liability only as additional information, together with management's judgment, to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of our liability for claims.\nOur development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as additional claims receipts and payment information becomes available. As more complete claims information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimates, and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the changes are identified. In every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical claims liability estimates associated with previously reported periods. We consistently apply our reserving methodology from period to period. As additional information becomes known to us, we adjust our actuarial models accordingly to establish medical claims liability estimates.\nThe paid and received completion factors, claims per member per month and per diem cost trend factors are the most significant factors affecting the IBNR estimate. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on December 31, 2018 data:\nTable 249: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Completion Factors: (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cost Trend Factors: (2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Decrease)\nIncrease\nin Factors\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease) in\nMedical Claims\nLiabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Decrease)\nIncrease\nin Factors\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease) in\nMedical Claims\nLiabilities\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1.00\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.00\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(77\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(0.75\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.75\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(58\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(0.50\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.50\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(39\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(0.25\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.25\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>0.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(73\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>0.50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(145\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>0.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(217\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(288\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Reflects estimated potential changes in medical claims liability caused by changes in completion factors.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2) Reflects estimated potential changes in medical claims liability caused by changes in cost trend factors for the most recent periods.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhile we believe our estimates are appropriate, it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates. For example, a 1% increase or decrease in our estimated medical claims liability would have affected net earnings by $45 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, excluding the effect of any return of premium, risk corridor, or minimum MLR programs. The estimates are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our providers and information available from other outside sources.\nThe change in medical claims liability is summarized as follows (in millions):\nTable 250: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, January 1,\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: reinsurance recoverable\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, January 1, net\n</td> <td>4,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions\n</td> <td>1,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: acquired reinsurance recoverable\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Incurred related to:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current year\n</td> <td>46,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prior years\n</td> <td>(427\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(374\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(310\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total incurred\n</td> <td>46,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Paid related to:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current year\n</td> <td>41,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prior years\n</td> <td>3,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total paid\n</td> <td>44,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, December 31, net\n</td> <td>6,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: reinsurance recoverable\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, December 31,\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Days in claims payable (1)\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Days in claims payable is a calculation of medical claims liability at the end of the period divided by average expense per calendar day for the fourth quarter of each year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMedical claims are usually paid within a few months of the member receiving service from the physician or other healthcare provider. As a result, the liability generally is described as having a short-tail,\u201d which causes less than 5% of our medical claims liability as of the end of any given year to be outstanding the following year. We believe that substantially all the development of the estimate of medical claims liability as of December 31, 2018 will be known by the end of 2019.\nChanges in estimates of incurred claims for prior years are primarily attributable to reserving under moderately adverse conditions. Additionally, as a result of minimum HBR and other return of premium programs, approximately $25 million, $1 million and $39 million of the Incurred related to: Prior years\u201d was recorded as a reduction to premium revenues in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Further, claims processing initiatives yielded increased claim payment recoveries and coordination of benefits related to prior year dates of service. Changes in medical utilization and cost trends and the effect of medical management initiatives may also contribute to changes in medical claim liability estimates. While we have evidence that medical management initiatives are effective on a case by case basis, medical management initiatives primarily focus on events and behaviors prior to the incurrence of the medical event and generation of a claim. Accordingly, any change in behavior, leveling of care, or coordination of treatment occurs prior to claim generation and as a result, the costs prior to the medical management initiative are not known by us. Additionally, certain medical management initiatives are focused on member and provider education with the intent of influencing behavior to appropriately align the medical services provided with the member's acuity. In these cases, determining whether the medical management initiative changed the behavior cannot be determined. Because of the complexity of our business, the number of states in which we operate, and the volume of claims that we process, we are unable to practically quantify the impact of these initiatives on our changes in estimates of IBNR.\nThe following are examples of medical management initiatives that may have contributed to the favorable development through lower medical utilization and cost trends:\nTable 251: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Appropriate leveling of care for neonatal intensive care unit hospital admissions, other inpatient hospital admissions, and observation admissions, in accordance with InterQual or other criteria.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 252: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Management of our pre-authorization list and more stringent review of durable medical equipment and injectibles.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 253: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Emergency department program designed to collaboratively work with hospitals to steer non-emergency care away from the costly emergency department setting (through patient education, on-site alternative urgent care settings, etc.).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 254: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Increased emphasis on case management and clinical rounding where case managers are nurses or social workers who are employed by the health plan to assist selected patients with the coordination of healthcare services in order to meet a patient's specific healthcare needs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 255: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Incorporation of disease management which is a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, collaborative approach to chronic illnesses such as asthma.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 256: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Prenatal and infant health programs utilized in our Start Smart For Your Baby outreach service.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue Recognition\nOur health plans generate revenues primarily from premiums received from the states in which we operate health plans, premiums received from our members and CMS for our Medicare product, and premiums from members of our commercial health plans. In addition to member premium payments, our Marketplace contracts also generate revenues from subsidies received from CMS. We generally receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our contracts and recognize premium revenues during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members at the amount reasonably estimable. In some instances, our base premiums are subject to an adjustment, or risk score, based on the acuity of its membership. Generally, the risk score is determined by the State or CMS analyzing submissions of processed claims data to determine the acuity of our membership relative to the entire state's membership. We estimate the amount of risk adjustment based upon the processed claims data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS and record revenues on a risk adjusted basis. Some contracts allow for additional premiums related to certain supplemental services provided such as maternity deliveries.\nOur contracts with states may require us to maintain a minimum HBR or may require us to share profits in excess of certain levels. In certain circumstances, including commercial plans, our plans may be required to return premium to the state or policyholders in the event profits exceed established levels. We estimate the effect of these programs and recognize reductions in revenue in the current period. Other states may require us to meet certain performance and quality metrics in order to receive additional or full contractual revenue. For performance-based contracts, we do not recognize revenue subject to refund until data is sufficient to measure performance.\nRevenues are recorded based on membership and eligibility data provided by the states or CMS, which is adjusted on a monthly basis by the states or CMS for retroactive additions or deletions to membership data. These eligibility adjustments are estimated monthly and subsequent adjustments are made in the period known. We continuously review and updates those estimates as new information becomes available. It is possible that new information could require us to make additional adjustments, which could be significant, to these estimates.\nOur Medicare Advantage contracts are with CMS. CMS deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model pays more for members whose medical history would indicate that they are expected to have higher medical costs. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, physician treatment settings as well as prescription drug events. We and the healthcare providers collect, compile and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. We estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS and record revenues on a risk adjusted basis.\nOur specialty services generate revenues under contracts with state and federal programs, healthcare organizations and other commercial organizations, as well as from our own subsidiaries. Revenues are recognized when the related services are provided or as ratably earned over the covered period of services. We recognize revenue related to administrative services under the TRICARE government-sponsored managed care support contract on a straight-line basis over the option period, when the fees become fixed and determinable. The TRICARE contract includes various performance-based measures. For each of the measures, an estimate of the amount that has been earned is made at each interim date, and revenue is recognized accordingly.\nSome states enact premium taxes, similar assessments and provider pass-through payments, collectively premium taxes, and these taxes are recorded as a separate component of both revenues and operating expenses. Additionally, our insurance subsidiaries are subject to the Affordable Care Act annual HIF. The ACA imposed the HIF in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2018. The HIF was suspended in 2017 and 2019. If we are able to negotiate reimbursement of portions of these premium taxes or the HIF, we recognize revenue associated with the HIF on a straight-line basis when we have binding agreements for such reimbursements, including the gross-up\u201d to reflect the HIFs non-tax deductible nature. Collectively, this revenue is recorded as premium tax and health insurer fee revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For certain products, premium taxes, state assessments and the HIF are not pass-through payments and are recorded as premium revenue and premium tax expense or health insurer fee expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I am unable to understand the table you've provided me with.\n- Each cell seems to contain a placeholder, and there are no headings to indicate the purpose of the table or the order of the information.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this filing. The discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including those set forth under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nGeneral\nWe are a diversified, multi-national healthcare enterprise that provides services to government sponsored and commercial healthcare programs, focusing on under-insured and uninsured individuals. We provide member-focused services through locally based staff by assisting in accessing care, coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions.\nResults of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits (including estimated costs incurred) and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs. We measure operating performance based upon two key ratios. The health benefits ratio (HBR) represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues, excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues that are separately billed, and reflects the direct relationship between the premiums received and the medical services provided. The SG&A expense ratio represents SG&A costs as a percentage of premium and service revenues, excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues that are separately billed.\nOn December 12, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a two-for-one split of our common stock in the form of a 100% stock dividend distributed on February 6, 2019 to stockholders of record as of December 24, 2018. All share, per share and stock price information presented in this Form 10-K has been adjusted for the two-for-one stock split.\nFidelis Care Acquisition\nOn July 1, 2018, we acquired substantially all of the assets of New York State Catholic Health Plan, Inc., d/b/a Fidelis Care New York (Fidelis Care) for approximately $3.6 billion of cash consideration, which includes a working capital adjustment. The cash consideration was funded through approximately $2.8 billion of new equity, and approximately $1.8 billion of new long-term debt. Both offerings were completed in May 2018. The Fidelis Care Acquisition expanded our health plan footprint to New York State. As a result of the completion of the Fidelis Care Acquisition, our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 include the results of operations of Fidelis Care from July 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018. Due to the size of the acquisition, one of the primary drivers of the year-over-year variances discussed throughout this section is related to the Fidelis Care Acquisition.\nAs part of the regulatory approval process in connection with the Fidelis Care Acquisition, we entered into certain undertakings with the New York State Department of Health. These undertakings contain various commitments by us effective upon completion of the Fidelis Care Acquisition. One of the undertakings includes a $340 million contribution by us to the State of New York to be paid over a five-year period for initiatives consistent with our mission of providing high quality healthcare to vulnerable populations within New York State. The present value of the $340 million contribution to the State of New York, approximately $328 million, was expensed during 2018.\nAcquisitions and Investments\nWe continued to execute on our growth strategy through acquisitions and investments during 2018. In the first quarter of 2018, we acquired Community Medical Holdings Corp., d/b/a Community Medical Group (CMG), an at-risk primary care provider serving Medicaid, Medicare Advantage, and Health Insurance Marketplace patients in Miami-Dade County, Florida. CMG has a multi-payor strategy and serves members of our Florida health plan. The acquisition increases our scale and capabilities and creates a vertical integration opportunity with providers. In the first quarter of 2018, we also acquired an additional 61% ownership in Interpreta Holdings, Inc. (Interpreta), a clinical and genomics data analytics business, bringing our total ownership to 80%. In the first and second quarters of 2018, we completed a 28% equity method investment in RxAdvance (RxA), a full-service pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) with an innovative technology platform. In the third quarter of 2018, we made an additional investment in RxA in the form of convertible preferred stock. Both the Interpreta and RxA transactions reflect our commitment to technological innovation and providing comprehensive and integrated specialty services.\nIn the second quarter of 2018, we acquired MHM Services Inc. (MHM), a provider of behavioral health, medical and dental services to correctional facilities, state hospitals, courts, juvenile facilities and community clinics. Under the terms of the agreement, we also acquired the remaining 49% ownership of Centurion, the correctional healthcare services joint venture between MHM and us, expanding our national footprint in the correctional healthcare sector.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, our Spanish subsidiary, Primero Salud, acquired 89% of Torrej\u00f3n Salud, the concessionaire of the University Hospital of Torrej\u00f3n de Ardoz in the Community of Madrid, expanding our presence in Spain.\nRegulatory Trends and Uncertainties\nIn December 2018, a federal district judge in Texas ruled that the entire Affordable Care Act (ACA) is unconstitutional in the case of Texas v. United States of America.\u201d The case centers on the argument that the law's individual mandate requirement was essential to the ACA, and without it, the remainder of the ACA was invalid. The Company remains focused on the promise of delivering access to quality, affordable healthcare to all of its members, following the District Court decision regarding the constitutionality of the ACA. The ACA will remain in its current form for 2019. We believe the ACA will remain in its current form or in modified form that ensures the continuation of coverage for existing members beyond 2019.\nWe have more than three decades of experience, spanning six presidents from both sides of the aisle, in delivering high-quality healthcare services on behalf of states and the Federal government to uninsured families, commercial organizations and military families. We continue to believe we have both the capacity and capability to successfully navigate industry changes to the benefit of our members, customers and shareholders.\nFor additional information regarding regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 \"Business - Regulation\" and Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\"\n2018 Highlights\nOur financial performance for 2018 is summarized as follows:\n \u2022 Year-end managed care membership of 14.0 million, an increase of 1.8 million members, or 15% over 2017. \n \u2022 Total revenues of $60.1 billion, representing 24% growth year-over-year. \n \u2022 HBR of 85.9% for 2018, compared to 87.3% for 2017. \n \u2022 SG&A expense ratio of 10.7% for 2018, compared to 9.7% for 2017. \n \u2022 Adjusted SG&A expense ratio of 10.0% for 2018, compared to 9.5% for 2017. \n \u2022 Diluted EPS of $2.26 for 2018, compared to $2.34 for 2017. \n \u2022 Adjusted Diluted EPS of $3.54 for 2018, compared to $2.52 for 2017. \n \u2022 Operating cash flows of $1.2 billion, or 1.4 times net earnings, for 2018. \nA reconciliation from GAAP diluted EPS to Adjusted Diluted EPS is highlighted below, and additional detail is provided above under the heading \"Non-GAAP Financial Presentation\":\n\n (1) Other adjustments include the following items: \n \u2022 2018 - the impact of retroactive changes to the California minimum MLR of $30 million or $0.06 per diluted share, net of an income tax benefit of $0.02; and \n \u2022 2017 - (a) the Penn Treaty assessment expense of $56 million or $0.10 per diluted share, net of an income tax benefit of $0.06; (b) the cost sharing reduction (CSR) expense of $22 million or $0.04 per diluted share, net of an income tax benefit of $0.02; (c) the charitable contribution commitment of $40 million or $0.07 per diluted share, net of an income tax benefit of $0.05, and (d) the benefit associated with income tax reform of $125 million or $0.35 per diluted share. \nThe 2018 results include the following items, which in the aggregate had no net effect on diluted EPS:\n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2018, we received 2014-2017 cost reconciliation information related to the California Medicaid in-home support services (IHSS) program, which ended December 31, 2017. As a result, our 2018 results include an estimated pre-tax benefit of $140 million related to the IHSS program reconciliation. The 2014-2016 reconciliation is expected to be finalized by early 2019, with the final 2017 reconciliation to follow. \n \u2022 On September 30, 2018, our contract to provide health care coordination services to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs under the Patient-Centered Community Care and Veterans Choice Programs expired. In connection with the conclusion of the contract, during the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $110 million for negotiated settlements and severance costs. We will continue to provide close out and transition services through 2021. \n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded pre-tax expense of $30 million associated with a contribution commitment to our charitable foundation. \nThe following items contributed to our revenue and membership growth in 2018 and 2017:\n \u2022 Arizona. In October 2018, our Arizona subsidiary, Health Net Access, began providing physical and behavioral health care services under a new integrated contract through the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System Complete Care program in the Central region and the Southern region. In January 2017, we continued our participation as a qualified health plan issuer in the Arizona Health Insurance Marketplace and exited the Health Net preferred provider organization offerings in Arizona. \n \u2022 Arkansas. In February 2018, our Arkansas subsidiary, Arkansas Total Care, began managing a Medicaid special needs population comprised of people with high behavioral health needs and individuals with developmental/intellectual disabilities. Arkansas Total Care is expected to assume full-risk on this population beginning in March 2019. \n \u2022 CMG. In March 2018, we completed the acquisition of CMG, an at-risk primary care provider serving Medicaid, Medicare Advantage, and Health Insurance Marketplace patients in Miami-Dade County, Florida. \n \u2022 Correctional. In December 2018, Centurion began operating under a new contract to provide comprehensive healthcare services to detainees of Volusia County detention facilities located near Daytona, Florida. In April 2018, we completed the acquisition of MHM, a national provider of healthcare and staffing services to correctional systems and other government agencies. Under the terms of the agreement, Centene also acquired the remaining 49% ownership of Centurion, the correctional healthcare services joint venture between Centene and MHM. In June 2017, Centurion began operating under an expanded contract to provide correctional healthcare services for the Florida Department of Corrections in South Florida. \n \u2022 Fidelis Care. In July 2018, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Fidelis Care for $3.6 billion of cash consideration, making Fidelis Care Centene's health plan in New York State. \n \u2022 Health Insurance Marketplace. In January 2018, we expanded our offerings in the 2018 Health Insurance Marketplace. We entered Kansas, Missouri and Nevada, and expanded our footprint in the following six existing markets: Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Ohio, Texas, and Washington. In January 2017, we added over 500,000 new members across our Health Insurance Marketplace service areas. \n \u2022 Health Net Federal Services. In January 2018, our subsidiary, Health Net Federal Services, began operating under the TRICARE West Region contract to provide administrative services to Military Health System eligible beneficiaries. \n \u2022 Illinois. In January 2018, our Illinois subsidiary, IlliniCare Health, began operating under a state-wide contract for the Medicaid Managed Care Program. Implementation dates varied by region and the contract was fully implemented statewide in April 2018. The new contract will include children who are in need through the Department of Children and Family Services/Youth in Care by the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services and Foster Care. These additional products are expected to be implemented in 2019. \n \u2022 Interpreta. In March 2018, we acquired an additional 61% ownership in Interpreta, a clinical and genomics data analytics business, bringing our total ownership to 80%. \n \u2022 Maryland. In July 2017, our specialty solutions subsidiary, Envolve, Inc., began providing health plan management services for Medicaid operations in Maryland. \n \u2022 Medicare. In January 2018, we expanded our offerings in Medicare. We entered Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Washington and expanded our footprint in Ohio. \n \u2022 Missouri. In May 2017, our Missouri subsidiary, Home State Health, began providing managed care services to MO HealthNet Managed Care beneficiaries under an expanded statewide contract. \n \u2022 Nebraska. In January 2017, our Nebraska subsidiary, Nebraska Total Care, began operating under a contract with the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services' Division of Medicaid and Long-Term Care as one of three managed care organizations to administer its new Heritage Health Program for Medicaid, ABD, CHIP, Foster Care and LTSS enrollees. \n \u2022 Nevada. In July 2017, our Nevada subsidiary, SilverSummit Healthplan, began serving Medicaid recipients enrolled in Nevada's Medicaid managed care program. \n \u2022 Pennsylvania. In January 2018, our Pennsylvania subsidiary, Pennsylvania Health & Wellness, began serving enrollees in the Community HealthChoices program. Contract commencement dates vary by zone and will be fully implemented statewide by January 2020. \n \u2022 RxAdvance. In March 2018, we made a 25% equity method investment in RxAdvance, a full-service PBM, and expect to use its platform to improve health outcomes and reduce avoidable drug-impacted medical and administrative costs. This partnership includes both a customer relationship and a strategic investment in RxAdvance. As part of the initial transaction, Centene has certain rights to expand its equity investment in the future. In May 2018, we made an additional investment in RxAdvance, bringing the total ownership to 28%. In September 2018, we made an additional investment in convertible preferred stock. In 2018, we began moving our health plans onto the RxAdvance pharmacy platform, beginning with the transition of our Mississippi health plan in December 2018. \n \u2022 Washington. In January 2018, our Washington State subsidiary, Coordinated Care of Washington, began providing managed care services to Apple Health's Fully Integrated Managed Care beneficiaries in the North Central Region. \n \u2022 In addition, we realized the full year benefit in 2017 of acquisitions, investments, and business commenced during 2016, including the March 2016 acquisition of Health Net for $6.0 billion, including the assumption of debt. \nThe growth items listed above were partially offset by the following items:\n \u2022 We were successful in reprocuring our contracts in Georgia, Indiana, and Mississippi. However, the Medicaid programs were expanded to include additional insurers, which has reduced our market share. In addition, we are no longer serving LTSS members in Arizona or Medicaid and correctional members in Massachusetts. \n \u2022 Beginning in January 2018, the State of California no longer includes costs for IHSS in its Medicaid contracts. \n \u2022 Effective October 2018, we no longer provide health care coordination services to veterans under the Patient-Centered Community Care and Veterans Choice Programs. \nWe expect the following items to contribute to our revenue or future growth potential:\n \u2022 We expect to realize the full year benefit in 2019 of acquisitions, investments, and business commenced during 2018, as discussed above. \n \u2022 In February 2019, our North Carolina joint venture, Carolina Complete Health, was awarded a contract for the Medicaid Managed Care program. Under the agreement, Carolina Complete Health will provide Medicaid managed care services in Regions 3 and 5. Pending regulatory approval, the new three-year contract is effective February 1, 2020. \n \u2022 In February 2019, Centurion began operating under a new contract to provide comprehensive healthcare services to detainees of the Metropolitan Detention Center located in Albuquerque, New Mexico. \n \u2022 In January 2019, Centurion was notified by Arizona's Department of Corrections of the state's intent to award a contract to provide comprehensive healthcare services to inmates housed in Arizona's state prison system. The contract is expected to commence July 1, 2019, subject to customary contract negotiation. \n \u2022 In January 2019, we expanded our offerings in the 2019 Health Insurance Marketplace. We entered North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Tennessee, and expanded our footprint in six existing markets: Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri and Texas. \n \u2022 In January 2019, our New Mexico subsidiary, Western Sky Community Care, began operating under a new statewide contract in New Mexico for the Centennial Care 2.0 Program. \n \u2022 In January 2019, our Pennsylvania subsidiary, Pennsylvania Health & Wellness, began serving enrollees in the Community HealthChoices program in the Southeast region as part of the statewide contract that is expected to be fully implemented by January 2020. \n \u2022 In January 2019, our Kansas subsidiary, Sunflower Health Plan, continued providing managed care services to KanCare beneficiaries statewide under a new contract. \n \u2022 In December 2018, our Spanish subsidiary, Primero Salud, acquired 89% of Torrej\u00f3n Salud, a public-private partnership in the Community of Madrid. \n \u2022 In December 2018, our Florida subsidiary, Sunshine Health, began providing physical and behavioral health care services through Florida's Statewide Medicaid Managed Care Program under its new five year contract which was implemented for all 11 regions by February 2019. \n \u2022 In October 2018, CMS published updated Medicare Star quality ratings for the 2019 rating year. Our Star ratings returned to a 4.0 Star parent rating. The 2019 rating year will positively affect quality bonus payments for Medicare Advantage plans in 2020. \n \u2022 In July 2018, we announced a joint venture with Ascension to establish a Medicare Advantage plan. The plan is expected to be implemented in multiple geographic markets beginning in 2020. \n \u2022 In July 2018, our subsidiary, Health Net Federal Services, was awarded the next generation Military & Family Life Counseling Program contract. The awarded contract is up to ten years, including multiple one-year option periods. \n \u2022 In July 2018, Centurion began operating under a contract to provide healthcare services for correctional facilities in Pima County, Arizona. In addition, Centurion's contracts for correctional facilities were reprocured in Florida, New Hampshire and Tennessee. \n \u2022 In May 2018, our Iowa subsidiary, Iowa Total Care, Inc., was selected to negotiate a new statewide contract for the IA Health Link Program. The contract is expected to commence on July 1, 2019. \nThe future growth items listed above are partially offset by the following item:\n \u2022 In the first quarter of 2018, Health Net of Arizona, Inc. notified the Arizona Department of Insurance of its decision to discontinue and non-renew all of its Employer Group plans for small and large business groups in Arizona beginning January 1, 2019. The effective date of coverage termination for existing groups is dependent on remaining renewals; however, coverage will no longer be provided to any group policyholders and/or members after December 31, 2019. \n \u2022 We were successful in reprocuring our contract in Washington. However, we expect market share to decrease as a result of the award. \nMEMBERSHIP\nFrom December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2018, we increased our managed care membership by 2.6 million, or 23%. The following table sets forth our membership by line of business:\n\nThe following table sets forth additional membership statistics, which are included in the membership information above:\n\nFrom December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, our membership increased as a result of:\n \u2022 the Fidelis Care Acquisition; and \n \u2022 membership growth in our Health Insurance Marketplace service areas. \nThese increases were partially offset by a net decrease in our behavioral health membership as many states are combining these services within our physical health contracts in order to integrate physical and behavioral health care to achieve a more holistic care model for our members.\nFrom December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, our membership increased as a result of:\n \u2022 membership growth in our Health Insurance Marketplace service areas; \n \u2022 the commencement of health plan management services for Medicaid operations in Maryland; \n \u2022 an expanded statewide managed care contract in Missouri; and \n \u2022 the commencement of new managed care contracts in Nebraska and Nevada. \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis is based on our Consolidated Statements of Operations, which reflect our results of operations for each of the three years ended December 31, 2018, prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ($ in millions, except per share data in dollars):\n\nn.m.: not meaningful\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nTotal Revenues\nThe following table sets forth supplemental revenue information for the year ended December 31, ($ in millions):\n\nTotal revenues increased 24% in the year ended December 31, 2018, over the corresponding period in 2017, primarily due to the acquisition of Fidelis Care, growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business, expansions and new programs in many of our states, and the reinstatement of the health insurer fee in 2018. This was partially offset by lower revenues as a result of the removal of the IHSS program from California's Medicaid contract in January 2018. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, we received Medicaid premium rate adjustments which yielded a net 1% composite change across all of our markets.\nOperating Expenses\nMedical Costs\nResults of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits and to accurately estimate costs incurred. The HBR represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues, excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues that are separately billed, and reflects the direct relationship between the premiums received and the medical services provided.\nThe HBR for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 85.9%, a decrease of 140 basis points over the comparable period in 2017. The HBR decrease compared to last year was driven by membership growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business, the reinstatement of the health insurer fee in 2018, and the recognition of the previously mentioned IHSS program reconciliation. This was partially offset by the acquisition of Fidelis Care, which operates at a higher HBR.\nCost of Services\nCost of services increased by $539 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period in 2017. This was primarily due to the acquisition of Foundation Care in October 2017 and growth in our correctional services business, including the acquisition of MHM.\nThe cost of service ratio for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 85.0%, compared to 81.5% in 2017. The cost of service ratio was negatively impacted by approximately 110 basis points for the costs associated with the Veterans Affairs contract expiration. The increase in the cost of service ratio was also due to lower margins associated with our other federal services business and growth in our specialty pharmacy business due to the acquisition of Foundation Care in October 2017, which operates at a higher cost of service ratio. These increases were partially offset by growth in our correctional services business resulting from the acquisition of MHM, which operates at a lower cost of service ratio.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A increased by $1.6 billion in the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period in 2017. This was primarily due to the acquisition of Fidelis Care, including acquisition related expenses, costs associated with the previously mentioned Veterans Affairs contract expiration, and expansions, new programs and growth in many of our states in 2018, including growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business. These increases were partially offset by the $56 million recognized during 2017 for our estimated share of the undiscounted guaranty association assessment resulting from the liquidation of Penn Treaty.\nThe SG&A expense ratio was 10.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 9.7% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to increased acquisition related expenses. The Adjusted SG&A expense ratio was 10.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 9.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The SG&A and Adjusted SG&A expense ratios both increased due to growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business and the impact of the removal of the IHSS program from California's Medicaid contract in January 2018. These increases in both ratios were partially offset by the acquisition of Fidelis Care.\nHealth Insurer Fee Expense\nHealth insurance fee expense was $709 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. As a result of the health insurer fee moratorium, which suspended the health insurance provider fee for the 2017 calendar year, we did not record health insurer fee expense for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOther Income (Expense)\nThe following table summarizes the components of other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, ($ in millions):\n\nThe increase in investment income in 2018 reflects higher interest rates and investment balances over 2017, including the impact of higher investment balances as a result of organic portfolio growth and the Fidelis Care acquisition. These increases were partially offset by 2017 interest income from the State of Illinois related to capitation payment delays. Interest expense increased by $88 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period in 2017, reflecting a net increase in borrowings, primarily related to the financing of the Fidelis Care acquisition and the effect of our interest rate swaps.\nIncome Tax Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded income tax expense of $474 million on pre-tax earnings of $1.4 billion, or an effective tax rate of 34.6%. The effective tax rate reflects the lower corporate tax rate as enacted in the TCJA, partially offset by an increased tax rate due to the non-deductibility of the health insurer fee. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded income tax expense of $326 million on pre-tax earnings of $1.1 billion, or an effective tax rate of 28.7%, which reflects the higher corporate tax rate for 2017, the one-time effects of the TCJA, and the impact of the health insurer fee moratorium.\nSegment Results\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated operating results by segment for the year ended December 31, ($ in millions):\n\nManaged Care\nTotal revenues increased 25% in the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period in 2017, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Fidelis Care and expansions, new programs, and growth in many of our states, particularly Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and Texas, including growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business. Total revenues also increased as a result of the reinstatement of the health insurer fee in 2018. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the removal of the IHSS program from California's Medicaid contract in January 2018 and a reduction in pass through payments from the State of California in 2018 compared to 2017. Earnings from operations increased $393 million between years primarily as a result of the acquisition of Fidelis Care, growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business, and the reinstatement of the health insurer fee in 2018, partially offset by increased acquisition related expenses. In addition, 2017 was negatively impacted by the Penn Treaty assessment expense.\nSpecialty Services\nTotal revenues increased 4% in the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period in 2017, resulting primarily from increased services associated with membership growth in the Managed Care segment and acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by a decline in revenue for our behavioral health services business as a result of many states combining these services within our physical health contracts in order to integrate physical and behavioral health care to achieve a more holistic care model for our members. Earnings from operations decreased $134 million between years primarily due to costs associated with the previously mentioned Veterans Affairs contract expiration and lower margins in our other federal services and behavioral health services businesses, partially offset by growth in our pharmacy benefits management business.\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2019, we expect lower earnings in our Specialty Services segment and corresponding higher earnings in our Managed Care segment as we move to transparent pharmacy pricing. This reflects our commitment to transparency and more closely aligns the costs of care within each segment. It also aligns with our continued transition to the next generation RxAdvance pharmacy platform during 2019 and 2020.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nTotal Revenues\n\nTotal revenues increased 19% in the year ended December 31, 2017, over the corresponding period in 2016, primarily as a result of a full year of Health Net's results, as well as the impact of growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business in 2017 and expansions and new programs in many of our states in 2016 and 2017. This was partially offset by the moratorium of the health insurer fee in 2017, lower membership in the commercial business in California as a result of margin improvement actions taken in 2016, and lower specialty pharmacy revenues. As a result of the health insurer fee moratorium, which suspended the health insurance provider fee for the 2017 calendar year, we did not recognize health insurer fee revenue in 2017, compared to $531 million recognized in 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we received Medicaid premium rate adjustments which yielded an approximate net 1% composite rate change across all of our markets.\nOperating Expenses\nMedical Costs\nThe HBR for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 87.3%, an increase of 80 basis points over the comparable period in 2016. The increase compared to last year was primarily a result of the $195 million of revenue recognized in 2016 relating to the minimum MLR change in California, which reduced the 2016 HBR by 50 basis points, a premium rate reduction for California Medicaid Expansion effective July 1, 2017, an increase in flu related costs over 2016, and the impact of new or expanded health plans, which initially operate at a higher HBR. These increases were partially offset by growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business, which operates at a lower HBR.\nCost of Services\nCost of services decreased by $17 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the corresponding period in 2016. This was primarily due to lower specialty pharmacy sales and decreased costs associated with our federal services business, partially offset by growth in our correctional business. The cost of service ratio for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 81.5%, compared to 85.5% in 2016. The decrease in the cost of service ratio is primarily due to decreased costs associated with our federal services business and the results of the shared savings programs in our home-based primary care business.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A increased by $773 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the corresponding period in 2016. This was primarily a result of:\n \u2022 a full year of the Health Net business in our 2017 results; \n \u2022 the impact of new programs in many of our states in 2016 and 2017; \n \u2022 higher business expansion costs; \n \u2022 additional expense recognized for our estimated share of the undiscounted guaranty association assessment resulting from the liquidation of Penn Treaty; and \n \u2022 higher variable compensation expenses based on the performance of the business in 2017. \nThe increases above are partially offset by a decrease in acquisition related expenses of $214 million.\nThe SG&A expense ratio was 9.7% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 9.8% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in the SG&A expense ratio was primarily attributable to lower acquisition related expenses, partially offset by higher business expansion costs over 2016, the Penn Treaty assessment and our results including a full year of the Health Net business, which operates at a higher SG&A expense ratio due to a greater mix of commercial and Medicare business.\nThe Adjusted SG&A expense ratio was 9.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 9.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in the Adjusted SG&A expense ratio was primarily attributable to higher business expansion costs over 2016 and a full year of the Health Net business in our 2017 results, which operates at a higher SG&A expense ratio due to a greater mix of commercial and Medicare business.\nHealth Insurer Fee Expense\nAs a result of the health insurer fee moratorium, which suspended the health insurance provider fee for the 2017 calendar year, we did not recognize health insurer fee expense for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $461 million recognized for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOther Income (Expense)\nThe following table summarizes the components of other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, ($ in millions):\n\nThe increase in investment income in 2017 reflects higher interest rates and investment balances over 2016, as well as interest income from the State of Illinois related to capitation payment delays. Interest expense increased during the year ended December 31, 2017 by $38 million due to an increase in net borrowings, primarily related to the issuance of an additional $2.4 billion in senior notes in February 2016 in connection with the financing of the Health Net transaction.\nIncome Tax Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded income tax expense of $326 million on pre-tax earnings of $1.1 billion, or an effective tax rate of 28.7%. The effective tax rate reflects the effect of income tax reform and the health insurer fee moratorium. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded lower income tax expense of $125 million related to the provisional effect of the income tax rate reduction, primarily represented as a reduction to our deferred income tax liabilities. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded income tax expense of $599 million on pre-tax earnings of $1.2 billion, or an effective tax rate of 51.6%, which reflects the non-deductibility of the health insurer fee expense as well as the non-deductibility of certain acquisition related costs incurred in connection with the closing of our acquisition of Health Net.\nSegment Results\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated operating results by segment for the year ended December 31, ($ in millions):\n\nIn January 2017, we reclassified Cenpatico Behavioral Health of Arizona, LLC and the related Cenpatico Integrated Care health plan from the Specialty Services segment to the Managed Care segment due to a reorganization of the Arizona management structure following the Health Net integration. As a result, the financial results of Cenpatico Behavioral Health of Arizona, LLC and the related Cenpatico Integrated Care health plan have been reclassified from the Specialty Services segment to the Managed Care segment for all periods presented.\nManaged Care\nTotal revenues increased 19% in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the corresponding period in 2016, primarily as a result of a full year of the Health Net business in our 2017 results and growth, expansions or new programs in many of our states, particularly Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, and Texas, partially offset by the health insurer fee moratorium. Earnings from operations decreased $163 million between years primarily as a result of the $195 million of revenue recognized in 2016 relating to the minimum MLR change in California, the health insurer fee moratorium in 2017, and new or expanded health plans, which initially operate at a higher HBR and incur start-up costs. These drivers were partially offset by $214 million of lower acquisition related expenses and growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business.\nSpecialty Services\nTotal revenues increased 44% in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the corresponding period in 2016, resulting primarily from the a full year of the Health Net business in our 2017 results, the continued integration of Health Net into our specialty services, increased services associated with membership growth in the Managed Care segment, and growth in our correctional services and home-based primary care businesses. Earnings from operations increased $99 million between years primarily due to a full year of the Health Net business in our 2017 results.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nShown below is a condensed schedule of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, used in the discussion of liquidity and capital resources ($ in millions).\n\nCash Flows Provided by Operating Activities\nNormal operations are funded primarily through operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Cash flows from operating activities for 2018 were $1.2 billion, or 1.4 times net earnings, compared to $1.5 billion in 2017. The cash provided by operations in 2018 was primarily due to net earnings and an increase in medical claims liabilities, primarily resulting from growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business. Cash flows from operations were partially offset by an increase in premium and trade receivables of $1.2 billion, due to growth in the business. Additionally, cash flows from operations were negatively affected by the repayment of approximately $1.0 billion of Medicaid expansion rate overpayments and Medicaid expansion MLR rebates in California, which was previously accrued.\nCash flows from operating activities for 2017 was $1.5 billion, compared to $1.9 billion in 2016. Cash provided by operations in 2017 was primarily due to net earnings, an increase in medical claims liabilities resulting from growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business and the commencement of the Nebraska and Nevada health plans. Cash flows from operating activities for 2016 was $1.9 billion. Cash provided by operations in 2016 was primarily due to net earnings, an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and medical claims liabilities, and a decrease in other assets and premium and trade receivables. Additionally, cash provided by operations in 2016 was increased by approximately $445 million due to the timing of cash receipts shortly following the acquisition date.\nCash flows from operations in each year were impacted by the timing of payments we received from our states. States may prepay the following month premium payment, which we record as unearned revenue, or they may delay our premium payment, which we record as a receivable. We typically receive capitation payments monthly; however, the states in which we operate may decide to adjust their payment schedules which could positively or negatively impact our reported cash flows from operating activities in any given period.\n\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nInvesting activities used cash of $4.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, $1.3 billion in 2017, and $2.5 billion in 2016. Cash flows used in investing activities in 2018 primarily consisted of the Fidelis Care and other acquisitions, the net additions to the investment portfolio of our regulated subsidiaries (including transfers from cash and cash equivalents to long-term investments), the investments in RxAdvance, and capital expenditures.\nWe spent $675 million and $422 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, on capital expenditures for system enhancements and market and corporate headquarters expansions.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed-income securities with a weighted average duration of 3.3 years. We had unregulated cash and investments of $478 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $310 million at December 31, 2017. Unregulated cash and investments include private equity investments and company owned life insurance contracts.\nCash flows used in investing activities in 2017 primarily consisted of net additions to the investment portfolio of our regulated subsidiaries, including transfers from cash and cash equivalents to long-term investments, and capital expenditures.\nCash flows used in investing activities in 2016 primarily consisted of our acquisition of Health Net, net additions to the investment portfolio of our regulated subsidiaries, including transfers from cash and cash equivalents to long-term investments, and capital expenditures. In March 2016, we acquired Health Net for approximately $6.0 billion, including the assumption of $703 million of debt. The total consideration for the acquisition was $5.3 billion, consisting of Centene common shares valued at $3.0 billion, $2.2 billion in cash, and $2 million related to the fair value adjustment to stock based compensation associated with pre-combination service.\nCash Flows Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities\nOur financing activities provided cash of $4.6 billion in 2018, compared to using cash of $82 million in 2017 and providing cash of $2.7 billion in 2016, respectively. Financing activities in 2018, 2017 and 2016 are discussed below.\nDuring 2018, our net financing activities primarily related to our offering of $2.8 billion in shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, approximately $1.8 billion of 5.375% senior notes at par due 2026, and additional borrowings on our revolving credit agreement. Proceeds from both offerings were used to fund the Fidelis Care acquisition which closed on July 1, 2018, to pay related fees and expenses, and for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding indebtedness. Cash flows provided by financing activities were partially offset by common stock repurchases resulting from stock relinquished to us by employees for payment of taxes upon vesting of restricted stock units and the purchase of noncontrolling interest.\nDuring 2017, our net financing activities primarily related to common stock repurchases resulting from stock relinquished to us by employees for payment of taxes upon vesting of restricted stock units and the purchase of noncontrolling interest, partially offset by increased borrowings on our revolving credit agreement. In December 2017, we amended and increased our $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (Revolving Credit Facility) to $1.5 billion.\nDuring 2016, our financing activities primarily related to the proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in February 2016 associated with the Health Net acquisition, the issuance of additional senior notes in June 2016 and November 2016, partially offset by the redemption of our 5.75% senior notes due 2017, the redemption of our 6.375% senior notes due 2017, and the repayment of amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility.\nIn February 2016, our wholly owned unrestricted subsidiary (Escrow Issuer) issued $1.4 billion of 5.625% senior notes ($1.4 Billion Notes) at par due 2021 and $1.0 billion of 6.125% senior notes ($1.0 Billion Notes) at par due 2024. We used the net proceeds of the offering, together with borrowings under the our new $1.0 billion revolving credit facility and cash on hand, to fund the cash consideration for the Health Net acquisition and to pay acquisition and offering related fees and expenses. In connection with the February 2016 issuance, we entered into interest rate swap agreements for notional amounts of $600 million and $1.0 billion, at floating rates of interest based on the three month LIBOR plus 4.22% and the three month LIBOR plus 4.44%, respectively. Gains and losses due to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps completely offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt and are recorded as an adjustment to the $1.4 Billion Notes and $1.0 Billion Notes.\nIn connection with the closing of the Health Net acquisition on March 24, 2016, our then-existing unsecured $500 million revolving credit facility was terminated and simultaneously replaced with the Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under the agreement bear interest based upon LIBOR rates, the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate.\nIn June 2016, we issued an additional $500 million of 4.75% senior notes due 2022 at a premium to yield 4.41% ($500 Million Add-on Notes). The $500 Million Add-on Notes were offered as additional debt securities under the indenture governing the $500 million of 4.75% senior notes issued April 2014. We used the net proceeds of the offering to repay amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility and to pay offering related fees and expenses.\nIn November 2016, we issued $1.2 billion of 4.75% senior notes due 2025 ($1.2 Billion Notes). We used the net proceeds to redeem our $425 million of 5.75% senior notes due 2017 and Health Net's $400 million of 6.375% senior notes due 2017, to repay amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility, to pay related fees and expenses and for general purposes.\nLiquidity Metrics\nThe credit agreement underlying our Revolving Credit Facility contains non-financial and financial covenants, including requirements of minimum fixed charge coverage ratios and maximum debt-to-EBITDA ratios. We are required to not exceed a maximum debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.5 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2018, we had $284 million in borrowings outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility, and we were in compliance with all covenants. As of December 31, 2018, there were no limitations on the availability under the revolving credit agreement as a result of the debt-to-EBITDA ratio.\nWe have a $200 million non-recourse construction loan to fund the expansion of our corporate headquarters. The loan bears interest based on the one month LIBOR plus 2.70% and matures in April 2021 with an optional one-year extension. The agreement contains financial and non-financial covenants aligning with our revolving credit agreement. We have guaranteed completion of the construction project associated with the loan. As of December 31, 2018, we had $63 million of borrowings outstanding under the loan.\nWe had outstanding letters of credit of $56 million as of December 31, 2018, which were not part of our revolving credit facility. We also had letters of credit for $27 million (valued at the December 31, 2018 conversion rate), or \u20ac24 million, representing our proportional share of the letters of credit issued to support Ribera Salud's outstanding debt which are a part of the revolving credit facility. Collectively, the letters of credit bore weighted interest of 0.99% as of December 31, 2018. In addition, we had outstanding surety bonds of $496 million as of December 31, 2018.\nThe indentures governing our various maturities of senior notes contain non-financial and financial covenants of Centene Corporation, including requirements of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants.\nAs discussed above, in May 2018, we issued approximately $2.8 billion of new equity, and approximately $1.8 billion of 5.375% senior notes at par due 2026. Proceeds from the offerings were used to fund the Fidelis Care acquisition which closed on July 1, 2018, to pay related fees and expenses, and for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding indebtedness.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, of $27 million, compared to negative $629 million at December 31, 2017. We manage our short-term and long-term investments with the goal of ensuring that a sufficient portion is held in investments that are highly liquid and can be sold to fund short-term requirements as needed.\nAt December 31, 2018, our debt to capital ratio, defined as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and total equity, was 37.8%, compared to 40.6% at December 31, 2017. Excluding the $120 million non-recourse mortgage note and construction loan, our debt to capital ratio was 37.4% as of December 31, 2018, compared to 40.3% at December 31, 2017. We utilize the debt to capital ratio as a measure, among others, of our leverage and financial flexibility.\nWe have a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to 16 million shares of common stock from time to time on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. We have 7 million available shares remaining under the program for repurchases as of December 31, 2018. No duration has been placed on the repurchase program. We reserve the right to discontinue the repurchase program at any time. We did not make any repurchases under this plan during 2018, 2017 or 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we received dividends of $475 million, $312 million, and $121 million, respectively, from our regulated subsidiaries.\n2019 Expectations\nDuring 2019, we expect to make net capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries of approximately $327 million associated with our growth and spend approximately $650 million in additional capital expenditures primarily associated with system enhancements and market and corporate headquarters expansions. These amounts are expected to be funded by unregulated cash flow generation and borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility and construction loan. However, from time to time we may elect to raise additional funds for these and other purposes, either through issuance of debt or equity, the sale of investment securities or otherwise, as appropriate. In addition, we may strategically pursue refinancing opportunities to extend maturities and/or improve terms of our indebtedness if we believe such opportunities are favorable to us.\nBased on our operating plan, we expect that our available cash, cash equivalents and investments, cash from our operations and cash available under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our general operations and capital expenditures for at least 12 months from the date of this filing.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe following table summarizes future contractual obligations. These obligations contain estimates and are subject to revision under a number of circumstances. Our debt consists of borrowings from our senior notes, Revolving Credit Facility, mortgages and capital leases. The purchase obligations consist primarily of software purchases and maintenance contracts. The contractual obligations and estimated period of payment over the next five years and beyond are as follows ($ in millions):\n ", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this filing. The discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including those set forth under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nGeneral\nWe are a diversified, multi-national healthcare enterprise that provides services to government sponsored and commercial healthcare programs, focusing on under-insured and uninsured individuals. We provide member-focused services through locally based staff by assisting in accessing care, coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions.\nResults of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits (including estimated costs incurred) and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs. We measure operating performance based upon two key ratios. The health benefits ratio (HBR) represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues, excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues that are separately billed, and reflects the direct relationship between the premiums received and the medical services provided. The SG&A expense ratio represents SG&A costs as a percentage of premium and service revenues, excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues that are separately billed.\nOn December 12, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a two-for-one split of our common stock in the form of a 100% stock dividend distributed on February 6, 2019 to stockholders of record as of December 24, 2018. All share, per share and stock price information presented in this Form 10-K has been adjusted for the two-for-one stock split.\nFidelis Care Acquisition\nOn July 1, 2018, we acquired substantially all of the assets of New York State Catholic Health Plan, Inc., d/b/a Fidelis Care New York (Fidelis Care) for approximately $3.6 billion of cash consideration, which includes a working capital adjustment. The cash consideration was funded through approximately $2.8 billion of new equity, and approximately $1.8 billion of new long-term debt. Both offerings were completed in May 2018. The Fidelis Care Acquisition expanded our health plan footprint to New York State. As a result of the completion of the Fidelis Care Acquisition, our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 include the results of operations of Fidelis Care from July 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018. Due to the size of the acquisition, one of the primary drivers of the year-over-year variances discussed throughout this section is related to the Fidelis Care Acquisition.\nAs part of the regulatory approval process in connection with the Fidelis Care Acquisition, we entered into certain undertakings with the New York State Department of Health. These undertakings contain various commitments by us effective upon completion of the Fidelis Care Acquisition. One of the undertakings includes a $340 million contribution by us to the State of New York to be paid over a five-year period for initiatives consistent with our mission of providing high quality healthcare to vulnerable populations within New York State. The present value of the $340 million contribution to the State of New York, approximately $328 million, was expensed during 2018.\nAcquisitions and Investments\nWe continued to execute on our growth strategy through acquisitions and investments during 2018. In the first quarter of 2018, we acquired Community Medical Holdings Corp., d/b/a Community Medical Group (CMG), an at-risk primary care provider serving Medicaid, Medicare Advantage, and Health Insurance Marketplace patients in Miami-Dade County, Florida. CMG has a multi-payor strategy and serves members of our Florida health plan. The acquisition increases our scale and capabilities and creates a vertical integration opportunity with providers. In the first quarter of 2018, we also acquired an additional 61% ownership in Interpreta Holdings, Inc. (Interpreta), a clinical and genomics data analytics business, bringing our total ownership to 80%. In the first and second quarters of 2018, we completed a 28% equity method investment in RxAdvance (RxA), a full-service pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) with an innovative technology platform. In the third quarter of 2018, we made an additional investment in RxA in the form of convertible preferred stock. Both the Interpreta and RxA transactions reflect our commitment to technological innovation and providing comprehensive and integrated specialty services.\nIn the second quarter of 2018, we acquired MHM Services Inc. (MHM), a provider of behavioral health, medical and dental services to correctional facilities, state hospitals, courts, juvenile facilities and community clinics. Under the terms of the agreement, we also acquired the remaining 49% ownership of Centurion, the correctional healthcare services joint venture between MHM and us, expanding our national footprint in the correctional healthcare sector.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, our Spanish subsidiary, Primero Salud, acquired 89% of Torrej\u00f3n Salud, the concessionaire of the University Hospital of Torrej\u00f3n de Ardoz in the Community of Madrid, expanding our presence in Spain.\nRegulatory Trends and Uncertainties\nIn December 2018, a federal district judge in Texas ruled that the entire Affordable Care Act (ACA) is unconstitutional in the case of Texas v. United States of America.\u201d The case centers on the argument that the law's individual mandate requirement was essential to the ACA, and without it, the remainder of the ACA was invalid. The Company remains focused on the promise of delivering access to quality, affordable healthcare to all of its members, following the District Court decision regarding the constitutionality of the ACA. The ACA will remain in its current form for 2019.

This partnership includes both a customer relationship and a strategic investment in RxAdvance. As part of the initial transaction, Centene has certain rights to expand its equity investment in the future. In May 2018, we made an additional investment in RxAdvance, bringing the total ownership to 28%. In September 2018, we made an additional investment in convertible preferred stock. In 2018, we began moving our health plans onto the RxAdvance pharmacy platform, beginning with the transition of our Mississippi health plan in December 2018. \n \u2022 Washington. In January 2018, our Washington State subsidiary, Coordinated Care of Washington, began providing managed care services to Apple Health's Fully Integrated Managed Care beneficiaries in the North Central Region. \n \u2022 In addition, we realized the full year benefit in 2017 of acquisitions, investments, and business commenced during 2016, including the March 2016 acquisition of Health Net for $6.0 billion, including the assumption of debt. \nThe growth items listed above were partially offset by the following items:\n \u2022 We were successful in reprocuring our contracts in Georgia, Indiana, and Mississippi. However, the Medicaid programs were expanded to include additional insurers, which has reduced our market share. In addition, we are no longer serving LTSS members in Arizona or Medicaid and correctional members in Massachusetts. \n \u2022 Beginning in January 2018, the State of California no longer includes costs for IHSS in its Medicaid contracts. \n \u2022 Effective October 2018, we no longer provide health care coordination services to veterans under the Patient-Centered Community Care and Veterans Choice Programs. \nWe expect the following items to contribute to our revenue or future growth potential:\n \u2022 We expect to realize the full year benefit in 2019 of acquisitions, investments, and business commenced during 2018, as discussed above. \n \u2022 In February 2019, our North Carolina joint venture, Carolina Complete Health, was awarded a contract for the Medicaid Managed Care program.

Our Star ratings returned to a 4.0 Star parent rating. The 2019 rating year will positively affect quality bonus payments for Medicare Advantage plans in 2020. \n \u2022 In July 2018, we announced a joint venture with Ascension to establish a Medicare Advantage plan. The plan is expected to be implemented in multiple geographic markets beginning in 2020. \n \u2022 In July 2018, our subsidiary, Health Net Federal Services, was awarded the next generation Military & Family Life Counseling Program contract. The awarded contract is up to ten years, including multiple one-year option periods. \n \u2022 In July 2018, Centurion began operating under a contract to provide healthcare services for correctional facilities in Pima County, Arizona. In addition, Centurion's contracts for correctional facilities were reprocured in Florida, New Hampshire and Tennessee. \n \u2022 In May 2018, our Iowa subsidiary, Iowa Total Care, Inc., was selected to negotiate a new statewide contract for the IA Health Link Program. The contract is expected to commence on July 1, 2019. \nThe future growth items listed above are partially offset by the following item:\n \u2022 In the first quarter of 2018, Health Net of Arizona, Inc. notified the Arizona Department of Insurance of its decision to discontinue and non-renew all of its Employer Group plans for small and large business groups in Arizona beginning January 1, 2019. The effective date of coverage termination for existing groups is dependent on remaining renewals; however, coverage will no longer be provided to any group policyholders and/or members after December 31, 2019. \n \u2022 We were successful in reprocuring our contract in Washington. However, we expect market share to decrease as a result of the award. \nMEMBERSHIP\nFrom December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2018, we increased our managed care membership by 2.6 million, or 23%.

our Health Insurance Marketplace service areas. \nThese increases were partially offset by a net decrease in our behavioral health membership as many states are combining these services within our physical health contracts in order to integrate physical and behavioral health care to achieve a more holistic care model for our members.\nFrom December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, our membership increased as a result of:\n \u2022 membership growth in our Health Insurance Marketplace service areas; \n \u2022 the commencement of health plan management services for Medicaid operations in Maryland; \n \u2022 an expanded statewide managed care contract in Missouri; and \n \u2022 the commencement of new managed care contracts in Nebraska and Nevada. \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following

Needs Plans, and MMP.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenues increased 24% in the year ended December 31, 2018, over the corresponding period in 2017, primarily due to the acquisition of Fidelis Care, growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business, expansions and new programs in many of our states, and the reinstatement of the health insurer fee in 2018. This was partially offset by lower revenues as a result of the removal of the IHSS program from California's Medicaid contract in January 2018. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, we received Medicaid premium rate adjustments which yielded a net 1% composite change across all of our markets.\nOperating Expenses\nMedical Costs\nResults of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits and to accurately estimate costs incurred. The HBR represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues, excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues that are separately billed, and reflects the direct relationship between the premiums received and the medical services provided.\nThe HBR for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 85.9%, a decrease of 140 basis points over the comparable period in 2017. The HBR decrease compared to last year was driven by membership growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business, the reinstatement of the health insurer fee in 2018, and the recognition of the previously mentioned IHSS program reconciliation. This was partially offset by the acquisition of Fidelis Care, which operates at a higher HBR.\nCost of Services\nCost of services increased by $539 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period in 2017. This was primarily due to the acquisition of Foundation Care in October 2017 and growth in our correctional services business, including the acquisition of MHM.\nThe cost of service ratio for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 85.0%, compared to 81.5% in 2017. The cost of service ratio was negatively impacted by approximately 110 basis points for the costs associated with the Veterans Affairs contract expiration. The increase in the cost of service ratio was also due to lower margins associated with our other federal services business and growth in our specialty pharmacy business due to the acquisition of Foundation Care in October 2017, which operates at a higher cost of service ratio. These increases were partially offset by growth in our correctional services business resulting from the acquisition of MHM, which operates at a lower cost of service ratio.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A increased by $1.6 billion in the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period in 2017. This was primarily due to the acquisition of Fidelis Care, including acquisition related expenses, costs associated with the previously mentioned Veterans Affairs contract expiration, and expansions, new programs and growth in many of our states in 2018, including growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business. These increases were partially offset by the $56 million recognized during 2017 for our estimated share of the undiscounted guaranty association assessment resulting from the liquidation of Penn Treaty.\nThe SG&A expense ratio was 10.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 9.7% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to increased acquisition related expenses. The Adjusted SG&A expense ratio was 10.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 9.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The SG&A and Adjusted SG&A expense ratios both increased due to growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business and the impact of the removal of the IHSS program from California's Medicaid contract in January 2018. These increases in both ratios were partially offset by the acquisition of Fidelis Care.\nHealth Insurer Fee Expense\nHealth insurance fee expense was $709 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. As a result of the health insurer fee moratorium, which suspended the health insurance provider fee for the 2017 calendar year, we did not record health insurer fee expense for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOther Income (Expense)\nThe following table summarizes the components of other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, ($ in millions):\nTable 231: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment and other income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>190\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(343\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(255\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(90\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(65\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in investment income in 2018 reflects higher interest rates and investment balances over 2017, including the impact of higher investment balances as a result of organic portfolio growth and the Fidelis Care acquisition. These increases were partially offset by 2017 interest income from the State of Illinois related to capitation payment delays. Interest expense increased by $88 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period in 2017, reflecting a net increase in borrowings, primarily related to the financing of the Fidelis Care acquisition and the effect of our interest rate swaps.\nIncome Tax Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded income tax expense of $474 million on pre-tax earnings of $1.4 billion, or an effective tax rate of 34.6%. The effective tax rate reflects the lower corporate tax rate as enacted in the TCJA, partially offset by an increased tax rate due to the non-deductibility of the health insurer fee. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded income tax expense of $326 million on pre-tax earnings of $1.1 billion, or an effective tax rate of 28.7%, which reflects the higher corporate tax rate for 2017, the one-time effects of the TCJA, and the impact of the health insurer fee moratorium.\nSegment Results\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated operating results by segment for the year ended December 31, ($ in millions):\nTable 232: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n2017-2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Managed Care\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specialty Services\n</td> <td>12,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Eliminations\n</td> <td>(9,489\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,515\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from Operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Managed Care\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specialty Services\n</td> <td>148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManaged Care\nTotal revenues increased 25% in the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period in 2017, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Fidelis Care and expansions, new programs, and growth in many of our states, particularly Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and Texas, including growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business. Total revenues also increased as a result of the reinstatement of the health insurer fee in 2018. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the removal of the IHSS program from California's Medicaid contract in January 2018 and a reduction in pass through payments from the State of California in 2018 compared to 2017. Earnings from operations increased $393 million between years primarily as a result of the acquisition of Fidelis Care, growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business, and the reinstatement of the health insurer fee in 2018, partially offset by increased acquisition related expenses. In addition, 2017 was negatively impacted by the Penn Treaty assessment expense.\nSpecialty Services\nTotal revenues increased 4% in the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period in 2017, resulting primarily from increased services associated with membership growth in the Managed Care segment and acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by a decline in revenue for our behavioral health services business as a result of many states combining these services within our physical health contracts in order to integrate physical and behavioral health care to achieve a more holistic care model for our members. Earnings from operations decreased $134 million between years primarily due to costs associated with the previously mentioned Veterans Affairs contract expiration and lower margins in our other federal services and behavioral health services businesses, partially offset by growth in our pharmacy benefits management business.\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2019, we expect lower earnings in our Specialty Services segment and corresponding higher earnings in our Managed Care segment as we move to transparent pharmacy pricing. This reflects our commitment to transparency and more closely aligns the costs of care within each segment. It also aligns with our continued transition to the next generation RxAdvance pharmacy platform during 2019 and 2020.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nTotal Revenues\nTable 233: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change 2016-2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medicaid\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>8,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medicare (1)\n</td> <td>4,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>2,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,803\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Medicare includes Medicare Advantage, Medicare Supplement, Special Needs Plans, and MMP.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenues increased 19% in the year ended December 31, 2017, over the corresponding period in 2016, primarily as a result of a full year of Health Net's results, as well as the impact of growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business in 2017 and expansions and new programs in many of our states in 2016 and 2017. This was partially offset by the moratorium of the health insurer fee in 2017, lower membership in the commercial business in California as a result of margin improvement actions taken in 2016, and lower specialty pharmacy revenues. As a result of the health insurer fee moratorium, which suspended the health insurance provider fee for the 2017 calendar year, we did not recognize health insurer fee revenue in 2017, compared to $531 million recognized in 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we received Medicaid premium rate adjustments which yielded an approximate net 1% composite rate change across all of our markets.\nOperating Expenses\nMedical Costs\nThe HBR for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 87.3%, an increase of 80 basis points over the comparable period in 2016. The increase compared to last year was primarily a result of the $195 million of revenue recognized in 2016 relating to the minimum MLR change in California, which reduced the 2016 HBR by 50 basis points, a premium rate reduction for California Medicaid Expansion effective July 1, 2017, an increase in flu related costs over 2016, and the impact of new or expanded health plans, which initially operate at a higher HBR. These increases were partially offset by growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business, which operates at a lower HBR.\nCost of Services\nCost of services decreased by $17 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the corresponding period in 2016. This was primarily due to lower specialty pharmacy sales and decreased costs associated with our federal services business, partially offset by growth in our correctional business. The cost of service ratio for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 81.5%, compared to 85.5% in 2016. The decrease in the cost of service ratio is primarily due to decreased costs associated with our federal services business and the results of the shared savings programs in our home-based primary care business.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A increased by $773 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the corresponding period in 2016. This was primarily a result of:\n \u2022 a full year of the Health Net business in our 2017 results; \n \u2022 the impact of new programs in many of our states in 2016 and 2017; \n \u2022 higher business expansion costs; \n \u2022 additional expense recognized for our estimated share of the undiscounted guaranty association assessment resulting from the liquidation of Penn Treaty; and \n \u2022 higher variable compensation expenses based on the performance of the business in 2017. \nThe increases above are partially offset by a decrease in acquisition related expenses of $214 million.\nThe SG&A expense ratio was 9.7% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 9.8% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in the SG&A expense ratio was primarily attributable to lower acquisition related expenses, partially offset by higher business expansion costs over 2016, the Penn Treaty assessment and our results including a full year of the Health Net business, which operates at a higher SG&A expense ratio due to a greater mix of commercial and Medicare business.\nThe Adjusted SG&A expense ratio was 9.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 9.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in the Adjusted SG&A expense ratio was primarily attributable to higher business expansion costs over 2016 and a full year of the Health Net business in our 2017 results, which operates at a higher SG&A expense ratio due to a greater mix of commercial and Medicare business.\nHealth Insurer Fee Expense\nAs a result of the health insurer fee moratorium, which suspended the health insurance provider fee for the 2017 calendar year, we did not recognize health insurer fee expense for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $461 million recognized for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOther Income (Expense)\nThe following table summarizes the components of other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, ($ in millions):\nTable 239: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment and other income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(255\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(217\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(65\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(103\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in investment income in 2017 reflects higher interest rates and investment balances over 2016, as well as interest income from the State of Illinois related to capitation payment delays. Interest expense increased during the year ended December 31, 2017 by $38 million due to an increase in net borrowings, primarily related to the issuance of an additional $2.4 billion in senior notes in February 2016 in connection with the financing of the Health Net transaction.\nIncome Tax Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded income tax expense of $326 million on pre-tax earnings of $1.1 billion, or an effective tax rate of 28.7%. The effective tax rate reflects the effect of income tax reform and the health insurer fee moratorium. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded lower income tax expense of $125 million related to the provisional effect of the income tax rate reduction, primarily represented as a reduction to our deferred income tax liabilities. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded income tax expense of $599 million on pre-tax earnings of $1.2 billion, or an effective tax rate of 51.6%, which reflects the non-deductibility of the health insurer fee expense as well as the non-deductibility of certain acquisition related costs incurred in connection with the closing of our acquisition of Health Net.\nSegment Results\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated operating results by segment for the year ended December 31, ($ in millions):\nTable 240: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n2016-2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Managed Care\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specialty Services\n</td> <td>12,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Eliminations\n</td> <td>(9,515\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,152\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(55\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from Operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Managed Care\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specialty Services\n</td> <td>282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn January 2017, we reclassified Cenpatico Behavioral Health of Arizona, LLC and the related Cenpatico Integrated Care health plan from the Specialty Services segment to the Managed Care segment due to a reorganization of the Arizona management structure following the Health Net integration. As a result, the financial results of Cenpatico Behavioral Health of Arizona, LLC and the related Cenpatico Integrated Care health plan have been reclassified from the Specialty Services segment to the Managed Care segment for all periods presented.\nManaged Care\nTotal revenues increased 19% in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the corresponding period in 2016, primarily as a result of a full year of the Health Net business in our 2017 results and growth, expansions or new programs in many of our states, particularly Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, and Texas, partially offset by the health insurer fee moratorium. Earnings from operations decreased $163 million between years primarily as a result of the $195 million of revenue recognized in 2016 relating to the minimum MLR change in California, the health insurer fee moratorium in 2017, and new or expanded health plans, which initially operate at a higher HBR and incur start-up costs. These drivers were partially offset by $214 million of lower acquisition related expenses and growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business.\nSpecialty Services\nTotal revenues increased 44% in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the corresponding period in 2016, resulting primarily from the a full year of the Health Net business in our 2017 results, the continued integration of Health Net into our specialty services, increased services associated with membership growth in the Managed Care segment, and growth in our correctional services and home-based primary care businesses. Earnings from operations increased $99 million between years primarily due to a full year of the Health Net business in our 2017 results.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nShown below is a condensed schedule of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, used in the discussion of liquidity and capital resources ($ in millions).\nTable 241: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(4,585\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,254\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,469\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>4,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(82\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows Provided by Operating Activities\nNormal operations are funded primarily through operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.

The cash provided by operations in 2018 was primarily due to net earnings and an increase in medical claims liabilities, primarily resulting from growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business. Cash flows from operations were partially offset by an increase in premium and trade receivables of $1.2 billion, due to growth in the business. Additionally, cash flows from operations were negatively affected by the repayment of approximately $1.0 billion of Medicaid expansion rate overpayments and Medicaid expansion MLR rebates in California, which was previously accrued.\nCash flows from operating activities for 2017 was $1.5 billion, compared to $1.9 billion in 2016. Cash provided by operations in 2017 was primarily due to net earnings, an increase in medical claims liabilities resulting from growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business and the commencement of the Nebraska and Nevada health plans. Cash flows from operating activities for 2016 was $1.9 billion. Cash provided by operations in 2016 was primarily due to net earnings, an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and medical claims liabilities, and a decrease in other assets and premium and trade receivables. Additionally, cash provided by operations in 2016 was increased by approximately $445 million due to the timing of cash receipts shortly following the acquisition date.\nCash flows from operations in each year were impacted by the timing of payments we received from our states. States may prepay the following month premium payment, which we record as unearned revenue, or they may delay our premium payment, which we record as a receivable. We typically receive capitation payments monthly; however, the states in which we operate may decide to adjust their payment schedules which could positively or negatively impact our reported cash flows from operating activities in any given period.\nTable 242: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Increase) decrease in premium and trade receivables\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,173\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(50\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in unearned revenue\n</td> <td>(52\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in operating cash flow\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,225\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(31\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>117\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nInvesting activities used cash of $4.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, $1.3 billion in 2017, and $2.5 billion in 2016. Cash flows used in investing activities in 2018 primarily consisted of the Fidelis Care and other acquisitions, the net additions to the investment portfolio of our regulated subsidiaries (including transfers from cash and cash equivalents to long-term investments), the investments in RxAdvance, and capital expenditures.\nWe spent $675 million and $422 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, on capital expenditures for system enhancements and market and corporate headquarters expansions.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed-income securities with a weighted average duration of 3.3 years. We had unregulated cash and investments of $478 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $310 million at December 31, 2017. Unregulated cash and investments include private equity investments and company owned life insurance contracts.\nCash flows used in investing activities in 2017 primarily consisted of net additions to the investment portfolio of our regulated subsidiaries, including transfers from cash and cash equivalents to long-term investments, and capital expenditures.\nCash flows used in investing activities in 2016 primarily consisted of our acquisition of Health Net, net additions to the investment portfolio of our regulated subsidiaries, including transfers from cash and cash equivalents to long-term investments, and capital expenditures. In March 2016, we acquired Health Net for approximately $6.0 billion, including the assumption of $703 million of debt. The total consideration for the acquisition was $5.3 billion, consisting of Centene common shares valued at $3.0 billion, $2.2 billion in cash, and $2 million related to the fair value adjustment to stock based compensation associated with pre-combination service.\nCash Flows Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities\nOur financing activities provided cash of $4.6 billion in 2018, compared to using cash of $82 million in 2017 and providing cash of $2.7 billion in 2016, respectively. Financing activities in 2018, 2017 and 2016 are discussed below.\nDuring 2018, our net financing activities primarily related to our offering of $2.8 billion in shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, approximately $1.8 billion of 5.375% senior notes at par due 2026, and additional borrowings on our revolving credit agreement. Proceeds from both offerings were used to fund the Fidelis Care acquisition which closed on July 1, 2018, to pay related fees and expenses, and for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding indebtedness. Cash flows provided by financing activities were partially offset by common stock repurchases resulting from stock relinquished to us by employees for payment of taxes upon vesting of restricted stock units and the purchase of noncontrolling interest.\nDuring 2017, our net financing activities primarily related to common stock repurchases resulting from stock relinquished to us by employees for payment of taxes upon vesting of restricted stock units and the purchase of noncontrolling interest, partially offset by increased borrowings on our revolving credit agreement. In December 2017, we amended and increased our $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (Revolving Credit Facility) to $1.5 billion.\nDuring 2016, our financing activities primarily related to the proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in February 2016 associated with the Health Net acquisition, the issuance of additional senior notes in June 2016 and November 2016, partially offset by the redemption of our 5.75% senior notes due 2017, the redemption of our 6.375% senior notes due 2017, and the repayment of amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility.\nIn February 2016, our wholly owned unrestricted subsidiary (Escrow Issuer) issued $1.4 billion of 5.625% senior notes ($1.4 Billion Notes) at par due 2021 and $1.0 billion of 6.125% senior notes ($1.0 Billion Notes) at par due 2024. We used the net proceeds of the offering, together with borrowings under the our new $1.0 billion revolving credit facility and cash on hand, to fund the cash consideration for the Health Net acquisition and to pay acquisition and offering related fees and expenses. In connection with the February 2016 issuance, we entered into interest rate swap agreements for notional amounts of $600 million and $1.0 billion, at floating rates of interest based on the three month LIBOR plus 4.22% and the three month LIBOR plus 4.44%, respectively. Gains and losses due to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps completely offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt and are recorded as an adjustment to the $1.4 Billion Notes and $1.0 Billion Notes.\nIn connection with the closing of the Health Net acquisition on March 24, 2016, our then-existing unsecured $500 million revolving credit facility was terminated and simultaneously replaced with the Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under the agreement bear interest based upon LIBOR rates, the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate.\nIn June 2016, we issued an additional $500 million of 4.75% senior notes due 2022 at a premium to yield 4.41% ($500 Million Add-on Notes). The $500 Million Add-on Notes were offered as additional debt securities under the indenture governing the $500 million of 4.75% senior notes issued April 2014. We used the net proceeds of the offering to repay amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility and to pay offering related fees and expenses.\nIn November 2016, we issued $1.2 billion of 4.75% senior notes due 2025 ($1.2 Billion Notes). We used the net proceeds to redeem our $425 million of 5.75% senior notes due 2017 and Health Net's $400 million of 6.375% senior notes due 2017, to repay amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility, to pay related fees and expenses and for general purposes.\nLiquidity Metrics\nThe credit agreement underlying our Revolving Credit Facility contains non-financial and financial covenants, including requirements of minimum fixed charge coverage ratios and maximum debt-to-EBITDA ratios. We are required to not exceed a maximum debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.5 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2018, we had $284 million in borrowings outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility, and we were in compliance with all covenants. As of December 31, 2018, there were no limitations on the availability under the revolving credit agreement as a result of the debt-to-EBITDA ratio.\nWe have a $200 million non-recourse construction loan to fund the expansion of our corporate headquarters. The loan bears interest based on the one month LIBOR plus 2.70% and matures in April 2021 with an optional one-year extension. The agreement contains financial and non-financial covenants aligning with our revolving credit agreement. We have guaranteed completion of the construction project associated with the loan. As of December 31, 2018, we had $63 million of borrowings outstanding under the loan.\nWe had outstanding letters of credit of $56 million as of December 31, 2018, which were not part of our revolving credit facility. We also had letters of credit for $27 million (valued at the December 31, 2018 conversion rate), or \u20ac24 million, representing our proportional share of the letters of credit issued to support Ribera Salud's outstanding debt which are a part of the revolving credit facility. Collectively, the letters of credit bore weighted interest of 0.99% as of December 31, 2018. In addition, we had outstanding surety bonds of $496 million as of December 31, 2018.\nThe indentures governing our various maturities of senior notes contain non-financial and financial covenants of Centene Corporation, including requirements of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants.\nAs discussed above, in May 2018, we issued approximately $2.8 billion of new equity, and approximately $1.8 billion of 5.375% senior notes at par due 2026. Proceeds from the offerings were used to fund the Fidelis Care acquisition which closed on July 1, 2018, to pay related fees and expenses, and for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding indebtedness.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, of $27 million, compared to negative $629 million at December 31, 2017. We manage our short-term and long-term investments with the goal of ensuring that a sufficient portion is held in investments that are highly liquid and can be sold to fund short-term requirements as needed.\nAt December 31, 2018, our debt to capital ratio, defined as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and total equity, was 37.8%, compared to 40.6% at December 31, 2017. Excluding the $120 million non-recourse mortgage note and construction loan, our debt to capital ratio was 37.4% as of December 31, 2018, compared to 40.3% at December 31, 2017. We utilize the debt to capital ratio as a measure, among others, of our leverage and financial flexibility.\nWe have a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to 16 million shares of common stock from time to time on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. We have 7 million available shares remaining under the program for repurchases as of December 31, 2018. No duration has been placed on the repurchase program. We reserve the right to discontinue the repurchase program at any time. We did not make any repurchases under this plan during 2018, 2017 or 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we received dividends of $475 million, $312 million, and $121 million, respectively, from our regulated subsidiaries.\n2019 Expectations\nDuring 2019, we expect to make net capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries of approximately $327 million associated with our growth and spend approximately $650 million in additional capital expenditures primarily associated with system enhancements and market and corporate headquarters expansions. These amounts are expected to be funded by unregulated cash flow generation and borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility and construction loan. However, from time to time we may elect to raise additional funds for these and other purposes, either through issuance of debt or equity, the sale of investment securities or otherwise, as appropriate. In addition, we may strategically pursue refinancing opportunities to extend maturities and/or improve terms of our indebtedness if we believe such opportunities are favorable to us.\nBased on our operating plan, we expect that our available cash, cash equivalents and investments, cash from our operations and cash available under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our general operations and capital expenditures for at least 12 months from the date of this filing.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe following table summarizes future contractual obligations. These obligations contain estimates and are subject to revision under a number of circumstances. Our debt consists of borrowings from our senior notes, Revolving Credit Facility, mortgages and capital leases. The purchase obligations consist primarily of software purchases and maintenance contracts. The contractual obligations and estimated period of payment over the next five years and beyond are as follows ($ in millions):\n "}
