MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOverview\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand the Company and its operations. This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections of future events. However, our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein as a result of the risks that we face, including but not limited to those risks stated in the \"Risk Factors\" section of this report. See \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\" above. In addition, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.\nYear in Review\n2016 Financial Highlights\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Operating income decreased to $395 million compared to $426 million in the prior-year period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Pre-tax income grew to $379 million compared to $296 million in the prior-year period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>GAAP net income of $235 million or $4.36 per diluted share compared to $183 million or $2.98 per diluted share in the prior year period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Adjusted net income of $280 million or $5.19 per diluted share compared to $189 million or $3.09 per share in the prior year period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $610 million compared to $560 million in the prior year period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Extinguished $141 million of debt instruments that were originally scheduled to mature in 2022 and 2023.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for our reconciliation of non-GAAP measures.\nOutlook\nWe expect our financial performance to remain strong in the first quarter of 2017, as compared to the first quarter of 2016. We expect our passenger revenues to increase, coupled with expected increases in our aircraft fuel, wages and benefits, and rent expense which could potentially put pressure on our operating margins (as compared to 2016). We expect available seat miles during the first quarter of 2017 to increase by 2.5% to 4.5% from the same prior year period. Despite the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, a decrease in fuel surcharges on our international routes, and an increase in industry capacity on our Neighbor Island routes, operating revenue per available seat mile could increase by up to 4.0% to 7.0% from the same prior year period.\nThe table below is a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP CASM ex-fuel guidance for the first quarter of 2017.\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated three months ending March 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except as otherwise indicated)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>511,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>539,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: aircraft fuel, including taxes and delivery\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100,235\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(108,248\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted operating expenses - excluding aircraft fuel\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>411,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>431,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Available Seat Miles\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,477,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,564,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CASM - GAAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.43\n</td> <td>\u00a2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.83\n</td> <td>\u00a2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: aircraft fuel\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.24\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.37\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CASM - excluding aircraft fuel\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.19\n</td> <td>\u00a2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.46\n</td> <td>\u00a2\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelected Consolidated Statistical Data\nBelow are the operating statistics we use to measure our operating performance.

Revenue is recognized when either the transportation is provided or when the related ticket expires unused. We measure capacity in terms of available seat miles, which represent the number of seats available for passengers multiplied by the number of miles the seats are flown. Yield, or the average amount one passenger pays to fly one mile, is calculated by dividing passenger revenue by RPMs. We strive to increase passenger revenue primarily by increasing our yield per flight or by filling a higher proportion of available seats, which produces higher operating revenue per available seat mile. Other revenue primarily consists of baggage fees, cargo revenue, incidental services revenue, ticket change and cancellation fees, marketing component related to the sale of frequent flyer miles, inflight revenue, contract services and charter services revenue.\nOperating revenue was $2.45 billion, $2.32 billion and $2.31 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The increase in operating revenue in 2016 from 2015 was driven primarily by an increase in passenger revenue and is discussed below:\n2016 vs. 2015\nPassenger Revenue\nPassenger revenue was $2.15 billion and $2.03 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Details of these changes are described in the table below: Table 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2016 as compared to December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Change in scheduled passenger revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in\nYield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in\nRPM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in\nASM\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>104.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International\n</td> <td>15.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total scheduled\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDomestic revenue increased by $104.2 million in 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to capacity, yield, and load factor increases on our North America routes; along with increases in capacity on our Neighbor Island routes.\nInternational revenue increased by $15.9 million in 2016, as compared to 2015, due to increased capacity. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar combined with lower fuel surcharges resulted in decreased average fares for our International routes compared to the prior period. Increased capacity was driven by changes we made to our network in 2016, including the introduction of service of our route from Honolulu to Narita, Japan (July 2016) and expansion of service for the Kona to Haneda, Japan (December 2016) route.\nOther Operating Revenue\nOther operating revenue increased by $13.0 million, or 4.4%, in 2016, as compared to 2015, due to increased sale of miles and other revenue related to our co-branded credit card agreement and cancellation penalty revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nThe largest components of our operating expenses are wages and benefits provided to our employees, aircraft fuel (including taxes and delivery) and aircraft maintenance materials and repairs. Increases (decreases) in operating expenses are detailed below.

We define economic fuel expense as GAAP fuel expense plus (gains)/losses realized through actual cash (receipts)/payments received from or paid to hedge counterparties for fuel hedge derivative contracts settled in the period inclusive of costs related to hedging premiums.\nEconomic fuel expense is calculated as follows: Table 86: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except per-gallon amounts)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aircraft fuel expense, including taxes and delivery\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>344,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>417,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized losses on settlement of fuel derivative contracts\n</td> <td>27,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(54.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic fuel expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>371,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>478,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fuel gallons consumed\n</td> <td>244,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>234,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic fuel costs per gallon\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, for additional discussion of our jet fuel costs and related derivative program.\nWages and benefits expense increased by $56.0 million, or 11.2%, in 2016 as compared to 2015, due to an overall headcount increase of 11.7% due to our growing capacity in 2016, increased pension and postretirement benefit expenses, and increased profit-sharing expenses resulting from our improved financial performance as compared to the prior period.\nOther rentals and landing fees expense increased by $13.0 million, or 13.7%, in 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to increased rates, passengers, and landing frequencies. Also, we incurred additional cost year over year for our station rent amounts.\nPurchased services expense increased by $14.4 million, or 17.6%, in 2016 as compared to 2015, due to an increase in outsourced web and third-party vendor reservation fees because of increased passenger counts.\nIn 2016, we incurred $109.1 million in special items. The $109.1 million is comprised of three components: (1) $49.4 million in impairment charges in connection with our owned Boeing 767-300 fleet and related assets, (2) $38.8 million related to retroactive bonuses included within a tentative agreement between us and ALPA as of February 2017 and profit sharing for other contract groups, and (3) $21.0 million related to the termination of our Boeing 767-300 maintenance contract.\nThe impairment analysis and ultimate charge was triggered by the decision in the fourth quarter of 2016 to early exit the Boeing 767-300 fleet in 2018. The early exit of the Boeing 767-300 fleet was made possible by our decision to acquire one Airbus A330 (to be delivered in 2017), lease two additional Airbus A321s (to be delivered in 2018 and in addition to our existing aircraft orders), and our ability to early terminate our long-term power by the hour maintenance contract for the Boeing 767-300 fleet. This fleet change allows us to streamline our fleet, simplify our operations, and potentially reduce our cost structure in the future. In order to assess whether there was an impairment of the Boeing 767-300 asset group, we compared the projected undiscounted cash flows of the fleet to the book value of the assets and determined the book value was in excess of the undiscounted cash flows. We estimated the fair value of the Boeing 767-300 fleet assets using third party pricing information and quotes from potential buyers of our owned aircraft, which resulted in a $49.4 million impairment charge. Our\ndetermination of fair value considered attributes specific to our Boeing 767-300 fleet and aircraft condition (e.g. age, maintenance requirements, cycles, etc.). The Boeing 767-300 asset group consists of both owned and leased aircraft. We expect to remove three leased Boeing 767-300 aircraft from service in 2018. At that time, these aircraft will have remaining lease payments of approximately $54.3 million. At the time each aircraft is removed from service, we will accrue for any remaining lease payments not mitigated through an arrangement with the lessor.\nIn February 2017, we reached a tentative agreement with the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), covering our pilots. A ratification vote is set to occur in March 2017, however, we can provide no assurances that the tentative agreement will be approved at that time. The tentative agreement is for a 63-month contract amendment which includes (amongst other various benefits) a pay adjustment and ratification bonus. As of December 31, 2016, we accrued $34.0 million related to past service (prior to January 1, 2017), which is expected to be payable upon ratification. The final amount paid may differ when a final agreement is reached and ratified.\nOther expenses increased by $13.3 million, or 11.7%, in 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase in hotel expenses for our crew members, professional and technical fees, as well as personnel related expenses.\nNonoperating Expense\nNet nonoperating expense decreased by $114.4 million in 2016, as compared to 2015 due to reduced debt levels which resulted in a $19.1 million reduction in interest expense as compared to the prior year period. The decrease in net nonoperating expense was also due to gains on our fuel hedge portfolio of $20.1 million in 2016 compared to losses of $59.9 million in the prior year period.\n2015 vs. 2014\nPassenger Revenue\nPassenger revenue was $2.03 billion and $2.05 billion for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Details of these changes are described in the table below: Table 87: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Change in scheduled passenger revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in\nYield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in\nRPM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in\nASM\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International\n</td> <td>(88.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total scheduled\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(19.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDomestic revenue increased by $69.1 million in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to capacity increases on our North America routes, driven by the annualized impact of service introduced in 2014 and the introduction of a new cabin configuration to our fleet of Boeing 717-200 aircraft for our Neighbor Island routes.\nInternational revenue decreased by $88.5 million in 2015, as compared to 2014, due to decreased yield and capacity. The continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar combined with lower fuel surcharges resulted in decreased average fares for our International routes compared to the prior period. Decreased capacity was driven by changes we made to our network in 2014, including the suspension of our route from Honolulu to Taipei, Taiwan (March 2014) and Honolulu to Fukuoka, Japan (June 2014).\nOther Operating Revenue\nOther operating revenue increased by $22.0 million, or 8.2%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, due to $11.2 million generated by increased sales of frequent flyer miles under our co-branded credit card agreement, as compared to the prior year period. Additionally, a 9.0% increase in the number of passengers flown on our North America routes resulted in a $7.5 million increase in ancillary revenue compared to the prior year period.\nOperating Expenses\nIncreases (decreases) in operating expenses are detailed below.

</tr>\n</table>\nWages and benefits expense increased by $52.1 million, or 11.6%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, due to increased pension and postretirement benefit expenses and increased profit-sharing expenses resulting from our improved financial performance as compared to the prior period.\nAircraft rent expense increased by $9.2 million, or 8.7%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to the addition of three A330-200 aircraft under operating leases (one each in February 2015, May 2015, and October 2015), offset by the return of two Boeing 767-300 aircraft (one each in May 2015 and October 2015).\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by $9.2 million, or 9.6%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to the annualized effect of owned aircraft added to the fleet in the prior year period.\nOther rentals and landing fees expense increased by $7.2 million, or 8.1%, in 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to increased rates and landing frequencies.\nPurchased services expense increased by $8.5 million, or 11.5%, in 2015 as compared to 2014, due to costs incurred in connection with our turboprop operations and increased IT infrastructure costs.\nNonoperating Expense\nNet nonoperating expense decreased by $1.3 million in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to reduced debt levels which resulted in an $8.6 million reduction in interest expense as compared to the prior year period. Also our fuel hedge portfolio generated losses of $59.9 million in the current period compared to losses of $63.5 million in the prior year period. These reductions in nonoperating expense were partially offset by an $8.2 million increase in losses generated from the early extinguishment of long-term debt.\nIncome Tax Expense\nWe recorded income tax expense of $144.0 million, $113.0 million, and $44.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. In 2016, 2015, and 2014, we had an effective tax rate of 38.0%, 38.2%, and 39.2%, respectively.\nSee Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur liquidity is dependent on the cash we generate from operating activities, our existing cash resources, and our debt financing arrangements. As of December 31, 2016, we had $326.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $284.1 million in short-term investments, representing an increase of $50.0 million from December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our restricted cash balance of $5.0 million consisted of cash held as collateral by entities that process our credit card transactions for advanced ticket sales.\nWe have been able to generate sufficient funds from our operations to meet our working capital requirements and typically finance our aircraft through secured debt and lease financings. At December 31, 2016, we had $556.8 million of debt and capital lease obligations, including $58.9 million classified as a current liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2016, our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by approximately $31.9 million. However, approximately $482.5 million of our current liabilities are related to our advanced ticket sales and frequent flyer deferred revenue, both of which largely represent revenue to be recognized for travel within the next 12 months and not actual cash outlays. The deficit in working capital does not have an adverse impact to our cash flows, liquidity, or operations.\nIn December 2016, we amended and restated the existing credit agreement with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. by increasing the secured revolving credit facility (Revolving Credit Facility) from $175 million to $225 million. This Revolving Credit Facility will expire in December 2019. As of December 31, 2016 we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nCash Flows\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $417.4 million, $476.0 million, and $300.4 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The decrease in 2016 was primarily due to: (1) a $66.1 million decrease in our deferred income tax expense as a result of becoming a cash taxpayer, (2) a $46.7 million net decrease in the change to unrealized gains/losses on our fuel derivative contracts, and (3) a $42.7 million net increase in pension and postretirement benefit contributions, partially offset by (4) an increase of $52.8 million in net income and (5) a $49.4 million increase relating to the impairment of our Boeing 767-300 assets. The increase in 2015 was primarily due to the increased net income before deferred income tax expense, which does not impact our cash flows because our net operating loss carryforwards were used to satisfy this income tax obligation.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $154.1 million, $35.3 million, and $686.8 million for 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The increase in net cash used in 2016 was primarily due to a $69.9 million decrease in cash received compared to 2015, for purchase assignment and leaseback transactions, and engine credit payments received from the manufacturer. There was also an increase of $60.0 million in cash payments for property and equipment, including pre-delivery deposits for our Airbus A330-200 and Airbus A321neo fleet. The decrease in 2015 was due to acquisition of fewer aircraft during the year, which resulted in a $323.4 million reduction in capital expenditures. We also received $101.7 million from the purchase assignment and leaseback of three Airbus A330-200 aircraft during the year, and reduced our net purchases of investments by $240.2 million in 2015.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $218.8 million and $423.3 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively, and net cash provided by financing activities was $227.1 million for 2014. The decrease in cash used in 2016 was due to the lack of repurchases and payments for settlements of our convertible notes in 2016. The increase in cash used in financing activities in 2015 was due to the lack of long-term borrowings during the year, the early repayment of long-term debt, and the repurchase of convertible notes and common stock. This was partially offset by the net settlement of the convertible note call options and warrants.\nCovenants under our Financing Arrangements\nUnder our bank-issued credit card processing agreements, certain proceeds from advance ticket sales may be held back to serve as collateral to cover any possible chargebacks or other disputed charges that may occur. These holdbacks, which are included in restricted cash in our Consolidated Balance Sheets totaled $5.0 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nIn the event of a material adverse change in the business, the holdback could increase to an amount up to 100% of the applicable credit card activity for all unflown tickets, which would also result in an increase in the required level of restricted cash. If we are unable to obtain a waiver of, or otherwise mitigate the increase in the restriction of cash, it could have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Funding\nAs of December 31, 2016, the excess of the projected benefit obligations over the fair value of plan assets was approximately $359.3 million. We contributed $57.8 million, $20.4 million, and $8.9 million to our defined benefit pension plans and disability plan during 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Future funding requirements for our defined benefit and other postretirement plans are dependent upon many factors such as interest rates, funded status, applicable regulatory requirements, and the level and timing of asset returns. In 2017, we expect to contribute approximately $50.0 million to our defined benefit pension plans and disability plan.\nIn 2016, the Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. Pension Plan for Salaried Employees (Salaried Plan) was consolidated into the Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. Pension Plan for Employees Represented by the International Association of Machinists (IAM), which established the Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. Salaried & IAM Merged Pension Plan (the Merged Plan). At that time, the net liabilities of the Salaried Plan were transferred to the Merged Plan. The benefits under the Merged Plan have remained consistent with the prior plan documents. We, as plan sponsor, have submitted an application to the Department of Labor to settle the Merged Plan and expect to receive a response in 2017, at which time we intend to terminate the Merged Plan (if the application is approved by the Department of Labor). In 2017, we expect to spend approximately $17 million to $22 million to settle the plan obligations. As of December 31, 2016, there was no significant effect to the operation of the plans.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAn off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (i) made guarantees, (ii) retained a contingent interest in transferred assets, (iii) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or (iv) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with the company. We have no arrangements of the types described in the first three categories that we believe may have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. We do have obligations arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities related to certain aircraft leases. To the extent our leases and related guarantees are with a separate legal entity other than a governmental entity, we are not the primary beneficiary because the lease terms are consistent with market terms at the inception of the lease, and the lease does not include a residual value guarantee, fixed price purchase option, or similar feature.\nContractual Obligations\nOur estimated contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 are summarized in the following table: Table 91: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt and capital lease obligations(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>703,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>192,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>302,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases-aircraft and related equipment(2)\n</td> <td>741,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>235,889\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>162,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>222,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases-non-aircraft\n</td> <td>139,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitments-capital(3)\n</td> <td>1,565,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>240,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>888,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>386,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other commitments(4)\n</td> <td>703,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>390,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Projected employee benefit contributions(5)\n</td> <td>75,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,928,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>585,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,477,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>793,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,071,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Amounts reflect capital lease obligations for one Airbus A330-200 aircraft, two Boeing 717-200 aircraft, one Airbus A330 flight simulator, and aircraft and IT related equipment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Amounts reflect leases for ten Airbus A330-200 aircraft, four Boeing 767-300 aircraft, three Boeing 717-200 aircraft, three turboprop aircraft and aircraft-related equipment as of December 31, 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Amounts include our firm commitments for aircraft and aircraft related equipment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(4)\n</td> <td>Amounts include commitments for services provided by third-parties for aircraft maintenance for our Airbus fleet, capacity purchases, accounting, IT, reservations, and the estimated rental payments for the cargo and maintenance hangar (described below).

We have backstop financing available from aircraft and engine manufacturers, subject to certain customary conditions. Financing may be necessary to satisfy our capital commitments for firm order aircraft and other related capital expenditures. We can provide no assurance that any financing not already in place for aircraft and spare engine deliveries will be available to us on acceptable terms when necessary or at all.\nIn November 2016, we entered into a lease agreement with the Department of Transportation of the State of Hawai'i to lease a cargo and maintenance hangar at the Honolulu International Airport with a lease term of 35 years. The hangar is not fully completed and we have since taken responsibility for the remainder of the construction. We are obligated to fund the remaining construction costs needed to complete the hangar. While there is no minimum funding requirement, we estimate the cost to complete the hangar will be approximately $25.0 million to $35.0 million, which we expect to incur in 2017. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, specifically as it relates to our involvement in the construction of the hangar, we are considered the owner of the asset under construction and has recognized a $73.0 million asset, with a corresponding other liability, for the value of the construction previously completed.\nWe estimate that the hangar will be put into service in late 2017. At that time, we expect the lease to be considered a financing arrangement and a fixed asset of $73.0 million for the value of the construction previously completed plus any remaining amount spent by us and the $73.0 million liability will remain on our balance sheet. When construction is completed we will have on-going committed expenditures under the lease agreement consisting of ground rent (included in Operating leases - non-aircraft in the contractual obligations table above) and building rent and apron rent (included in Other commitments in the contractual obligations table above).\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe believe the disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures is useful information to readers of our financial statements because:\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We believe it is the basis by which we are evaluated by industry analysts and investors;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>These measures are often used in management and board of directors decision making analysis;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>It improves a reader's ability to compare our results to those of other airlines; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>It is consistent with how we present information in our quarterly earnings press releases.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> See table below for reconciliation between GAAP consolidated net income to adjusted consolidated net income, including per share amounts (in thousands unless otherwise indicated).

The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those accounting policies and accounting estimates that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and that potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Our most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below. See the summary of significant accounting policies included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the application of these estimates and other accounting policies.\nFrequent Flyer Accounting\nHawaiianMiles, Hawaiian's frequent flyer travel award program, provides a variety of awards to program members based on accumulated mileage. We utilize the incremental cost method of accounting for free travel awards earned by passengers issued from the HawaiianMiles program through flight activity. This method utilizes a number of estimates including the incremental cost per mile and breakage. We record a liability for the estimated incremental cost of providing travel awards that are expected to be redeemed on Hawaiian or the contractual rate of expected redemption on other airlines. We estimate the incremental cost of travel awards based on periodic studies of actual costs and apply these cost estimates to all issued miles, less an appropriate breakage factor for estimated miles that will not be redeemed. Incremental costs include the cost of fuel, meals and beverages, insurance and certain other passenger traffic-related costs, but does not include any costs for aircraft ownership and maintenance. The breakage factor is estimated based on an analysis of historical expirations.\nWe also sell mileage credits to companies participating in our frequent flyer program. These sales are accounted for as multiple-element arrangements, with one element representing the transportation that will ultimately be provided when the\nmileage credits are redeemed and the other elements consisting of marketing related activities that we conduct with the participating company.\nIn 2013, Hawaiian entered into a co-branded credit card agreement, which provides for the sale of frequent flyer miles to Barclays Bank Delaware (Barclays) which began in 2014. The agreement was a new multiple element arrangement subject to Accounting Standards Update 2009-13, Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements - A consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (ASU 2009-13), which was effective for new and materially modified revenue arrangements entered into by us after January 1, 2011. ASU 2009-13 requires the allocation of the overall consideration received to each deliverable using the estimated selling price. The objective of using estimated selling price based methodology is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis.\nThe following four deliverables or elements were identified in the agreement: (i) travel miles; (ii) use of the Hawaiian brand and access to member lists; (iii) advertising elements; and (iv) other airline benefits including checked baggage services and travel discounts. We determined the relative fair value of each element by estimating the selling prices of the deliverables by considering discounted cash flows using multiple inputs and assumptions, including: (1) the expected number of miles to be awarded and redeemed; (2) the estimated weighted average equivalent ticket value, adjusted by a fulfillment discount; (3) the estimated total annual cardholder spend; (4) an estimated royalty rate for the Hawaiian portfolio; and (5) the expected use of each of the airline benefits. The overall consideration received is allocated to the deliverables based on their relative selling prices. The transportation element is deferred and recognized as passenger revenue over the period when the transportation is expected to be provided (23 months). The other elements are generally recognized as other revenue when earned.\nUnder the programs of certain participating companies, credits are accumulated in accounts maintained by the participating company, then transferred into a member's HawaiianMiles account for immediate redemption of free travel awards. For those transactions, revenue is recognized over the period during which the mileage is projected to be used for travel (four months).\nOn an annual basis, we review the deferral period and deferral rate for mileage credits sold to participating companies (except for miles sold under our co-branded credit card agreement), as well as the breakage rate assumption for free travel awards earned in connection with the purchase of passenger tickets. The cost components of the incremental cost assumption are reviewed on a quarterly basis.\nPension and Other Postretirement and Postemployment Benefits\nThe calculation of pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit expenses and its corresponding liabilities require the use of significant assumptions, including the assumed discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, expected mortality rates of the plan participants, and the expected health care cost trend rate. Changes in these assumptions will impact the expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience may differ from these assumptions. The significant assumptions as of December 31, 2016 are as follows:\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate to determine projected benefit obligation\n</td> <td>4.19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected return on plan assets\n</td> <td>6.69\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Postretirement:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate to determine projected benefit obligation\n</td> <td>4.29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected return on plan assets\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected health care cost trend rate:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Initial\n</td> <td>7.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ultimate\n</td> <td>4.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years to reach ultimate trend rate\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Disability:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate to determine projected benefit obligation\n</td> <td>4.24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected return on plan assets\n</td> <td>5.37\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nN/A Not Applicable\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+\n</td> <td>Expected return on plan assets used to determine the net periodic benefit expense for 2017 is 6.34% for the pension plans and 4.60% for the disability plan.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The expected long-term rate of return assumption is developed by evaluating input from the trustee managing the plans' assets, including the trustee's review of asset class return expectations by several consultants and economists, as well as long-term\ninflation assumptions. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of assets, which is based on our goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels. The Retirement Plan for Pilots of Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. and the Pilot's Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association Disability and Survivor's Benefit Plan strive to have assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results from any one security class will not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio. The Merged pension plan strives to have its assets align with the potential liability as of the expected settlement date. We believe that our long-term asset allocation on average will approximate the targeted allocation. We periodically review our actual asset allocation and rebalance the pension plan's investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return will have the following effects on our estimated 2017 pension and disability benefit expense: Table 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>100 Basis Point Decrease\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in estimated 2017 pension expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in estimated 2017 disability benefit expense\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe determine the appropriate discount rate for each of our plans based on current rates on high quality corporate bonds that would generate the cash flow necessary to pay plan benefits when due. The pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and future expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced. Lowering the discount rate would have the following effects:\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>100 Basis Point Decrease\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in pension obligation as of December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in other postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>44.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in estimated 2017 pension expense\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in estimated 2017 other postretirement benefit expense\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe health care cost trend rate is based upon an evaluation of our historical trends and experience taking into account current and expected market conditions.

Any costs not expected to be recoverable are considered to be not substantially and contractually related to maintenance of the leased asset. Therefore, we bifurcate and expense the proportionate share that is estimated to not be recoverable from existing and future nonrefundable deposits. In determining whether it is probable that maintenance deposits will be used to fund the cost of the maintenance events, we conduct the following analysis:\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We evaluate the aircraft's condition, including the airframe, the engines, the auxiliary power unit and the landing gear.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We then project future usage of the aircraft during the term of the lease based on our business and fleet plan.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We estimate the cost of performing the next scheduled maintenance event.

Those key estimates and assumptions include our fleet plan and the projected total cost and, to a lesser extent, anticipated timing of the major maintenance activities covered by the maintenance reserves.\nBased on historical trends and future projections, including those published by the manufacturers of our aircraft and engines, we believe it is unlikely that future maintenance costs for our aircraft will decline to such an extent that the maintenance deposits currently recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets would not be used to fund the cost of future maintenance events and, therefore, not be recoverable.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Finite-lived Intangible Assets\nLong-lived assets used in operations, consisting principally of property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets, are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in management's judgment, that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amount. When testing for impairment management considers market trends, the expected useful lives of the assets, changes in economic conditions, recent transactions involving sales of similar assets and, if necessary, estimates of future undiscounted cash flows. To determine whether impairment exists for aircraft used in operations, assets are grouped at the fleet-type level (the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows) and future cash flows are estimated based on projections of capacity, passenger mile yield, fuel costs, labor costs and other relevant factors. If, at any time, management determines the net carrying value of an asset is not recoverable, the amount is reduced to its fair value during the period in which such determination is made. Any changes in the estimated useful lives of these assets will be accounted for prospectively.\nThe impairment analysis and ultimate charge was triggered by the decision in the fourth quarter of 2016 to exit the Boeing 767-300 fleet in 2018. The early exit of the Boeing 767-300 fleet was made possible by our decision to acquire one Airbus A330 (to be delivered in 2017), lease two additional Airbus A321s (to be delivered in 2018 and in addition to our existing aircraft orders), and our ability to early terminate our long-term power by the hour maintenance contract for the Boeing 767-300 fleet. This fleet change allows us to streamline our fleet, simplify our operations, and potentially reduce our cost structure in the future. In order to assess whether there was an impairment of the Boeing 767-300 asset group, we compared the projected undiscounted cash flows of the fleet to the book value of the assets and determined the book value was in excess of the undiscounted cash flows. We estimated the fair value of the Boeing 767-300 fleet assets using third party pricing information and quotes from potential buyers of our owned aircraft, which resulted in a $49.4 million impairment charge. Our determination of fair value considered attributes specific to our Boeing 767-300 fleet and aircraft condition (e.g. age, maintenance requirements, cycles, etc.). The Boeing 767-300 asset group consists of both owned and leased aircraft. We expect to remove three leased Boeing 767-300 aircraft from service in 2018. At that time, these aircraft will have remaining lease payments of approximately $54.3 million. At the time each aircraft is removed from service we will accrue for any remaining lease payments not mitigated through an arrangement with the lessor.", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I am unable to complete your table.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOverview\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand the Company and its operations. This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections of future events. However, our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein as a result of the risks that we face, including but not limited to those risks stated in the \"Risk Factors\" section of this report. See \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\" above. In addition, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.\nYear in Review\n2016 Financial Highlights\n \u2022 Operating income decreased to $395 million compared to $426 million in the prior-year period. \n \u2022 Pre-tax income grew to $379 million compared to $296 million in the prior-year period. \n \u2022 GAAP net income of $235 million or $4.36 per diluted share compared to $183 million or $2.98 per diluted share in the prior year period. \n \u2022 Adjusted net income of $280 million or $5.19 per diluted share compared to $189 million or $3.09 per share in the prior year period. \n \u2022 Unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $610 million compared to $560 million in the prior year period. \n \u2022 Extinguished $141 million of debt instruments that were originally scheduled to mature in 2022 and 2023.  See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for our reconciliation of non-GAAP measures.\nOutlook\nWe expect our financial performance to remain strong in the first quarter of 2017, as compared to the first quarter of 2016. We expect our passenger revenues to increase, coupled with expected increases in our aircraft fuel, wages and benefits, and rent expense which could potentially put pressure on our operating margins (as compared to 2016). We expect available seat miles during the first quarter of 2017 to increase by 2.5% to 4.5% from the same prior year period. Despite the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, a decrease in fuel surcharges on our international routes, and an increase in industry capacity on our Neighbor Island routes, operating revenue per available seat mile could increase by up to 4.0% to 7.0% from the same prior year period.\nThe table below is a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP CASM ex-fuel guidance for the first quarter of 2017.\n\nSelected Consolidated Statistical Data\nBelow are the operating statistics we use to measure our operating performance. \n (a) Includes the operations of our contract carrier under a capacity purchase agreement. Total Operations includes both scheduled and chartered operations. \n (b) Represents adjusted unit costs, a non-GAAP measure. We believe this is a useful measure because it better reflects our controllable costs. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for our reconciliation of non-GAAP measures. \n (c) Includes applicable taxes and fees.  Operating Revenue\nOur revenue is derived primarily from transporting passengers on our aircraft. Revenue is recognized when either the transportation is provided or when the related ticket expires unused. We measure capacity in terms of available seat miles, which represent the number of seats available for passengers multiplied by the number of miles the seats are flown. Yield, or the average amount one passenger pays to fly one mile, is calculated by dividing passenger revenue by RPMs. We strive to increase passenger revenue primarily by increasing our yield per flight or by filling a higher proportion of available seats, which produces higher operating revenue per available seat mile. Other revenue primarily consists of baggage fees, cargo revenue, incidental services revenue, ticket change and cancellation fees, marketing component related to the sale of frequent flyer miles, inflight revenue, contract services and charter services revenue.\nOperating revenue was $2.45 billion, $2.32 billion and $2.31 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The increase in operating revenue in 2016 from 2015 was driven primarily by an increase in passenger revenue and is discussed below:\n2016 vs. 2015\nPassenger Revenue\nPassenger revenue was $2.15 billion and $2.03 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Details of these changes are described in the table below: \nDomestic revenue increased by $104.2 million in 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to capacity, yield, and load factor increases on our North America routes; along with increases in capacity on our Neighbor Island routes.\nInternational revenue increased by $15.9 million in 2016, as compared to 2015, due to increased capacity. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar combined with lower fuel surcharges resulted in decreased average fares for our International routes compared to the prior period. Increased capacity was driven by changes we made to our network in 2016, including the introduction of service of our route from Honolulu to Narita, Japan (July 2016) and expansion of service for the Kona to Haneda, Japan (December 2016) route.\nOther Operating Revenue\nOther operating revenue increased by $13.0 million, or 4.4%, in 2016, as compared to 2015, due to increased sale of miles and other revenue related to our co-branded credit card agreement and cancellation penalty revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nThe largest components of our operating expenses are wages and benefits provided to our employees, aircraft fuel (including taxes and delivery) and aircraft maintenance materials and repairs. Increases (decreases) in operating expenses are detailed below. \nThe price and availability of aircraft fuel is extremely volatile due to global economic and geopolitical factors that we can neither control nor accurately predict. The decreases in aircraft fuel expense are illustrated in the following table: \nThe decrease in fuel expense from 2016 to 2015 is primarily due to the decrease in average fuel price per gallon, partially offset by increased fuel consumption due to an additional aircraft in the fleet (Airbus 330-200).\nWe believe economic fuel expense is the best measure of the effect of fuel prices on our business as it most closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with the purchase of fuel for our operations and is consistent with how management manages our business and assesses our operating performance. We define economic fuel expense as GAAP fuel expense plus (gains)/losses realized through actual cash (receipts)/payments received from or paid to hedge counterparties for fuel hedge derivative contracts settled in the period inclusive of costs related to hedging premiums.\nEconomic fuel expense is calculated as follows: \nSee Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, for additional discussion of our jet fuel costs and related derivative program.\nWages and benefits expense increased by $56.0 million, or 11.2%, in 2016 as compared to 2015, due to an overall headcount increase of 11.7% due to our growing capacity in 2016, increased pension and postretirement benefit expenses, and increased profit-sharing expenses resulting from our improved financial performance as compared to the prior period.\nOther rentals and landing fees expense increased by $13.0 million, or 13.7%, in 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to increased rates, passengers, and landing frequencies. Also, we incurred additional cost year over year for our station rent amounts.\nPurchased services expense increased by $14.4 million, or 17.6%, in 2016 as compared to 2015, due to an increase in outsourced web and third-party vendor reservation fees because of increased passenger counts.\nIn 2016, we incurred $109.1 million in special items. The $109.1 million is comprised of three components: (1) $49.4 million in impairment charges in connection with our owned Boeing 767-300 fleet and related assets, (2) $38.8 million related to retroactive bonuses included within a tentative agreement between us and ALPA as of February 2017 and profit sharing for other contract groups, and (3) $21.0 million related to the termination of our Boeing 767-300 maintenance contract.\nThe impairment analysis and ultimate charge was triggered by the decision in the fourth quarter of 2016 to early exit the Boeing 767-300 fleet in 2018. The early exit of the Boeing 767-300 fleet was made possible by our decision to acquire one Airbus A330 (to be delivered in 2017), lease two additional Airbus A321s (to be delivered in 2018 and in addition to our existing aircraft orders), and our ability to early terminate our long-term power by the hour maintenance contract for the Boeing 767-300 fleet. This fleet change allows us to streamline our fleet, simplify our operations, and potentially reduce our cost structure in the future. In order to assess whether there was an impairment of the Boeing 767-300 asset group, we compared the projected undiscounted cash flows of the fleet to the book value of the assets and determined the book value was in excess of the undiscounted cash flows. We estimated the fair value of the Boeing 767-300 fleet assets using third party pricing information and quotes from potential buyers of our owned aircraft, which resulted in a $49.4 million impairment charge. Our\ndetermination of fair value considered attributes specific to our Boeing 767-300 fleet and aircraft condition (e.g. age, maintenance requirements, cycles, etc.). The Boeing 767-300 asset group consists of both owned and leased aircraft. We expect to remove three leased Boeing 767-300 aircraft from service in 2018. At that time, these aircraft will have remaining lease payments of approximately $54.3 million. At the time each aircraft is removed from service, we will accrue for any remaining lease payments not mitigated through an arrangement with the lessor.\nIn February 2017, we reached a tentative agreement with the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), covering our pilots. A ratification vote is set to occur in March 2017, however, we can provide no assurances that the tentative agreement will be approved at that time. The tentative agreement is for a 63-month contract amendment which includes (amongst other various benefits) a pay adjustment and ratification bonus. As of December 31, 2016, we accrued $34.0 million related to past service (prior to January 1, 2017), which is expected to be payable upon ratification. The final amount paid may differ when a final agreement is reached and ratified.\nOther expenses increased by $13.3 million, or 11.7%, in 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase in hotel expenses for our crew members, professional and technical fees, as well as personnel related expenses.\nNonoperating Expense\nNet nonoperating expense decreased by $114.4 million in 2016, as compared to 2015 due to reduced debt levels which resulted in a $19.1 million reduction in interest expense as compared to the prior year period. The decrease in net nonoperating expense was also due to gains on our fuel hedge portfolio of $20.1 million in 2016 compared to losses of $59.9 million in the prior year period.\n2015 vs. 2014\nPassenger Revenue\nPassenger revenue was $2.03 billion and $2.05 billion for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Details of these changes are described in the table below: \nDomestic revenue increased by $69.1 million in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to capacity increases on our North America routes, driven by the annualized impact of service introduced in 2014 and the introduction of a new cabin configuration to our fleet of Boeing 717-200 aircraft for our Neighbor Island routes.\nInternational revenue decreased by $88.5 million in 2015, as compared to 2014, due to decreased yield and capacity. The continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar combined with lower fuel surcharges resulted in decreased average fares for our International routes compared to the prior period. Decreased capacity was driven by changes we made to our network in 2014, including the suspension of our route from Honolulu to Taipei, Taiwan (March 2014) and Honolulu to Fukuoka, Japan (June 2014).\nOther Operating Revenue\nOther operating revenue increased by $22.0 million, or 8.2%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, due to $11.2 million generated by increased sales of frequent flyer miles under our co-branded credit card agreement, as compared to the prior year period. Additionally, a 9.0% increase in the number of passengers flown on our North America routes resulted in a $7.5 million increase in ancillary revenue compared to the prior year period.\nOperating Expenses\nIncreases (decreases) in operating expenses are detailed below. \nDecreases in aircraft fuel expense are illustrated in the following table: \nThe decrease in fuel expense from 2015 to 2014 is primarily due to a decrease in the average fuel price per gallon, partially offset by increased fuel consumption due to the additional aircraft in the fleet (three additional A330-200 offset by the return of two Boeing 767-300 aircraft at the end of their lease term).\nEconomic fuel expense is calculated as follows: \nWages and benefits expense increased by $52.1 million, or 11.6%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, due to increased pension and postretirement benefit expenses and increased profit-sharing expenses resulting from our improved financial performance as compared to the prior period.\nAircraft rent expense increased by $9.2 million, or 8.7%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to the addition of three A330-200 aircraft under operating leases (one each in February 2015, May 2015, and October 2015), offset by the return of two Boeing 767-300 aircraft (one each in May 2015 and October 2015).\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by $9.2 million, or 9.6%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to the annualized effect of owned aircraft added to the fleet in the prior year period.\nOther rentals and landing fees expense increased by $7.2 million, or 8.1%, in 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to increased rates and landing frequencies.\nPurchased services expense increased by $8.5 million, or 11.5%, in 2015 as compared to 2014, due to costs incurred in connection with our turboprop operations and increased IT infrastructure costs.\nNonoperating Expense\nNet nonoperating expense decreased by $1.3 million in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to reduced debt levels which resulted in an $8.6 million reduction in interest expense as compared to the prior year period. Also our fuel hedge portfolio generated losses of $59.9 million in the current period compared to losses of $63.5 million in the prior year period. These reductions in nonoperating expense were partially offset by an $8.2 million increase in losses generated from the early extinguishment of long-term debt.\nIncome Tax Expense\nWe recorded income tax expense of $144.0 million, $113.0 million, and $44.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. In 2016, 2015, and 2014, we had an effective tax rate of 38.0%, 38.2%, and 39.2%, respectively.\nSee Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur liquidity is dependent on the cash we generate from operating activities, our existing cash resources, and our debt financing arrangements. As of December 31, 2016, we had $326.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $284.1 million in short-term investments, representing an increase of $50.0 million from December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our restricted cash balance of $5.0 million consisted of cash held as collateral by entities that process our credit card transactions for advanced ticket sales.\nWe have been able to generate sufficient funds from our operations to meet our working capital requirements and typically finance our aircraft through secured debt and lease financings. At December 31, 2016, we had $556.8 million of debt and capital lease obligations, including $58.9 million classified as a current liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2016, our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by approximately $31.9 million. However, approximately $482.5 million of our current liabilities are related to our advanced ticket sales and frequent flyer deferred revenue, both of which largely represent revenue to be recognized for travel within the next 12 months and not actual cash outlays. The deficit in working capital does not have an adverse impact to our cash flows, liquidity, or operations.\nIn December 2016, we amended and restated the existing credit agreement with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. by increasing the secured revolving credit facility (Revolving Credit Facility) from $175 million to $225 million. This Revolving Credit Facility will expire in December 2019. As of December 31, 2016 we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nCash Flows\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $417.4 million, $476.0 million, and $300.4 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The decrease in 2016 was primarily due to: (1) a $66.1 million decrease in our deferred income tax expense as a result of becoming a cash taxpayer, (2) a $46.7 million net decrease in the change to unrealized gains/losses on our fuel derivative contracts, and (3) a $42.7 million net increase in pension and postretirement benefit contributions, partially offset by (4) an increase of $52.8 million in net income and (5) a $49.4 million increase relating to the impairment of our Boeing 767-300 assets. The increase in 2015 was primarily due to the increased net income before deferred income tax expense, which does not impact our cash flows because our net operating loss carryforwards were used to satisfy this income tax obligation.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $154.1 million, $35.3 million, and $686.8 million for 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The increase in net cash used in 2016 was primarily due to a $69.9 million decrease in cash received compared to 2015, for purchase assignment and leaseback transactions, and engine credit payments received from the manufacturer. There was also an increase of $60.0 million in cash payments for property and equipment, including pre-delivery deposits for our Airbus A330-200 and Airbus A321neo fleet. The decrease in 2015 was due to acquisition of fewer aircraft during the year, which resulted in a $323.4 million reduction in capital expenditures. We also received $101.7 million from the purchase assignment and leaseback of three Airbus A330-200 aircraft during the year, and reduced our net purchases of investments by $240.2 million in 2015.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $218.8 million and $423.3 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively, and net cash provided by financing activities was $227.1 million for 2014. The decrease in cash used in 2016 was due to the lack of repurchases and payments for settlements of our convertible notes in 2016. The increase in cash used in financing activities in 2015 was due to the lack of long-term borrowings during the year, the early repayment of long-term debt, and the repurchase of convertible notes and common stock. This was partially offset by the net settlement of the convertible note call options and warrants.\nCovenants under our Financing Arrangements\nUnder our bank-issued credit card processing agreements, certain proceeds from advance ticket sales may be held back to serve as collateral to cover any possible chargebacks or other disputed charges that may occur. These holdbacks, which are included in restricted cash in our Consolidated Balance Sheets totaled $5.0 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nIn the event of a material adverse change in the business, the holdback could increase to an amount up to 100% of the applicable credit card activity for all unflown tickets, which would also result in an increase in the required level of restricted cash. If we are unable to obtain a waiver of, or otherwise mitigate the increase in the restriction of cash, it could have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Funding\nAs of December 31, 2016, the excess of the projected benefit obligations over the fair value of plan assets was approximately $359.3 million. We contributed $57.8 million, $20.4 million, and $8.9 million to our defined benefit pension plans and disability plan during 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Future funding requirements for our defined benefit and other postretirement plans are dependent upon many factors such as interest rates, funded status, applicable regulatory requirements, and the level and timing of asset returns. In 2017, we expect to contribute approximately $50.0 million to our defined benefit pension plans and disability plan.\nIn 2016, the Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. Pension Plan for Salaried Employees (Salaried Plan) was consolidated into the Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. Pension Plan for Employees Represented by the International Association of Machinists (IAM), which established the Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. Salaried & IAM Merged Pension Plan (the Merged Plan). At that time, the net liabilities of the Salaried Plan were transferred to the Merged Plan. The benefits under the Merged Plan have remained consistent with the prior plan documents. We, as plan sponsor, have submitted an application to the Department of Labor to settle the Merged Plan and expect to receive a response in 2017, at which time we intend to terminate the Merged Plan (if the application is approved by the Department of Labor). In 2017, we expect to spend approximately $17 million to $22 million to settle the plan obligations. As of December 31, 2016, there was no significant effect to the operation of the plans.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAn off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (i) made guarantees, (ii) retained a contingent interest in transferred assets, (iii) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or (iv) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with the company. We have no arrangements of the types described in the first three categories that we believe may have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. We do have obligations arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities related to certain aircraft leases. To the extent our leases and related guarantees are with a separate legal entity other than a governmental entity, we are not the primary beneficiary because the lease terms are consistent with market terms at the inception of the lease, and the lease does not include a residual value guarantee, fixed price purchase option, or similar feature.\nContractual Obligations\nOur estimated contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 are summarized in the following table: \n (1) Amounts reflect capital lease obligations for one Airbus A330-200 aircraft, two Boeing 717-200 aircraft, one Airbus A330 flight simulator, and aircraft and IT related equipment. \n (2) Amounts reflect leases for ten Airbus A330-200 aircraft, four Boeing 767-300 aircraft, three Boeing 717-200 aircraft, three turboprop aircraft and aircraft-related equipment as of December 31, 2016. \n (3) Amounts include our firm commitments for aircraft and aircraft related equipment. \n (4) Amounts include commitments for services provided by third-parties for aircraft maintenance for our Airbus fleet, capacity purchases, accounting, IT, reservations, and the estimated rental payments for the cargo and maintenance hangar (described below). Total contractual obligations do not include long-term contracts where the commitment is variable in nature (with no minimum guarantee), such as aircraft maintenance deposits due under operating leases and fees due under certain other agreements such as aircraft maintenance power-by-the-hour, computer reservation systems and credit card processing agreements, or when the agreements contain short-term cancellation provisions. \n (5) Amounts include our estimated contributions to our pension plans (based on actuarially determined estimates) and our pilots' disability plan. Amounts are subject to change based on numerous factors, including interest rate levels, the amount and timing of asset returns and the impact of future legislation. We are currently unable to estimate the projected contributions beyond 2019.  Capital Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had the following capital commitments consisting of firm aircraft and engine orders and purchase rights:\n\nCommitted expenditures for these aircraft, engines, and related flight equipment are approximately $241 million in 2017, $401 million in 2018, $488 million in 2019, $229 million in 2020, $158 million in 2021, and $49 million thereafter.\nIn order to complete the purchase of these aircraft and fund related costs, we may need to secure acceptable financing. We have backstop financing available from aircraft and engine manufacturers, subject to certain customary conditions. Financing may be necessary to satisfy our capital commitments for firm order aircraft and other related capital expenditures. We can provide no assurance that any financing not already in place for aircraft and spare engine deliveries will be available to us on acceptable terms when necessary or at all.\nIn November 2016, we entered into a lease agreement with the Department of Transportation of the State of Hawai'i to lease a cargo and maintenance hangar at the Honolulu International Airport with a lease term of 35 years. The hangar is not fully completed and we have since taken responsibility for the remainder of the construction. We are obligated to fund the remaining construction costs needed to complete the hangar. While there is no minimum funding requirement, we estimate the cost to complete the hangar will be approximately $25.0 million to $35.0 million, which we expect to incur in 2017. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, specifically as it relates to our involvement in the construction of the hangar, we are considered the owner of the asset under construction and has recognized a $73.0 million asset, with a corresponding other liability, for the value of the construction previously completed.\nWe estimate that the hangar will be put into service in late 2017. At that time, we expect the lease to be considered a financing arrangement and a fixed asset of $73.0 million for the value of the construction previously completed plus any remaining amount spent by us and the $73.0 million liability will remain on our balance sheet. When construction is completed we will have on-going committed expenditures under the lease agreement consisting of ground rent (included in Operating leases - non-aircraft in the contractual obligations table above) and building rent and apron rent (included in Other commitments in the contractual obligations table above).\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe believe the disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures is useful information to readers of our financial statements because:\n \u2022 We believe it is the basis by which we are evaluated by industry analysts and investors; \n \u2022 These measures are often used in management and board of directors decision making analysis; \n \u2022 It improves a reader's ability to compare our results to those of other airlines; and \n \u2022 It is consistent with how we present information in our quarterly earnings press releases.  See table below for reconciliation between GAAP consolidated net income to adjusted consolidated net income, including per share amounts (in thousands unless otherwise indicated). The adjustments are described below:\n \u2022 Changes in fair value of derivative contracts, net of tax, are based on market prices for open contracts as of the end of the reporting period. This line item includes the unrealized amounts of fuel and interest rate derivatives (not designated as hedges) that will settle in future periods and the reversal of prior period unrealized amounts. Excluding the impact of these derivative adjustments allows investors to better analyze our core operational performance and more readily compare our results to other airlines in the periods presented below. \n \u2022 Loss on extinguishment of debt, net of tax, is excluded to allow investors to better analyze our core operational performance and more readily compare our results to other airlines in the periods presented below. \n \u2022 The impairment and maintenance contract termination charges related to the early retirement of our fleet of Boeing 767-300 aircraft, engines, and related assets along with the retroactive bonuses and a proposed collective bargaining agreement payment are considered special items and are not expected to represent ongoing expenses to us. Excluding these special items allows investors to better analyze our core operational performance and more readily compare our results to other airlines in the periods presented below. \n\nOperating Costs per Available Seat Mile (CASM)\nListed in the table below is our fuel costs per ASM and non-GAAP unit costs, excluding fuel. These amounts are included in CASM, but for internal purposes we consistently use cost metrics that exclude fuel and non-recurring items (if applicable) to measure and monitor its costs.\nCASM and CASM, excluding fuel, are summarized in the table below: \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those accounting policies and accounting estimates that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and that potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Our most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below. See the summary of significant accounting policies included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the application of these estimates and other accounting policies.\nFrequent Flyer Accounting\nHawaiianMiles, Hawaiian's frequent flyer travel award program, provides a variety of awards to program members based on accumulated mileage. We utilize the incremental cost method of accounting for free travel awards earned by passengers issued from the HawaiianMiles program through flight activity. This method utilizes a number of estimates including the incremental cost per mile and breakage. We record a liability for the estimated incremental cost of providing travel awards that are expected to be redeemed on Hawaiian or the contractual rate of expected redemption on other airlines. We estimate the incremental cost of travel awards based on periodic studies of actual costs and apply these cost estimates to all issued miles, less an appropriate breakage factor for estimated miles that will not be redeemed. Incremental costs include the cost of fuel, meals and beverages, insurance and certain other passenger traffic-related costs, but does not include any costs for aircraft ownership and maintenance. The breakage factor is estimated based on an analysis of historical expirations.\nWe also sell mileage credits to companies participating in our frequent flyer program. These sales are accounted for as multiple-element arrangements, with one element representing the transportation that will ultimately be provided when the\nmileage credits are redeemed and the other elements consisting of marketing related activities that we conduct with the participating company.\nIn 2013, Hawaiian entered into a co-branded credit card agreement, which provides for the sale of frequent flyer miles to Barclays Bank Delaware (Barclays) which began in 2014. The agreement was a new multiple element arrangement subject to Accounting Standards Update 2009-13, Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements - A consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (ASU 2009-13), which was effective for new and materially modified revenue arrangements entered into by us after January 1, 2011. ASU 2009-13 requires the allocation of the overall consideration received to each deliverable using the estimated selling price. The objective of using estimated selling price based methodology is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis.\nThe following four deliverables or elements were identified in the agreement: (i) travel miles; (ii) use of the Hawaiian brand and access to member lists; (iii) advertising elements; and (iv) other airline benefits including checked baggage services and travel discounts. We determined the relative fair value of each element by estimating the selling prices of the deliverables by considering discounted cash flows using multiple inputs and assumptions, including: (1) the expected number of miles to be awarded and redeemed; (2) the estimated weighted average equivalent ticket value, adjusted by a fulfillment discount; (3) the estimated total annual cardholder spend; (4) an estimated royalty rate for the Hawaiian portfolio; and (5) the expected use of each of the airline benefits. The overall consideration received is allocated to the deliverables based on their relative selling prices. The transportation element is deferred and recognized as passenger revenue over the period when the transportation is expected to be provided (23 months). The other elements are generally recognized as other revenue when earned.\nUnder the programs of certain participating companies, credits are accumulated in accounts maintained by the participating company, then transferred into a member's HawaiianMiles account for immediate redemption of free travel awards. For those transactions, revenue is recognized over the period during which the mileage is projected to be used for travel (four months).\nOn an annual basis, we review the deferral period and deferral rate for mileage credits sold to participating companies (except for miles sold under our co-branded credit card agreement), as well as the breakage rate assumption for free travel awards earned in connection with the purchase of passenger tickets. The cost components of the incremental cost assumption are reviewed on a quarterly basis.\nPension and Other Postretirement and Postemployment Benefits\nThe calculation of pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit expenses and its corresponding liabilities require the use of significant assumptions, including the assumed discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, expected mortality rates of the plan participants, and the expected health care cost trend rate. Changes in these assumptions will impact the expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience may differ from these assumptions. The significant assumptions as of December 31, 2016 are as follows:\n\nN/A Not Applicable\n + Expected return on plan assets used to determine the net periodic benefit expense for 2017 is 6.34% for the pension plans and 4.60% for the disability plan.  The expected long-term rate of return assumption is developed by evaluating input from the trustee managing the plans' assets, including the trustee's review of asset class return expectations by several consultants and economists, as well as long-term\ninflation assumptions. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of assets, which is based on our goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels. The Retirement Plan for Pilots of Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. and the Pilot's Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association Disability and Survivor's Benefit Plan strive to have assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results from any one security class will not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio. The Merged pension plan strives to have its assets align with the potential liability as of the expected settlement date. We believe that our long-term asset allocation on average will approximate the targeted allocation. We periodically review our actual asset allocation and rebalance the pension plan's investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return will have the following effects on our estimated 2017 pension and disability benefit expense: \nWe determine the appropriate discount rate for each of our plans based on current rates on high quality corporate bonds that would generate the cash flow necessary to pay plan benefits when due. The pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and future expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced. Lowering the discount rate would have the following effects:\n\nThe health care cost trend rate is based upon an evaluation of our historical trends and experience taking into account current and expected market conditions. Changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following annual effects:\n\n\nAircraft Maintenance and Repair Costs\nOn a quarterly basis we complete a forecast of maintenance costs for the next scheduled event on applicable leased aircraft and compare these estimates to our forecasted nonrefundable deposits to identify costs not expected to be recoverable. Any costs not expected to be recoverable are considered to be not substantially and contractually related to maintenance of the leased asset. Therefore, we bifurcate and expense the proportionate share that is estimated to not be recoverable from existing and future nonrefundable deposits. In determining whether it is probable that maintenance deposits will be used to fund the cost of the maintenance events, we conduct the following analysis:\n \u2022 We evaluate the aircraft's condition, including the airframe, the engines, the auxiliary power unit and the landing gear. \n \u2022 We then project future usage of the aircraft during the term of the lease based on our business and fleet plan. \n \u2022 We estimate the cost of performing the next scheduled maintenance event. These estimates are based on the experience of our maintenance personnel and available industry data, including historical fleet operating statistic reports published by the aircraft and engine manufacturers. \n \u2022 We compare the forecasted maintenance deposits to be paid at the time of the next scheduled maintenance event to the estimated cost of the next scheduled maintenance event. Those costs not expected to be recoverable are considered to be not substantially and contractually related to maintenance of the leased asset. \n \u2022 We prospectively account for any changes in estimates.  Our assessment of the recoverability of our maintenance deposits is subject to change in the event that key estimates and assumptions change over time. Those key estimates and assumptions include our fleet plan and the projected total cost and, to a lesser extent, anticipated timing of the major maintenance activities covered by the maintenance reserves.\nBased on historical trends and future projections, including those published by the manufacturers of our aircraft and engines, we believe it is unlikely that future maintenance costs for our aircraft will decline to such an extent that the maintenance deposits currently recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets would not be used to fund the cost of future maintenance events and, therefore, not be recoverable.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Finite-lived Intangible Assets\nLong-lived assets used in operations, consisting principally of property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets, are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in management's judgment, that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amount. When testing for impairment management considers market trends, the expected useful lives of the assets, changes in economic conditions, recent transactions involving sales of similar assets and, if necessary, estimates of future undiscounted cash flows. To determine whether impairment exists for aircraft used in operations, assets are grouped at the fleet-type level (the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows) and future cash flows are estimated based on projections of capacity, passenger mile yield, fuel costs, labor costs and other relevant factors. If, at any time, management determines the net carrying value of an asset is not recoverable, the amount is reduced to its fair value during the period in which such determination is made. Any changes in the estimated useful lives of these assets will be accounted for prospectively.\nThe impairment analysis and ultimate charge was triggered by the decision in the fourth quarter of 2016 to exit the Boeing 767-300 fleet in 2018. The early exit of the Boeing 767-300 fleet was made possible by our decision to acquire one Airbus A330 (to be delivered in 2017), lease two additional Airbus A321s (to be delivered in 2018 and in addition to our existing aircraft orders), and our ability to early terminate our long-term power by the hour maintenance contract for the Boeing 767-300 fleet. This fleet change allows us to streamline our fleet, simplify our operations, and potentially reduce our cost structure in the future. In order to assess whether there was an impairment of the Boeing 767-300 asset group, we compared the projected undiscounted cash flows of the fleet to the book value of the assets and determined the book value was in excess of the undiscounted cash flows. We estimated the fair value of the Boeing 767-300 fleet assets using third party pricing information and quotes from potential buyers of our owned aircraft, which resulted in a $49.4 million impairment charge. Our determination of fair value considered attributes specific to our Boeing 767-300 fleet and aircraft condition (e.g. age, maintenance requirements, cycles, etc.). The Boeing 767-300 asset group consists of both owned and leased aircraft. We expect to remove three leased Boeing 767-300 aircraft from service in 2018. At that time, these aircraft will have remaining lease payments of approximately $54.3 million. At the time each aircraft is removed from service we will accrue for any remaining lease payments not mitigated through an arrangement with the lessor.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOverview\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand the Company and its operations. This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections of future events. However, our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein as a result of the risks that we face, including but not limited to those risks stated in the \"Risk Factors\" section of this report. See \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\" above. In addition, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.\nYear in Review\n2016 Financial Highlights\n \u2022 Operating income decreased to $395 million compared to $426 million in the prior-year period. \n \u2022 Pre-tax income grew to $379 million compared to $296 million in the prior-year period. \n \u2022 GAAP net income of $235 million or $4.36 per diluted share compared to $183 million or $2.98 per diluted share in the prior year period. \n \u2022 Adjusted net income of $280 million or $5.19 per diluted share compared to $189 million or $3.09 per share in the prior year period. \n \u2022 Unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $610 million compared to $560 million in the prior year period. \n \u2022 Extinguished $141 million of debt instruments that were originally scheduled to mature in 2022 and 2023.  See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for our reconciliation of non-GAAP measures.\nOutlook\nWe expect our financial performance to remain strong in the first quarter of 2017, as compared to the first quarter of 2016. We expect our passenger revenues to increase, coupled with expected increases in our aircraft fuel, wages and benefits, and rent expense which could potentially put pressure on our operating margins (as compared to 2016). We expect available seat miles during the first quarter of 2017 to increase by 2.5% to 4.5% from the same prior year period. Despite the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, a decrease in fuel surcharges on our international routes, and an increase in industry capacity on our Neighbor Island routes, operating revenue per available seat mile could increase by up to 4.0% to 7.0% from the same prior year period.\nThe table below is a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP CASM ex-fuel guidance for the first quarter of 2017.\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated three months ending March 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except as otherwise indicated)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>511,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>539,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: aircraft fuel, including taxes and delivery\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100,235\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(108,248\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted operating expenses - excluding aircraft fuel\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>411,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>431,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Available Seat Miles\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,477,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,564,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CASM - GAAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.43\n</td> <td>\u00a2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.83\n</td> <td>\u00a2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: aircraft fuel\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.24\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.37\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CASM - excluding aircraft fuel\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.19\n</td> <td>\u00a2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.46\n</td> <td>\u00a2\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelected Consolidated Statistical Data\nBelow are the operating statistics we use to measure our operating performance.

Total Operations includes both scheduled and chartered operations. \n (b) Represents adjusted unit costs, a non-GAAP measure. We believe this is a useful measure because it better reflects our controllable costs. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for our reconciliation of non-GAAP measures. \n (c) Includes applicable taxes and fees.  Operating Revenue\nOur revenue is derived primarily from transporting passengers on our aircraft. Revenue is recognized when either the transportation is provided or when the related ticket expires unused. We measure capacity in terms of available seat miles, which represent the number of seats available for passengers multiplied by the number of miles the seats are flown. Yield, or the average amount one passenger pays to fly one mile, is calculated by dividing passenger revenue by RPMs. We strive to increase passenger revenue primarily by increasing our yield per flight or by filling a higher proportion of available seats, which produces higher operating revenue per available seat mile. Other revenue primarily consists of baggage fees, cargo revenue, incidental services revenue, ticket change and cancellation fees, marketing component related to the sale of frequent flyer miles, inflight revenue, contract services and charter services revenue.\nOperating revenue was $2.45 billion, $2.32 billion and $2.31 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The increase in operating revenue in 2016 from 2015 was driven primarily by an increase in passenger revenue and is discussed below:\n2016 vs. 2015\nPassenger Revenue\nPassenger revenue was $2.15 billion and $2.03 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

The strengthening of the U.S. dollar combined with lower fuel surcharges resulted in decreased average fares for our International routes compared to the prior period. Increased capacity was driven by changes we made to our network in 2016, including the introduction of service of our route from Honolulu to Narita, Japan (July 2016) and expansion of service for the Kona to Haneda, Japan (December 2016) route.\nOther Operating Revenue\nOther operating revenue increased by $13.0 million, or 4.4%, in 2016, as compared to 2015, due to increased sale of miles and other revenue related to our co-branded credit card agreement and cancellation penalty revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nThe largest components of our operating expenses are wages and benefits provided to our employees, aircraft fuel (including taxes and delivery) and aircraft maintenance materials and repairs. Increases (decreases) in operating expenses are detailed below.

We define economic fuel expense as GAAP fuel expense plus (gains)/losses realized through actual cash (receipts)/payments received from or paid to hedge counterparties for fuel hedge derivative contracts settled in the period inclusive of costs related to hedging premiums.\nEconomic fuel expense is calculated as follows: Table 86: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except per-gallon amounts)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aircraft fuel expense, including taxes and delivery\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>344,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>417,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized losses on settlement of fuel derivative contracts\n</td> <td>27,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(54.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic fuel expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>371,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>478,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fuel gallons consumed\n</td> <td>244,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>234,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic fuel costs per gallon\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, for additional discussion of our jet fuel costs and related derivative program.\nWages and benefits expense increased by $56.0 million, or 11.2%, in 2016 as compared to 2015, due to an overall headcount increase of 11.7% due to our growing capacity in 2016, increased pension and postretirement benefit expenses, and increased profit-sharing expenses resulting from our improved financial performance as compared to the prior period.\nOther rentals and landing fees expense increased by $13.0 million, or 13.7%, in 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to increased rates, passengers, and landing frequencies. Also, we incurred additional cost year over year for our station rent amounts.\nPurchased services expense increased by $14.4 million, or 17.6%, in 2016 as compared to 2015, due to an increase in outsourced web and third-party vendor reservation fees because of increased passenger counts.\nIn 2016, we incurred $109.1 million in special items. The $109.1 million is comprised of three components: (1) $49.4 million in impairment charges in connection with our owned Boeing 767-300 fleet and related assets, (2) $38.8 million related to retroactive bonuses included within a tentative agreement between us and ALPA as of February 2017 and profit sharing for other contract groups, and (3) $21.0 million related to the termination of our Boeing 767-300 maintenance contract.\nThe impairment analysis and ultimate charge was triggered by the decision in the fourth quarter of 2016 to early exit the Boeing 767-300 fleet in 2018. The early exit of the Boeing 767-300 fleet was made possible by our decision to acquire one Airbus A330 (to be delivered in 2017), lease two additional Airbus A321s (to be delivered in 2018 and in addition to our existing aircraft orders), and our ability to early terminate our long-term power by the hour maintenance contract for the Boeing 767-300 fleet. This fleet change allows us to streamline our fleet, simplify our operations, and potentially reduce our cost structure in the future. In order to assess whether there was an impairment of the Boeing 767-300 asset group, we compared the projected undiscounted cash flows of the fleet to the book value of the assets and determined the book value was in excess of the undiscounted cash flows. We estimated the fair value of the Boeing 767-300 fleet assets using third party pricing information and quotes from potential buyers of our owned aircraft, which resulted in a $49.4 million impairment charge. Our\ndetermination of fair value considered attributes specific to our Boeing 767-300 fleet and aircraft condition (e.g. age, maintenance requirements, cycles, etc.). The Boeing 767-300 asset group consists of both owned and leased aircraft. We expect to remove three leased Boeing 767-300 aircraft from service in 2018. At that time, these aircraft will have remaining lease payments of approximately $54.3 million. At the time each aircraft is removed from service, we will accrue for any remaining lease payments not mitigated through an arrangement with the lessor.\nIn February 2017, we reached a tentative agreement with the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), covering our pilots. A ratification vote is set to occur in March 2017, however, we can provide no assurances that the tentative agreement will be approved at that time. The tentative agreement is for a 63-month contract amendment which includes (amongst other various benefits) a pay adjustment and ratification bonus. As of December 31, 2016, we accrued $34.0 million related to past service (prior to January 1, 2017), which is expected to be payable upon ratification. The final amount paid may differ when a final agreement is reached and ratified.\nOther expenses increased by $13.3 million, or 11.7%, in 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase in hotel expenses for our crew members, professional and technical fees, as well as personnel related expenses.\nNonoperating Expense\nNet nonoperating expense decreased by $114.4 million in 2016, as compared to 2015 due to reduced debt levels which resulted in a $19.1 million reduction in interest expense as compared to the prior year period. The decrease in net nonoperating expense was also due to gains on our fuel hedge portfolio of $20.1 million in 2016 compared to losses of $59.9 million in the prior year period.\n2015 vs. 2014\nPassenger Revenue\nPassenger revenue was $2.03 billion and $2.05 billion for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

The continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar combined with lower fuel surcharges resulted in decreased average fares for our International routes compared to the prior period. Decreased capacity was driven by changes we made to our network in 2014, including the suspension of our route from Honolulu to Taipei, Taiwan (March 2014) and Honolulu to Fukuoka, Japan (June 2014).\nOther Operating Revenue\nOther operating revenue increased by $22.0 million, or 8.2%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, due to $11.2 million generated by increased sales of frequent flyer miles under our co-branded credit card agreement, as compared to the prior year period. Additionally, a 9.0% increase in the number of passengers flown on our North America routes resulted in a $7.5 million increase in ancillary revenue compared to the prior year period.\nOperating Expenses\nIncreases (decreases) in operating expenses are detailed below.

</tr>\n</table>\nWages and benefits expense increased by $52.1 million, or 11.6%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, due to increased pension and postretirement benefit expenses and increased profit-sharing expenses resulting from our improved financial performance as compared to the prior period.\nAircraft rent expense increased by $9.2 million, or 8.7%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to the addition of three A330-200 aircraft under operating leases (one each in February 2015, May 2015, and October 2015), offset by the return of two Boeing 767-300 aircraft (one each in May 2015 and October 2015).\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by $9.2 million, or 9.6%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to the annualized effect of owned aircraft added to the fleet in the prior year period.\nOther rentals and landing fees expense increased by $7.2 million, or 8.1%, in 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to increased rates and landing frequencies.\nPurchased services expense increased by $8.5 million, or 11.5%, in 2015 as compared to 2014, due to costs incurred in connection with our turboprop operations and increased IT infrastructure costs.\nNonoperating Expense\nNet nonoperating expense decreased by $1.3 million in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to reduced debt levels which resulted in an $8.6 million reduction in interest expense as compared to the prior year period. Also our fuel hedge portfolio generated losses of $59.9 million in the current period compared to losses of $63.5 million in the prior year period. These reductions in nonoperating expense were partially offset by an $8.2 million increase in losses generated from the early extinguishment of long-term debt.\nIncome Tax Expense\nWe recorded income tax expense of $144.0 million, $113.0 million, and $44.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. In 2016, 2015, and 2014, we had an effective tax rate of 38.0%, 38.2%, and 39.2%, respectively.\nSee Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur liquidity is dependent on the cash we generate from operating activities, our existing cash resources, and our debt financing arrangements. As of December 31, 2016, we had $326.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $284.1 million in short-term investments, representing an increase of $50.0 million from December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our restricted cash balance of $5.0 million consisted of cash held as collateral by entities that process our credit card transactions for advanced ticket sales.\nWe have been able to generate sufficient funds from our operations to meet our working capital requirements and typically finance our aircraft through secured debt and lease financings. At December 31, 2016, we had $556.8 million of debt and capital lease obligations, including $58.9 million classified as a current liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2016, our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by approximately $31.9 million. However, approximately $482.5 million of our current liabilities are related to our advanced ticket sales and frequent flyer deferred revenue, both of which largely represent revenue to be recognized for travel within the next 12 months and not actual cash outlays. The deficit in working capital does not have an adverse impact to our cash flows, liquidity, or operations.\nIn December 2016, we amended and restated the existing credit agreement with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. by increasing the secured revolving credit facility (Revolving Credit Facility) from $175 million to $225 million. This Revolving Credit Facility will expire in December 2019. As of December 31, 2016 we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nCash Flows\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $417.4 million, $476.0 million, and $300.4 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The decrease in 2016 was primarily due to: (1) a $66.1 million decrease in our deferred income tax expense as a result of becoming a cash taxpayer, (2) a $46.7 million net decrease in the change to unrealized gains/losses on our fuel derivative contracts, and (3) a $42.7 million net increase in pension and postretirement benefit contributions, partially offset by (4) an increase of $52.8 million in net income and (5) a $49.4 million increase relating to the impairment of our Boeing 767-300 assets. The increase in 2015 was primarily due to the increased net income before deferred income tax expense, which does not impact our cash flows because our net operating loss carryforwards were used to satisfy this income tax obligation.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $154.1 million, $35.3 million, and $686.8 million for 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The increase in net cash used in 2016 was primarily due to a $69.9 million decrease in cash received compared to 2015, for purchase assignment and leaseback transactions, and engine credit payments received from the manufacturer. There was also an increase of $60.0 million in cash payments for property and equipment, including pre-delivery deposits for our Airbus A330-200 and Airbus A321neo fleet. The decrease in 2015 was due to acquisition of fewer aircraft during the year, which resulted in a $323.4 million reduction in capital expenditures. We also received $101.7 million from the purchase assignment and leaseback of three Airbus A330-200 aircraft during the year, and reduced our net purchases of investments by $240.2 million in 2015.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $218.8 million and $423.3 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively, and net cash provided by financing activities was $227.1 million for 2014. The decrease in cash used in 2016 was due to the lack of repurchases and payments for settlements of our convertible notes in 2016. The increase in cash used in financing activities in 2015 was due to the lack of long-term borrowings during the year, the early repayment of long-term debt, and the repurchase of convertible notes and common stock. This was partially offset by the net settlement of the convertible note call options and warrants.\nCovenants under our Financing Arrangements\nUnder our bank-issued credit card processing agreements, certain proceeds from advance ticket sales may be held back to serve as collateral to cover any possible chargebacks or other disputed charges that may occur. These holdbacks, which are included in restricted cash in our Consolidated Balance Sheets totaled $5.0 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nIn the event of a material adverse change in the business, the holdback could increase to an amount up to 100% of the applicable credit card activity for all unflown tickets, which would also result in an increase in the required level of restricted cash. If we are unable to obtain a waiver of, or otherwise mitigate the increase in the restriction of cash, it could have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Funding\nAs of December 31, 2016, the excess of the projected benefit obligations over the fair value of plan assets was approximately $359.3 million. We contributed $57.8 million, $20.4 million, and $8.9 million to our defined benefit pension plans and disability plan during 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Future funding requirements for our defined benefit and other postretirement plans are dependent upon many factors such as interest rates, funded status, applicable regulatory requirements, and the level and timing of asset returns. In 2017, we expect to contribute approximately $50.0 million to our defined benefit pension plans and disability plan.\nIn 2016, the Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. Pension Plan for Salaried Employees (Salaried Plan) was consolidated into the Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. Pension Plan for Employees Represented by the International Association of Machinists (IAM), which established the Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. Salaried & IAM Merged Pension Plan (the Merged Plan). At that time, the net liabilities of the Salaried Plan were transferred to the Merged Plan. The benefits under the Merged Plan have remained consistent with the prior plan documents. We, as plan sponsor, have submitted an application to the Department of Labor to settle the Merged Plan and expect to receive a response in 2017, at which time we intend to terminate the Merged Plan (if the application is approved by the Department of Labor). In 2017, we expect to spend approximately $17 million to $22 million to settle the plan obligations. As of December 31, 2016, there was no significant effect to the operation of the plans.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAn off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (i) made guarantees, (ii) retained a contingent interest in transferred assets, (iii) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or (iv) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with the company. We have no arrangements of the types described in the first three categories that we believe may have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. We do have obligations arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities related to certain aircraft leases. To the extent our leases and related guarantees are with a separate legal entity other than a governmental entity, we are not the primary beneficiary because the lease terms are consistent with market terms at the inception of the lease, and the lease does not include a residual value guarantee, fixed price purchase option, or similar feature.\nContractual Obligations\nOur estimated contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 are summarized in the following table: Table 91: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt and capital lease obligations(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>703,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>192,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>302,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases-aircraft and related equipment(2)\n</td> <td>741,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>235,889\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>162,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>222,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases-non-aircraft\n</td> <td>139,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitments-capital(3)\n</td> <td>1,565,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>240,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>888,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>386,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other commitments(4)\n</td> <td>703,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>390,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Projected employee benefit contributions(5)\n</td> <td>75,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,928,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>585,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,477,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>793,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,071,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Amounts reflect capital lease obligations for one Airbus A330-200 aircraft, two Boeing 717-200 aircraft, one Airbus A330 flight simulator, and aircraft and IT related equipment. \n (2) Amounts reflect leases for ten Airbus A330-200 aircraft, four Boeing 767-300 aircraft, three Boeing 717-200 aircraft, three turboprop aircraft and aircraft-related equipment as of December 31, 2016. \n (3) Amounts include our firm commitments for aircraft and aircraft related equipment. \n (4) Amounts include commitments for services provided by third-parties for aircraft maintenance for our Airbus fleet, capacity purchases, accounting, IT, reservations, and the estimated rental payments for the cargo and maintenance hangar (described below). Total contractual obligations do not include long-term contracts where the commitment is variable in nature (with no minimum guarantee), such as aircraft maintenance deposits due under operating leases and fees due under certain other agreements such as aircraft maintenance power-by-the-hour, computer reservation systems and credit card processing agreements, or when the agreements contain short-term cancellation provisions. \n (5) Amounts include our estimated contributions to our pension plans (based on actuarially determined estimates) and our pilots' disability plan. Amounts are subject to change based on numerous factors, including interest rate levels, the amount and timing of asset returns and the impact of future legislation. We are currently unable to estimate the projected contributions beyond 2019.  Capital Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had the following capital commitments consisting of firm aircraft and engine orders and purchase rights:\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aircraft Type\n</td> <td>Firm\nOrders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Purchase\nRights\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Expected Delivery Dates\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>A330-200 aircraft\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>In 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>A321neo aircraft\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Between 2017 and 2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>A330-800neo aircraft\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Between 2019 and 2021\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pratt & Whitney spare engines:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>A321neo spare engines\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Between 2017 and 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rolls-Royce spare engines:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>A330-800neo spare engines\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Between 2019 and 2020\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommitted expenditures for these aircraft, engines, and related flight equipment are approximately $241 million in 2017, $401 million in 2018, $488 million in 2019, $229 million in 2020, $158 million in 2021, and $49 million thereafter.\nIn order to complete the purchase of these aircraft and fund related costs, we may need to secure acceptable financing. We have backstop financing available from aircraft and engine manufacturers, subject to certain customary conditions. Financing may be necessary to satisfy our capital commitments for firm order aircraft and other related capital expenditures. We can provide no assurance that any financing not already in place for aircraft and spare engine deliveries will be available to us on acceptable terms when necessary or at all.\nIn November 2016, we entered into a lease agreement with the Department of Transportation of the State of Hawai'i to lease a cargo and maintenance hangar at the Honolulu International Airport with a lease term of 35 years. The hangar is not fully completed and we have since taken responsibility for the remainder of the construction. We are obligated to fund the remaining construction costs needed to complete the hangar. While there is no minimum funding requirement, we estimate the cost to complete the hangar will be approximately $25.0 million to $35.0 million, which we expect to incur in 2017. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, specifically as it relates to our involvement in the construction of the hangar, we are considered the owner of the asset under construction and has recognized a $73.0 million asset, with a corresponding other liability, for the value of the construction previously completed.\nWe estimate that the hangar will be put into service in late 2017. At that time, we expect the lease to be considered a financing arrangement and a fixed asset of $73.0 million for the value of the construction previously completed plus any remaining amount spent by us and the $73.0 million liability will remain on our balance sheet. When construction is completed we will have on-going committed expenditures under the lease agreement consisting of ground rent (included in Operating leases - non-aircraft in the contractual obligations table above) and building rent and apron rent (included in Other commitments in the contractual obligations table above).\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe believe the disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures is useful information to readers of our financial statements because:\n \u2022 We believe it is the basis by which we are evaluated by industry analysts and investors; \n \u2022 These measures are often used in management and board of directors decision making analysis; \n \u2022 It improves a reader's ability to compare our results to those of other airlines; and \n \u2022 It is consistent with how we present information in our quarterly earnings press releases.  See table below for reconciliation between GAAP consolidated net income to adjusted consolidated net income, including per share amounts (in thousands unless otherwise indicated). The adjustments are described below:\n \u2022 Changes in fair value of derivative contracts, net of tax, are based on market prices for open contracts as of the end of the reporting period. This line item includes the unrealized amounts of fuel and interest rate derivatives (not designated as hedges) that will settle in future periods and the reversal of prior period unrealized amounts. Excluding the impact of these derivative adjustments allows investors to better analyze our core operational performance and more readily compare our results to other airlines in the periods presented below. \n \u2022 Loss on extinguishment of debt, net of tax, is excluded to allow investors to better analyze our core operational performance and more readily compare our results to other airlines in the periods presented below. \n \u2022 The impairment and maintenance contract termination charges related to the early retirement of our fleet of Boeing 767-300 aircraft, engines, and related assets along with the retroactive bonuses and a proposed collective bargaining agreement payment are considered special items and are not expected to represent ongoing expenses to us.

The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those accounting policies and accounting estimates that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and that potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Our most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below. See the summary of significant accounting policies included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the application of these estimates and other accounting policies.\nFrequent Flyer Accounting\nHawaiianMiles, Hawaiian's frequent flyer travel award program, provides a variety of awards to program members based on accumulated mileage. We utilize the incremental cost method of accounting for free travel awards earned by passengers issued from the HawaiianMiles program through flight activity. This method utilizes a number of estimates including the incremental cost per mile and breakage. We record a liability for the estimated incremental cost of providing travel awards that are expected to be redeemed on Hawaiian or the contractual rate of expected redemption on other airlines. We estimate the incremental cost of travel awards based on periodic studies of actual costs and apply these cost estimates to all issued miles, less an appropriate breakage factor for estimated miles that will not be redeemed. Incremental costs include the cost of fuel, meals and beverages, insurance and certain other passenger traffic-related costs, but does not include any costs for aircraft ownership and maintenance. The breakage factor is estimated based on an analysis of historical expirations.\nWe also sell mileage credits to companies participating in our frequent flyer program. These sales are accounted for as multiple-element arrangements, with one element representing the transportation that will ultimately be provided when the\nmileage credits are redeemed and the other elements consisting of marketing related activities that we conduct with the participating company.\nIn 2013, Hawaiian entered into a co-branded credit card agreement, which provides for the sale of frequent flyer miles to Barclays Bank Delaware (Barclays) which began in 2014. The agreement was a new multiple element arrangement subject to Accounting Standards Update 2009-13, Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements - A consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (ASU 2009-13), which was effective for new and materially modified revenue arrangements entered into by us after January 1, 2011. ASU 2009-13 requires the allocation of the overall consideration received to each deliverable using the estimated selling price. The objective of using estimated selling price based methodology is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis.\nThe following four deliverables or elements were identified in the agreement: (i) travel miles; (ii) use of the Hawaiian brand and access to member lists; (iii) advertising elements; and (iv) other airline benefits including checked baggage services and travel discounts. We determined the relative fair value of each element by estimating the selling prices of the deliverables by considering discounted cash flows using multiple inputs and assumptions, including: (1) the expected number of miles to be awarded and redeemed; (2) the estimated weighted average equivalent ticket value, adjusted by a fulfillment discount; (3) the estimated total annual cardholder spend; (4) an estimated royalty rate for the Hawaiian portfolio; and (5) the expected use of each of the airline benefits. The overall consideration received is allocated to the deliverables based on their relative selling prices. The transportation element is deferred and recognized as passenger revenue over the period when the transportation is expected to be provided (23 months). The other elements are generally recognized as other revenue when earned.\nUnder the programs of certain participating companies, credits are accumulated in accounts maintained by the participating company, then transferred into a member's HawaiianMiles account for immediate redemption of free travel awards. For those transactions, revenue is recognized over the period during which the mileage is projected to be used for travel (four months).\nOn an annual basis, we review the deferral period and deferral rate for mileage credits sold to participating companies (except for miles sold under our co-branded credit card agreement), as well as the breakage rate assumption for free travel awards earned in connection with the purchase of passenger tickets. The cost components of the incremental cost assumption are reviewed on a quarterly basis.\nPension and Other Postretirement and Postemployment Benefits\nThe calculation of pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit expenses and its corresponding liabilities require the use of significant assumptions, including the assumed discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, expected mortality rates of the plan participants, and the expected health care cost trend rate. Changes in these assumptions will impact the expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience may differ from these assumptions. The significant assumptions as of December 31, 2016 are as follows:\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate to determine projected benefit obligation\n</td> <td>4.19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected return on plan assets\n</td> <td>6.69\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Postretirement:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate to determine projected benefit obligation\n</td> <td>4.29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected return on plan assets\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected health care cost trend rate:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Initial\n</td> <td>7.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ultimate\n</td> <td>4.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years to reach ultimate trend rate\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Disability:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate to determine projected benefit obligation\n</td> <td>4.24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected return on plan assets\n</td> <td>5.37\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nN/A Not Applicable\n + Expected return on plan assets used to determine the net periodic benefit expense for 2017 is 6.34% for the pension plans and 4.60% for the disability plan.  The expected long-term rate of return assumption is developed by evaluating input from the trustee managing the plans' assets, including the trustee's review of asset class return expectations by several consultants and economists, as well as long-term\ninflation assumptions. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of assets, which is based on our goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels. The Retirement Plan for Pilots of Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. and the Pilot's Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association Disability and Survivor's Benefit Plan strive to have assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results from any one security class will not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio. The Merged pension plan strives to have its assets align with the potential liability as of the expected settlement date. We believe that our long-term asset allocation on average will approximate the targeted allocation. We periodically review our actual asset allocation and rebalance the pension plan's investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return will have the following effects on our estimated 2017 pension and disability benefit expense: Table 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>100 Basis Point Decrease\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in estimated 2017 pension expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in estimated 2017 disability benefit expense\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe determine the appropriate discount rate for each of our plans based on current rates on high quality corporate bonds that would generate the cash flow necessary to pay plan benefits when due. The pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and future expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced. Lowering the discount rate would have the following effects:\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>100 Basis Point Decrease\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in pension obligation as of December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in other postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>44.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in estimated 2017 pension expense\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in estimated 2017 other postretirement benefit expense\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe health care cost trend rate is based upon an evaluation of our historical trends and experience taking into account current and expected market conditions.

Any costs not expected to be recoverable are considered to be not substantially and contractually related to maintenance of the leased asset. Therefore, we bifurcate and expense the proportionate share that is estimated to not be recoverable from existing and future nonrefundable deposits. In determining whether it is probable that maintenance deposits will be used to fund the cost of the maintenance events, we conduct the following analysis:\n \u2022 We evaluate the aircraft's condition, including the airframe, the engines, the auxiliary power unit and the landing gear. \n \u2022 We then project future usage of the aircraft during the term of the lease based on our business and fleet plan. \n \u2022 We estimate the cost of performing the next scheduled maintenance event. These estimates are based on the experience of our maintenance personnel and available industry data, including historical fleet operating statistic reports published by the aircraft and engine manufacturers. \n \u2022 We compare the forecasted maintenance deposits to be paid at the time of the next scheduled maintenance event to the estimated cost of the next scheduled maintenance event. Those costs not expected to be recoverable are considered to be not substantially and contractually related to maintenance of the leased asset. \n \u2022 We prospectively account for any changes in estimates.  Our assessment of the recoverability of our maintenance deposits is subject to change in the event that key estimates and assumptions change over time. Those key estimates and assumptions include our fleet plan and the projected total cost and, to a lesser extent, anticipated timing of the major maintenance activities covered by the maintenance reserves.\nBased on historical trends and future projections, including those published by the manufacturers of our aircraft and engines, we believe it is unlikely that future maintenance costs for our aircraft will decline to such an extent that the maintenance deposits currently recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets would not be used to fund the cost of future maintenance events and, therefore, not be recoverable.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Finite-lived Intangible Assets\nLong-lived assets used in operations, consisting principally of property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets, are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in management's judgment, that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amount. When testing for impairment management considers market trends, the expected useful lives of the assets, changes in economic conditions, recent transactions involving sales of similar assets and, if necessary, estimates of future undiscounted cash flows. To determine whether impairment exists for aircraft used in operations, assets are grouped at the fleet-type level (the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows) and future cash flows are estimated based on projections of capacity, passenger mile yield, fuel costs, labor costs and other relevant factors. If, at any time, management determines the net carrying value of an asset is not recoverable, the amount is reduced to its fair value during the period in which such determination is made. Any changes in the estimated useful lives of these assets will be accounted for prospectively.\nThe impairment analysis and ultimate charge was triggered by the decision in the fourth quarter of 2016 to exit the Boeing 767-300 fleet in 2018. The early exit of the Boeing 767-300 fleet was made possible by our decision to acquire one Airbus A330 (to be delivered in 2017), lease two additional Airbus A321s (to be delivered in 2018 and in addition to our existing aircraft orders), and our ability to early terminate our long-term power by the hour maintenance contract for the Boeing 767-300 fleet. This fleet change allows us to streamline our fleet, simplify our operations, and potentially reduce our cost structure in the future. In order to assess whether there was an impairment of the Boeing 767-300 asset group, we compared the projected undiscounted cash flows of the fleet to the book value of the assets and determined the book value was in excess of the undiscounted cash flows. We estimated the fair value of the Boeing 767-300 fleet assets using third party pricing information and quotes from potential buyers of our owned aircraft, which resulted in a $49.4 million impairment charge. Our determination of fair value considered attributes specific to our Boeing 767-300 fleet and aircraft condition (e.g. age, maintenance requirements, cycles, etc.). The Boeing 767-300 asset group consists of both owned and leased aircraft. We expect to remove three leased Boeing 767-300 aircraft from service in 2018. At that time, these aircraft will have remaining lease payments of approximately $54.3 million. At the time each aircraft is removed from service we will accrue for any remaining lease payments not mitigated through an arrangement with the lessor."}
