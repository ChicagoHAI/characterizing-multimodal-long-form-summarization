MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Historical results may not indicate future performance. Our forward-looking statements reflect our current views about future events, are based on assumptions, and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Factors that may cause differences between actual results and those contemplated by forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in \"Risk Factors\" in Part I, Item 1A, of this Annual Report. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, including any changes that might result from any facts, events, or circumstances after the date hereof that may bear upon forward-looking statements. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee future results, events, levels of activity, performance, or achievements.\nThis MD&A is intended to assist in understanding and assessing the trends and significant changes in our results of operations and financial condition. As used in this MD&A, the words, \"we\", \"our\", and \"us\" refer to GTT Communications and its consolidated subsidiaries. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nCompany Overview\nGTT Communications, Inc. is a provider of cloud networking services to multinational clients. We offer a broad portfolio of global services including: WAN services; Internet services; managed network and security services; and voice and unified communication services.\nOur global Tier 1 IP network delivers connectivity for our clients around the world. We provide services to leading multinational enterprises, carriers and government customers in over 100 countries. We differentiate ourselves from our competition by delivering service to our clients with simplicity, speed and agility.\nWe deliver four primary service offerings to our customers:\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>WAN Services. We provide Layer 2 (Ethernet) and Layer 3 (MPLS) WAN solutions to meet the growing needs of multinational enterprises, carriers, service providers and content delivery networks regardless of location. We design and implement custom private, public and hybrid cloud network solutions for our customers, offering bandwidth speeds from 10 Mbps to 100 Gbps per port with burstable and aggregate bandwidth capabilities. All services are available on a protected basis with the ability to specify pre-configured alternate routes to minimize the impact of any network disruption.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Internet Services. We offer domestic and multinational customers scalable, high-bandwidth global Internet connectivity and IP transit with guaranteed availability and packet delivery. Our Internet services offer flexible connectivity with multiple port interfaces including Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, 10 Gigabit Ethernet and 100 Gigabit Ethernet. We also offer broadband and wireless access services. We support a dual stack of IPv4 and IPv6 protocols, enabling the delivery of seamless IPv6 services alongside existing IPv4 services.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Managed Services. We offer fully managed network services, including managed equipment, managed security services and managed remote access, enabling customers to focus on their core business. These end-to-end services cover the design, procurement, implementation, monitoring and maintenance of a customer's network.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Voice and Unified Communication Services. Our SIP Trunking service is an enterprise-built unified communications offering that integrates voice, video and chat onto a single IP connection, driving efficiency and productivity organization-wide. Our Enterprise PBX service allows clients to eliminate traditional voice infrastructure with communication services delivered through the cloud. The offering includes fully hosted and hybrid models for maximum flexibility.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur customer contracts are generally for initial terms of three years, with some contracts at one year, and others at five years or more. Following the initial terms, these agreements typically provide for automatic renewal for specified periods ranging from one month to one year. Our prices are fixed for the duration of the contract, and we typically bill monthly in advance for such services. If a customer terminates its agreement, the terms of the Company's customer contracts typically require full recovery of any amounts due for the remainder of the term or, at a minimum, our liability to any underlying suppliers.\nOur revenue is composed of three primary categories that include monthly recurring revenue (or \"MRR\"), non-recurring revenue and usage revenue. MRR relates to contracted ongoing service that is generally fixed in price and paid by the customer on a monthly basis for the contracted term. For the year ended December 31, 2016, MRR was approximately 91% of our revenue. Non-recurring revenue primarily includes the amortization of previously collected installation and equipment charges to customers, and one-time termination charges for customers who cancel their services prior to the contract termination date. Usage revenue represents variable revenue based on whether a customer exceeds its committed usage threshold as specified in the contract.\nOur network supplier contracts do not have any market related net settlement provisions. We have not entered into, and do not plan to enter into, any supplier contracts that involve financial or derivative instruments. The supplier contracts are entered into solely for the direct purchase of telecommunications capacity, which is resold by us in the normal course of business.\nOther than cost of telecommunications services provided, our most significant operating expenses are employment costs. As of December 31, 2016, we had 662 full-time equivalent employees. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the employee cash compensation and benefits represented approximately 16% of revenue.\nFactors Affecting Our Results of Operations\nBusiness Acquisitions\nSince our formation, we have consummated a number of transactions accounted for as business combinations which were executed as part of our strategy of expanding through acquisitions. These acquisitions, which are in addition to our periodic purchases of customer contracts, have allowed us to increase the scale at which we operate which in turn affords us the ability to increase our operating leverage, extend our network, and broaden our customer base.The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the operations of the acquired entities from their respective acquisition dates. The acquisitions noted below are collectively defined as \"Acquisitions\" for purposes of explaining our results of operations.\nTelnes\nIn February 2016, we completed the acquisition of Telnes Broadband (\"Telnes\"). We paid $15.5 million in cash and issued 178,202 unregistered shares of our common stock valued at $2.0 million.\nOne Source\nIn October 2015, we completed the acquisition of One Source Networks Inc. (\"One Source\"). We paid $169.3 million in cash and issued 185,946 unregistered shares of our common stock valued at $2.3 million. We also issued 289,055 unregistered shares of our common stock to certain One Source employees as compensation for continuous employment valued at $3.6 million.\nMegaPath\nIn April 2015, we acquired MegaPath Corporation (\"MegaPath\"). We paid $141.4 million in cash (exclusive of the assumption of $3.4 million in capital leases), and issued 610,843 unregistered shares of our common stock valued at $7.5 million.\nUNSi\nIn October 2014, we acquired United Networks Services, Inc. (\"UNSi\"). We paid $32.5 million in cash and issued 231,539 of unregistered shares of our common stock valued at $2.9 million.\nAsset Purchases\nPeriodically we acquire customer contracts that we account for as an asset purchase and record a corresponding intangible asset that is amortized over its assumed useful life. During 2016 we acquired two portfolios of customer contracts for an aggregate purchase price of $41.3 million, of which $20 million was paid in 2016 at the respective closing dates. The remaining $21.3 million will be paid in 2017. We did not have any material asset purchases in 2015 or 2014, respectively.\nIndebtedness\nThe following summarizes our long-term debt at December 31, 2016 and 2015 (amounts in thousands):\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term loan\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>425,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>400,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>7.875% Senior Note\n</td> <td>300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving line of credit facility\n</td> <td>20,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt obligations\n</td> <td>745,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>405,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unamortized debt issuance costs\n</td> <td>(9,310\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,938\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unamortized original issuance discount\n</td> <td>(6,957\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,819\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Carrying value of debt\n</td> <td>729,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>386,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less current portion\n</td> <td>(4,300\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>725,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>382,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOctober 2015 Credit Agreement\nIn October 2015, we entered into a credit agreement (the October 2015 Credit Agreement\u201d) that provided for a $400.0 million term loan facility and a $50.0 million revolving line of credit facility (which includes a $15.0 million letter of credit facility and a $10.0 million swingline facility). The term loan facility was issued at a discount of $8.0 million. The maturity date of the term loan facility is October 22, 2022, and the maturity date of the revolving line of credit is October 22, 2020.\nOn May 3, 2016, we entered into an incremental term loan agreement that increased outstanding term loans by $30.0 million, the proceeds of which were used to repay the then outstanding revolving loans.\nOn June 28, 2016, we entered into Amendment No. 1 (the \"Repricing Amendment\") to the October 2015 Credit Agreement. The Repricing Amendment, among other things, reduced the applicable rate for term loans to LIBOR plus 4.75% (subject to a LIBOR floor of 1.00%) and reduced the applicable rate for revolving loans to LIBOR plus 4.25% (with no LIBOR floor).\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had drawn $20.0 million under the revolving line of credit and had $29.5 million of available borrowing capacity. Approximately $0.5 million of the revolving line of credit was utilized for outstanding letters of credit relating to our real estate lease obligations.\nOur obligations under the October 2015 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets. We were in compliance with all financial covenants under the October 2015 Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2016.\nThe effective interest rate on outstanding debt at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was 5.76% and 6.24% respectively.\n7.875% Senior Unsecured Notes\nOn December 22, 2016, in connection with the pending acquisitions of Hibernia Networks, we completed a private offering of $300 million aggregate principal amount of 7.875% senior unsecured notes due in 2024 (the \"Notes\"). The proceeds of the private offering were deposited into escrow, where the funds remained until all the escrow release conditions were satisfied, most notably the closing of the acquisition of Hibernia Networks on January 9, 2017. Had the acquisition agreement been terminated, the funds in escrow would have been released and returned to the investors of the Notes, including accrued and unpaid interest up to the date of release. We have recognized the proceeds from the private offering as restricted cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated financial statements. In connection with the offering, we incurred debt issuance costs of $9.7 million of which $0.5 million was incurred in 2016 and the remainder was incurred in 2017. The deferred costs associated with the Notes will begin amortizing in the first quarter of 2017.\nResults of Operations of the Company\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nOverview.

million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $521.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to the Acquisitions, as well as organic growth and the purchase of certain customer contracts.\nOn a constant currency basis using the average exchange rates in effect during the year ended December 31, 2015, revenue would have been higher by $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nCost of Telecommunications Services Provided\nCost of telecommunications services provided increased by $69.6 million, or 34.0%, from $204.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $274.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Consistent with our increase in revenue, the increase in cost of telecommunications services provided was principally driven by the Acquisitions, as well as organic growth and the purchase of certain customer contracts.\nOn a constant currency basis using the average exchange rates in effect during the year ended December 31, 2015, cost of telecommunications services provided would have been higher by $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOperating Expenses\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG&A expenses increased by $41.5 million, or 40.8%, from $101.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $143.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Cash compensation expense increased $23.4 million or 39.2% from $59.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $83.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the Acquisitions.\nNon-cash compensation expense increased by $7.9 million, or 100.3%, from $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 driven by (i) the recognition of share-based compensation for performance awards where the performance criteria have been met, (ii) certain shares issued to former employees of One Source which were accounted for as compensation, and (iii) an overall increase in quantity of employee equity awards. Transaction and integration costs decreased by $1.3 million, or 21.4% from $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Other SG&A expense increased $11.5 million, or 41.0%, from $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $39.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of the Acquisitions.\nSeverance, Restructuring and Other Exit Costs. Restructuring costs decreased by $11.8 million, or 93.1%, from $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $0.9 million for year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was due to the fact that we closed two large acquisitions in 2015 (One Source and MegaPath), compared to one small acquisition in 2016 (Telnes).\nDepreciation and Amortization. Amortization of intangible assets increased $14.7 million, or 56.5%, from $26.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $40.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to an increase in definite-lived intangible assets from the Acquisitions and the purchase of certain customer contracts. Depreciation expense increased by $1.4 million, or 6.8%, from $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the addition of property and equipment from the Acquisitions.\nOther Expense. Other expense increased by $13.1 million, or 70.7% from $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This is primarily attributed to higher interest expense related to increased debt levels to support acquisition activities.\nOn a constant currency basis using the average exchange rates in effect during the year ended December 31, 2015, operating expenses would have been higher by $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Selling, general and administrative expenses are the only operating expenses that would have been impacted by the change in exchange rates.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nRevenue\nOur revenue increased by $161.9 million, or 78.1%, from $207.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $369.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the Acquisitions completed in 2015.\nOn a constant currency basis using the average exchange rates in effect during the year ended December 31, 2014, revenue would have been higher by $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nCost of Telecommunications Services Provided\nCost of telecommunications services provided increased by $76.4 million, or 59.6%, from $128.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $204.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Consistent with our increase in revenue, the increase in cost of telecommunications services provided was principally driven by the Acquisitions.\nOn a constant currency basis using the average exchange rates in effect during the year ended December 31, 2014, cost of telecommunications services provided would have been higher by $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOperating Expenses\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG&A expenses increased by $56.1 million, or 123.0% from $45.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $101.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash compensation expense increased by $30.1 million, or 102.0%, from $29.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $59.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, due primarily to the Acquisitions. Non-cash compensation expense increased by $5.5 million, or 225.7%, from $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, driven by the recognition of share-based compensation for performance awards where the performance criteria have been met and an overall increase in the quantity of employee equity awards. Other SG&A expense increased $14.4 million, or 105.7%, from $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Transaction and integration was $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. There were no transition and integration costs incurred in 2014.\nSeverance, Restructuring and Other Exit Costs. Restructuring costs increased by $3.2 million, or 34.4% from $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $12.7 million for year ended December 31, 2015. The $12.7 million in 2015 is comprised of exit costs associated with the acquisition of One Source and MegaPath, and the $9.4 million in 2014 is comprised of $6.1 million of exit costs associated with the acquisition of UNSi and $3.3 million in litigation settlement.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Amortization of intangible assets increased $12.2 million, or 88.4%, from $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $26.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, due to the addition of definite-lived intangible assets from the Acquisitions. Similarly, depreciation expense increased $9.6 million, or 86.5%, from $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the addition of property and equipment from the Acquisitions.\nOther Expense. Other expense decreased by $1.7 million, or 8.2%, from $20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded $6.9 million of expense associated with the change in fair value of the warrant liability that was extinguished in the third quarter of 2014. This was offset by increased interest expense of $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, attributed to increased debt for the acquisitions during 2015.\nUsing constant currency, when compared to 2014, operating expense for year ended December 31, 2015, would have been $1.6 million higher than reported. Selling, general and administrative expenses are the only operating expenses that would have been impacted by the change in exchange rates.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d), from time to time we may use or publicly disclose certain \"non-GAAP financial measures\" in the course of our financial presentations, earnings releases, earnings conference calls, and otherwise. For these purposes, the SEC defines a \"non-GAAP financial measure\" as a numerical measure of historical or future financial performance, financial positions, or cash flows that (i) exclude amounts, or is subject to adjustments that effectively exclude amounts, included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in financial statements, and (ii) include amounts, or is subject to adjustments that effectively include amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional information to investors to provide an alternative method for assessing our financial condition and operating results. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when taken together with our GAAP financial measures, allow us and our investors to better evaluate our performance and profitability. These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP, and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial\nmeasures used by other companies. These measures should be used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP, and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures.\nPursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also generally present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure we reference with such comparable GAAP financial measure.\nAdjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ( Adjusted EBITDA\u201d)\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income/(loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") adjusted to exclude severance, restructuring and other exit costs, acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, losses on extinguishment of debt, share-based compensation, and from time to time, other non-cash or non-recurring items.\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate operating performance, and this financial measure is among the primary measures we use for planning and forecasting future periods. We further believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view results in a manner similar to the method used by management and makes it easier to compare our results with the results of other companies that have different financing and capital structures. In addition, we have debt covenants that are based on a leverage ratio that utilizes a modified EBITDA calculation, as defined in our credit agreement. The modified EBITDA calculation is similar to our definition of Adjusted EBITDA; however it includes the pro forma Adjusted EBITDA of and expected cost synergies from the companies acquired by us during the applicable reporting period. Finally, Adjusted EBITDA results, along with other quantitative and qualitative information, are utilized by management and our compensation committee for purposes of determining bonus payouts to our employees.\nAdjusted EBITDA Less Capital Expenditures\nAdjusted EBITDA less purchases of property and equipment, which we also refer to as capital expenditures or capex, is a performance measure that we use to evaluate the appropriate level of capital expenditures needed to support our expected revenue, and to provide a comparable view of our performance relative to other telecommunications companies who may utilize different strategies for providing access to fiber-based services and related infrastructure. We use a \"capex light\" strategy, which means we purchase fiber-based services and related infrastructure from other providers on an as-needed basis, pursuant to our customers' requirements. Many other telecommunications companies spend significant amounts of capital expenditures to construct their own fiber networks and data centers, and attempt to purchase as little as possible from other providers. As a result of our strategy, we typically have lower Adjusted EBITDA margins compared to other providers, but also spend much less on capital expenditures relative to our revenue. We believe it is important to take both of these factors into account when evaluating our performance.\nThe following is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures from Net Income (Loss):\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Unaudited)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(22,979\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for (benefit from) income taxes\n</td> <td>3,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34,131\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other expense, net\n</td> <td>30,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on debt extinguishment\n</td> <td>1,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>62,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Severance, restructuring and other exit costs\n</td> <td>870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction and integration costs\n</td> <td>4,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share-based compensation\n</td> <td>15,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>125,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchases of property and equipment\n</td> <td>(24,189\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,070\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,819\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations, equity offerings and debt financing. Our principal uses of cash have been for acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures, and debt service requirements. We anticipate that our principal uses of cash in the future will be for acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital, and debt service.\nManagement monitors cash flow and liquidity requirements on a regular basis, including an analysis of the anticipated working capital requirements for the next 12 months. This analysis assumes our ability to manage expenses, capital expenditures, indebtedness and the anticipated growth of revenue. If our operating performance differs significantly from our forecasts, we may be required to reduce our operating expenses and curtail capital spending, and we may not remain in compliance with our debt covenants. In addition, if we are unable to fully fund our cash requirements through operations and current cash on hand, we may need to obtain additional financing through a combination of equity and debt financings and/or renegotiation of terms of our existing debt. If any such activities become necessary, there can be no assurance that we would be successful in obtaining additional financing or modifying our existing debt terms.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $29.7 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, and our current assets were $23.0 million greater than current liabilities. Our current liabilities include $24.4 million of earn-outs and holdback obligations payable in 2017; and $3.2 million of accrued severance and exit costs with a substantial portion of this obligation expected to be paid in 2017. We believe that cash currently on hand, expected cash flows from future operations and existing borrowing capacity are sufficient to fund operations for at least the next 12 months.\nOur capital expenditures increased by $10.1 million, or 71.9%, from $14.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $24.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in capital expenditures was due to our growth, but remained less than 5% of revenue, consistent with our 'capex light' strategy. We anticipate that we will incur capital expenditures in the range of 6% to 7% of revenue in 2017, taking into consideration the recent acquisition of Hibernia Networks, which closed in January 2017. We continue to expect that our capital expenditures will be primarily success-based, i.e., in support of specific revenue opportunities.\nCashflows\nWe believe that our cash flows from operating activities, in addition to cash on-hand, will be sufficient to fund our operating activities and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future, and in any event for at least the next 12 to 18 months. However, no assurance can be given that this will be the case.\nThe following table summarizes the components of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Data\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,475\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(362,601\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(314,772\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(43,513\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>318,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>253,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Provided (or Used) by Operating Activities\nOur largest source of cash provided by operating activities is monthly recurring revenue from our customers. Our primary uses of cash are payments to network suppliers, compensation related costs and third-party vendors such as agents, contractors, and professional service providers.\nNet cash flows from operating activities increased by $35.9 million, or 145.6%, from $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $60.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, due primarily to the Acquisitions, as well as organic growth and the purchase of certain customer contracts. Net cash flows from operating activities increased by $31.1 million, or 480.7%, from a use of operating cash of $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to a source of operating cash of $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, also due primarily to the Acquisitions, as well as organic growth and the purchase of certain customer contracts.\nCash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 included $4.4 million cash paid for severance and exit costs, $4.8 million cash paid for transaction and integration costs and a working capital use of $29.5 million. The working capital use was driven by an effort to improve the timeliness of payments to our key vendors, and slower payment timing by some of our larger customers. We have several initiatives underway to improve payment timing from our customers, which we expect to take effect in 2017.\nCash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 includes $8.0 million cash paid for severance and exit costs, $6.1 million cash paid for transaction and integration costs, and a working capital use of $24.2 million.\nCash used by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2014 includes $4.8 million cash paid for severance and exit costs, and a working capital use of $23.8 million.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nOur primary uses of cash include acquisitions, purchase of customer contracts and capital expenditures.\nNet cash flows from investing activities increased by $47.8 million, or 15.2% from $314.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $362.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net cash flows from investing activities increased by $271.3 million, or 623.4%, from $43.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $314.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nCash used for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily consisted of $304.3 million for restricted cash that was deposited into escrow in anticipation of the Hibernia Networks acquisition that closed on January 9, 2017 (see Note 15 - Subsequent Events for details). We also completed the Telnes acquisition and certain customer contract purchases during 2016 for which we paid a total of approximately $34.1 million, in addition to capital expenditures of approximately $24.2 million.\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily consisted of $300.7 million of cash used for the acquisitions of One Source and MegaPath, in addition to capital expenditures of approximately $14.1 million.\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily consisted of $37.5 million of cash used for the acquisition of UNSi and capital expenditures of $5.8 million.\nCash Provided by Financing Activities\nOur primary source of cash for financing activities is debt financing proceeds. Our primary use of cash for financing activities is the refinancing of our debt and repayment of principal pursuant to the debt agreements.\nNet cash flows from financing activities increased by $65.1 million, or 25.7% from $253.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $318.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net cash flows from financing activities increased by $165.3 million, or 187.3%, from $88.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $253.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016, was $318.6 million consisting primarily of $300.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of senior notes to fund the Hibernia Networks acquisition that closed on January 9, 2017 (see Note 15 - Subsequent Events for details).\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015, was $253.5 million, which primarily consisted of net proceeds from the October 2015 Credit Agreement used to fund the acquisition of One Source.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014, was $88.2 million, which primarily consisted of $72.7 million from new equity raised and net debt proceeds of $29.4 million from the August 2014 Credit Agreement. For additional discussion of indebtedness, refer to Note 6 - Debt of the consolidated financial statements.\nOther cash flows\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we made cash payments for interest totaling $26.3 million, $13.1 million and $8.0 million, respectively. The increase in interest payments is a result of the incremental debt associated with the Acquisitions, as discussed further in Note 6 - Debt of the consolidated financial statements.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had contractual payment obligations of approximately $955.2 million.\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 (amounts in thousands):\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term loan\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>425,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>404,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>7.875% Senior Note\n</td> <td>300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving line of credit\n</td> <td>20,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>10,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>473\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital leases\n</td> <td>1,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Network supplier agreements (1)\n</td> <td>189,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (2)\n</td> <td>8,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>955,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>706,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Excludes contracts where the initial term has expired and we are currently in month-to-month status.\n(2) \"Other\" consists of vendor contracts associated with network monitoring and maintenance services.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nSubsequent Events\nHibernia Acquisition\nOn January 9, 2017, we acquired 100% of Hibernia Networks. We paid $621.5 million, comprised of $515.0 million in cash consideration, $14.6 million net cash acquired and 3,329,872 unregistered shares of our common stock, initially valued at $75.0 million on the date of announcement, and ultimately valued at $91.9 million at closing. The purchase price is subject to a final post-closing reconciliation for closing date cash, net working capital, transaction expenses, indebtedness, certain tax payments and prepaid customer contracts.\n$300.0 million of the cash consideration was funded by proceeds from the issuance of the 7.875% senior unsecured notes (\"Notes\"), which was funded into escrow in December 2016 (refer to Note 6 - Debt of the consolidated financial statements for further information). The remainder was funded by a new credit agreement, which is discussed in more detail below.\nThe Company expects the integration of Hibernia to be substantially complete by the end of the third quarter of 2017.\nCredit Agreement\nIn conjunction with the Hibernia acquisition, we closed on a new credit agreement (the \"2017 Credit Agreement\") on January 9, 2017. The 2017 Credit Agreement provides a $700.0 million term loan facility and a $75.0 million revolving line of credit facility. At our election, the loans under the 2017 Credit Agreement may be made as either Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Loans, with applicable margins at 3.00% and 4.00%, respectively. The Eurodollar Loans will be subject to a floor of 1.00%, and the applicable margin for revolving loans will be 2.50% for Base Rate Loans and 3.50% for Eurodollar Loans.\nThe maturity date of the term loan facility is January 9, 2024 and the maturity date of the revolving loan facility is January 9, 2022. The principal amount of the term loan facility is payable in equal quarterly installments of $1.75 million, commencing on March 31, 2017 and continuing thereafter until the maturity date, when the remaining balance of outstanding principal is payable in full. The revolving loan facility contains a maximum consolidated net secured leverage ratio when more than 30% is utilized.\nThe proceeds from the Notes and 2017 Credit Agreement were used to fund the Hibernia acquisition, repay existing indebtedness, pay various fees and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition and related financing transactions, and for general corporate purposes.\nFor additional details on our indebtedness, refer to Note 6 - Debt of the consolidated financial statements or the Liquidity and Capital Resources section included herein.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and the impact of such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements. Our critical accounting policies have been discussed with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, and believe that an understanding of these policies is important to a proper evaluation of the reported consolidated financial results. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on reported results of operations.\nSegment Reporting\nWe report operating results and financial data in one operating and reporting segment. The chief operating decision maker manages our business as a single profit center in order to promote collaboration, provide comprehensive service offerings across our entire customer base, and provide incentives to employees based on the success of the organization as a whole. Although certain information regarding selected products or services is discussed for purposes of promoting an understanding of our complex business, the chief operating decision maker manages our business and allocates resources at the consolidated level.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe deliver four primary services to our customers - flexible Ethernet-based wide area network services; high bandwidth Internet connectivity services; managed network services and security services; and global communication and collaboration services. Certain of our current commercial activities have features that may be considered multiple elements, specifically, when we sell Customer Premise Equipment (\"CPE\") in addition to our services. We believe that there is sufficient evidence to determine each element's fair\nvalue and, as a result, in those arrangements where there are multiple elements, the service revenue is recorded ratably over the term of the agreement and the equipment is accounted for as a sale, at the time of sale, as long as collectability is reasonably assured.\nOur services are provided under contracts that typically provide for an installation charge along with payments of recurring charges on a monthly basis for use of the services over a committed term. Our contracts with customers specify the terms and conditions for providing such services, including installation date, recurring and non-recurring fees, payment terms and length of term. These contracts call for us to provide the service in question (e.g., data transmission between point A and point Z), to manage the activation process, and to provide ongoing support (in the form of service maintenance and trouble-shooting) during the service term. The contracts do not typically provide the customer any rights to use specifically identifiable assets. Furthermore, the contracts generally provide us with discretion to engineer (or re-engineer) a particular network solution to satisfy each customer's data transmission requirement, and typically prohibit physical access by the customer to the network infrastructure used by us and our suppliers to deliver the services.\nWe recognize revenue as follows:\nMonthly Recurring Revenue. Monthly recurring revenue represents the substantial majority of our revenue, and consists of fees we charge for ongoing services that are generally fixed in price and billed on a recurring monthly basis (one month in advance) for a specified term. At the end of the term, most contracts provide for a continuation of services on the same terms, either for a specified renewal period (e.g., one year) or on a month-to-month basis. We record recurring revenue based on the fees agreed to in each contract, as long as the contract is in effect.\nUsage Revenue. Usage revenue represents variable charges for certain services, based on specific usage of those services, or usage above a fixed threshold, billed monthly in arrears. We record usage revenue based on actual usage charges billed using the rates and/or thresholds specified in each contract.\nNon-recurring Revenue. Non-recurring revenue consists of charges for installation in connection with the delivery of recurring communications services, late payments, cancellation fees, early termination fees and equipment sales. Fees billed for installation services are initially recorded as deferred revenue then recognized ratably over the contractual term of the recurring service. We believe that the contract term serves as the best estimate of the expected relationship term. Fees charged for late payments, cancellation (pre-installation) or early termination (post-installation) are typically fixed or determinable per the terms of the respective contract, and are recognized as revenue when billed. In addition, from time to time we sell communications and/or networking equipment to our customers in connection with our data networking services. We recognize revenue from the sale of equipment at the contracted selling price when title to the equipment passes to the customer (generally F.O.B. origin).\nWe record revenue only when collectability is reasonably assured, irrespective of the type of revenue.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe issue three types of grants under our share-based compensation plan, time-based restricted stock, time-based stock options, and performance-based restricted stock. The time-based restricted stock and stock options generally vest over a four-year period, contingent upon meeting the requisite service period requirement. Performance awards typically vest over a shorter period, e.g., two years, starting when the performance criteria established in the grant have been met.\nThe share price on the day of grant is used as the fair value for all restricted stock. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the estimated fair value for stock options. Critical inputs into the Black-Scholes option-pricing model include the following: option exercise price; fair value of the stock price; expected life of the option; annualized volatility of the stock; annual rate of quarterly dividends on the stock; and risk-free interest rate.\nImplied volatility is calculated as of each grant date based on our historical stock price volatility along with an assessment of a peer group. Other than the expected life of the option, volatility is the most sensitive input to our option grants. The risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model is determined by referencing the U.S. Treasury yield curve rates with the remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. Forfeitures are estimated based on our historical analysis of attrition levels. Forfeiture estimates are updated quarterly for actual forfeitures.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method pursuant to GAAP. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement\ncarrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period of the change. Further, deferred tax assets are recognized for the expected realization of available net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is recorded on gross deferred tax assets when it is \"more likely than not\" that such asset will not be realized. When evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets, all evidence, both positive and negative, is evaluated. Items considered in this analysis include the ability to carry back losses, the reversal of temporary differences, tax planning strategies and expectations of future earnings. We review our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine if a valuation allowance is required based upon these factors. Changes in our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance could give rise to a change in such allowance, potentially resulting in additional expense or benefit in the period of change.\nOur income tax provision includes U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes and is based on pre-tax income or loss. In determining the annual effective income tax rate, we analyzed various factors, including our annual earnings and taxing jurisdictions in which the earnings were generated, the impact of state and local income taxes and our ability to use tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards.\nUnder GAAP for income taxes, the amount of tax benefit to be recognized is the amount of benefit that is \"more likely than not\" to be sustained upon examination. We analyze our tax filing positions in all of the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns, as well as for all open tax years in these jurisdictions. If, based on this analysis, we determine that uncertainties in tax positions exist, a liability is established in the consolidated financial statements. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax positions in the provision for income taxes.\nEstimating Allowances and Accrued Liabilities\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe establish an allowance for bad debts for accounts receivable amounts that may not be collectible. We state our accounts receivable balances at amounts due from the customer net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. We determine this allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time receivables are past due, previous loss history and the customer's current ability to pay. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had an allowance for doubtful accounts of $2.7 million and $1.0 million, respectively.\nAllowance for Vendor Disputes\nIn the normal course of business, we identify errors by suppliers with respect to the billing of services. We perform bill verification procedures to ensure that errors in our suppliers' billed invoices are identified and resolved. If we conclude that a vendor has billed us inaccurately, we will record a liability only for the amount that we believe is owed. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $5.8 million and $6.9 million, respectively, in disputed billings from suppliers that were not accrued because we do not believe we owe them.\nDeferred Costs\nInstallation costs related to provisioning of recurring communications services that we incur from third-party suppliers, directly attributable and necessary to fulfill a particular service contract, and which costs would not have been incurred but for the occurrence of that service contract, are recorded as deferred contract costs and expensed ratably over the contractual term of service in the same manner as the deferred revenue arising from that contract. Based on historical experience, we believe the initial contractual term is the best estimate for the period of earnings. If any installation costs exceed the amount of corresponding deferred revenue, the excess cost is recognized in the current period.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe record the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination as goodwill. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually, in October, or more frequently if a triggering event occurs between impairment testing dates. We operate as a single operating segment and as a single reporting unit for the purpose of evaluating goodwill impairment. Our impairment assessment begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more like than not that fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. The qualitative assessment includes comparing our overall financial performance against the planned results used in the last quantitative goodwill impairment test. Additionally, we assess the fair value in light of certain events and circumstances, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and other relevant entity and Company specific events. The selection and assessment of qualitative factors used to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting units exceeds the carrying value involves significant judgments and estimates.\nIf it is determined under the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then a two-step quantitative impairment test is performed. Under the first step, we estimate the fair value compared with our carrying value (including goodwill). If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, step two does not need to be performed. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, an indication of goodwill impairments exists and we would need to perform step two of the impairment test. Under step two, an impairment loss would be recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of our goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The fair value under the two-step assessment is determined using a combination of both income and market-based approaches. There were no impairments identified for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nIntangible assets arising from business combinations, such as acquired customer contracts and relationships, (collectively \"customer relationships\"), trade names, intellectual property or know-how, are initially recorded at fair value. We amortize these intangible assets over the determined useful life which ranges from three to seven years. We review the intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. If the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between fair value and the carrying value of the asset. There were no impairments recognized for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.\nFurther information is available in Note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein.\nBusiness Combinations and Asset Acquisitions\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.\nWe recognize the purchase of assets and the assumption of liabilities as an asset acquisition, if the transaction does not constitute a business combination. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price is allocated on a relative fair value basis to the identifiable assets and liabilities. No goodwill is recorded in an asset acquisition.\nCritical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships and developed technology, discount rates and terminal values. Our estimate of fair value is based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but actual results may differ from estimates.\nOther estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as more fully discussed in Note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRevenue Recognition\nOn May 28, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which delays the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. The FASB also agreed to allow entities to choose to adopt the standard as of the original effective date. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. The guidance includes indicators to assist an entity in determining whether it controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to the customers. The new revenue recognition standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2018, with the option to adopt it in the first quarter of 2017. We currently anticipate adopting the new standard effective January 1, 2018. The new standard also permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the modified retrospective method). While we are still in the process of completing our analysis on the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, we are not aware of any material impact the new standard will have and we anticipate adopting the standard using the modified retrospective method. This assessment excludes the potential impact the acquisition of Hibernia Networks will have on our analysis. Refer to Note 15 - Subsequent Events to the consolidated financial statements for further details on the acquisition.\nLease Accounting\nOn February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which requires most leases (with the exception of leases with terms of less than one year) to be recognized on the balance sheet as an asset and a lease liability. Leases will be classified as an operating lease or a financing lease. Operating leases are expensed using the straight-line method, whereas financing leases will be treated similarly to a capital lease under the current standard. The new standard will be effective for annual and interim periods, within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, but early adoption is permitted. The new standard must be presented using the modified retrospective method beginning with the earliest comparative period presented. We are currently evaluating the effect of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nShare-Based Payment\nOn March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which was issued as part of the FASB's simplification initiative and cover such areas as (i) the recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies and the classification of those excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows, (ii) an accounting policy election for forfeitures to be estimated or account for when incurred, (iii) the amount an employer can withhold to cover income taxes and still qualify for equity classification, and (iv) the classification of those taxes paid on the statement of cash flows. This update is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, which will require us to adopt these provisions in the first quarter of 2017. This guidance will be applied either prospectively, retrospectively or using a modified retrospective transition method, depending on the specific area covered. We do not expect the new guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nClassification of Certain Cash Transactions\nOn August 26, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which is intended to reduce diversity in practice of how certain transactions are classified and presented in the statement of cash flows in accordance with ASC 230. The ASU amends or clarifies guidance on eight specific cash flow issues, some of which include classification on debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. The standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those periods. Early adoption is permitted, provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period. The guidance requires application using a retrospective transition method. We are currently evaluating the effect of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures but we do not expect the new guidance to have a material impact.\nStatement of Cash Flows - Restricted Cash\nOn November 17, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash, which clarifies the presentation requirements of restricted cash within the statement of cash flows. The changes in restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents during the period should be included in the beginning and ending cash and cash equivalents balance reconciliation on the statement of cash flows. When cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents are presented in more than one line item within the statement of financial position, an entity shall calculate a total cash amount in a narrative or tabular format that agrees to the amount shown on the statement of cash flows. Details on the nature and amounts of restricted cash should also be disclosed. This guidance will be effective in the first quarter of 2018 and early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the new guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nBusiness Combinations - Clarifying the Definition of a Business\nOn January 5, 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which clarifies the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. The standard introduces a screen for determining when assets acquired are not a business and clarifies that a business must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that contribute to an output to be considered a business. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. We do not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I am unable to comprehend the table you've provided me with.\n- Could you please clarify what it is you're asking me to do?\n\n- I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I understand your request.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Historical results may not indicate future performance. Our forward-looking statements reflect our current views about future events, are based on assumptions, and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Factors that may cause differences between actual results and those contemplated by forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in \"Risk Factors\" in Part I, Item 1A, of this Annual Report. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, including any changes that might result from any facts, events, or circumstances after the date hereof that may bear upon forward-looking statements. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee future results, events, levels of activity, performance, or achievements.\nThis MD&A is intended to assist in understanding and assessing the trends and significant changes in our results of operations and financial condition. As used in this MD&A, the words, \"we\", \"our\", and \"us\" refer to GTT Communications and its consolidated subsidiaries. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nCompany Overview\nGTT Communications, Inc. is a provider of cloud networking services to multinational clients. We offer a broad portfolio of global services including: WAN services; Internet services; managed network and security services; and voice and unified communication services.\nOur global Tier 1 IP network delivers connectivity for our clients around the world. We provide services to leading multinational enterprises, carriers and government customers in over 100 countries. We differentiate ourselves from our competition by delivering service to our clients with simplicity, speed and agility.\nWe deliver four primary service offerings to our customers:\n \u2022 WAN Services. We provide Layer 2 (Ethernet) and Layer 3 (MPLS) WAN solutions to meet the growing needs of multinational enterprises, carriers, service providers and content delivery networks regardless of location. We design and implement custom private, public and hybrid cloud network solutions for our customers, offering bandwidth speeds from 10 Mbps to 100 Gbps per port with burstable and aggregate bandwidth capabilities. All services are available on a protected basis with the ability to specify pre-configured alternate routes to minimize the impact of any network disruption. \n \u2022 Internet Services. We offer domestic and multinational customers scalable, high-bandwidth global Internet connectivity and IP transit with guaranteed availability and packet delivery. Our Internet services offer flexible connectivity with multiple port interfaces including Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, 10 Gigabit Ethernet and 100 Gigabit Ethernet. We also offer broadband and wireless access services. We support a dual stack of IPv4 and IPv6 protocols, enabling the delivery of seamless IPv6 services alongside existing IPv4 services. \n \u2022 Managed Services. We offer fully managed network services, including managed equipment, managed security services and managed remote access, enabling customers to focus on their core business. These end-to-end services cover the design, procurement, implementation, monitoring and maintenance of a customer's network. \n \u2022 Voice and Unified Communication Services. Our SIP Trunking service is an enterprise-built unified communications offering that integrates voice, video and chat onto a single IP connection, driving efficiency and productivity organization-wide. Our Enterprise PBX service allows clients to eliminate traditional voice infrastructure with communication services delivered through the cloud. The offering includes fully hosted and hybrid models for maximum flexibility. \nOur customer contracts are generally for initial terms of three years, with some contracts at one year, and others at five years or more. Following the initial terms, these agreements typically provide for automatic renewal for specified periods ranging from one month to one year. Our prices are fixed for the duration of the contract, and we typically bill monthly in advance for such services. If a customer terminates its agreement, the terms of the Company's customer contracts typically require full recovery of any amounts due for the remainder of the term or, at a minimum, our liability to any underlying suppliers.\nOur revenue is composed of three primary categories that include monthly recurring revenue (or \"MRR\"), non-recurring revenue and usage revenue. MRR relates to contracted ongoing service that is generally fixed in price and paid by the customer on a monthly basis for the contracted term. For the year ended December 31, 2016, MRR was approximately 91% of our revenue. Non-recurring revenue primarily includes the amortization of previously collected installation and equipment charges to customers, and one-time termination charges for customers who cancel their services prior to the contract termination date. Usage revenue represents variable revenue based on whether a customer exceeds its committed usage threshold as specified in the contract.\nOur network supplier contracts do not have any market related net settlement provisions. We have not entered into, and do not plan to enter into, any supplier contracts that involve financial or derivative instruments. The supplier contracts are entered into solely for the direct purchase of telecommunications capacity, which is resold by us in the normal course of business.\nOther than cost of telecommunications services provided, our most significant operating expenses are employment costs. As of December 31, 2016, we had 662 full-time equivalent employees. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the employee cash compensation and benefits represented approximately 16% of revenue.\nFactors Affecting Our Results of Operations\nBusiness Acquisitions\nSince our formation, we have consummated a number of transactions accounted for as business combinations which were executed as part of our strategy of expanding through acquisitions. These acquisitions, which are in addition to our periodic purchases of customer contracts, have allowed us to increase the scale at which we operate which in turn affords us the ability to increase our operating leverage, extend our network, and broaden our customer base.The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the operations of the acquired entities from their respective acquisition dates. The acquisitions noted below are collectively defined as \"Acquisitions\" for purposes of explaining our results of operations.\nTelnes\nIn February 2016, we completed the acquisition of Telnes Broadband (\"Telnes\"). We paid $15.5 million in cash and issued 178,202 unregistered shares of our common stock valued at $2.0 million.\nOne Source\nIn October 2015, we completed the acquisition of One Source Networks Inc. (\"One Source\"). We paid $169.3 million in cash and issued 185,946 unregistered shares of our common stock valued at $2.3 million. We also issued 289,055 unregistered shares of our common stock to certain One Source employees as compensation for continuous employment valued at $3.6 million.\nMegaPath\nIn April 2015, we acquired MegaPath Corporation (\"MegaPath\"). We paid $141.4 million in cash (exclusive of the assumption of $3.4 million in capital leases), and issued 610,843 unregistered shares of our common stock valued at $7.5 million.\nUNSi\nIn October 2014, we acquired United Networks Services, Inc. (\"UNSi\"). We paid $32.5 million in cash and issued 231,539 of unregistered shares of our common stock valued at $2.9 million.\nAsset Purchases\nPeriodically we acquire customer contracts that we account for as an asset purchase and record a corresponding intangible asset that is amortized over its assumed useful life. During 2016 we acquired two portfolios of customer contracts for an aggregate purchase price of $41.3 million, of which $20 million was paid in 2016 at the respective closing dates. The remaining $21.3 million will be paid in 2017. We did not have any material asset purchases in 2015 or 2014, respectively.\nIndebtedness\nThe following summarizes our long-term debt at December 31, 2016 and 2015 (amounts in thousands):\n\nOctober 2015 Credit Agreement\nIn October 2015, we entered into a credit agreement (the October 2015 Credit Agreement\u201d) that provided for a $400.0 million term loan facility and a $50.0 million revolving line of credit facility (which includes a $15.0 million letter of credit facility and a $10.0 million swingline facility). The term loan facility was issued at a discount of $8.0 million. The maturity date of the term loan facility is October 22, 2022, and the maturity date of the revolving line of credit is October 22, 2020.\nOn May 3, 2016, we entered into an incremental term loan agreement that increased outstanding term loans by $30.0 million, the proceeds of which were used to repay the then outstanding revolving loans.\nOn June 28, 2016, we entered into Amendment No. 1 (the \"Repricing Amendment\") to the October 2015 Credit Agreement. The Repricing Amendment, among other things, reduced the applicable rate for term loans to LIBOR plus 4.75% (subject to a LIBOR floor of 1.00%) and reduced the applicable rate for revolving loans to LIBOR plus 4.25% (with no LIBOR floor).\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had drawn $20.0 million under the revolving line of credit and had $29.5 million of available borrowing capacity. Approximately $0.5 million of the revolving line of credit was utilized for outstanding letters of credit relating to our real estate lease obligations.\nOur obligations under the October 2015 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets. We were in compliance with all financial covenants under the October 2015 Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2016.\nThe effective interest rate on outstanding debt at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was 5.76% and 6.24% respectively.\n7.875% Senior Unsecured Notes\nOn December 22, 2016, in connection with the pending acquisitions of Hibernia Networks, we completed a private offering of $300 million aggregate principal amount of 7.875% senior unsecured notes due in 2024 (the \"Notes\"). The proceeds of the private offering were deposited into escrow, where the funds remained until all the escrow release conditions were satisfied, most notably the closing of the acquisition of Hibernia Networks on January 9, 2017. Had the acquisition agreement been terminated, the funds in escrow would have been released and returned to the investors of the Notes, including accrued and unpaid interest up to the date of release. We have recognized the proceeds from the private offering as restricted cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated financial statements. In connection with the offering, we incurred debt issuance costs of $9.7 million of which $0.5 million was incurred in 2016 and the remainder was incurred in 2017. The deferred costs associated with the Notes will begin amortizing in the first quarter of 2017.\nResults of Operations of the Company\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nOverview. The information presented in the tables below is composed of the consolidated financial information for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (amounts in thousands):\n\n* Not meaningful\nThe following table supplements the information presented above for selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 (amounts in thousands):\n\n(1) Includes professional fees, marketing costs, facilities and other general support costs.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nRevenue\nOur revenue increased by $152.4 million, or 41.3%, from $369.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $521.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to the Acquisitions, as well as organic growth and the purchase of certain customer contracts.\nOn a constant currency basis using the average exchange rates in effect during the year ended December 31, 2015, revenue would have been higher by $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nCost of Telecommunications Services Provided\nCost of telecommunications services provided increased by $69.6 million, or 34.0%, from $204.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $274.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Consistent with our increase in revenue, the increase in cost of telecommunications services provided was principally driven by the Acquisitions, as well as organic growth and the purchase of certain customer contracts.\nOn a constant currency basis using the average exchange rates in effect during the year ended December 31, 2015, cost of telecommunications services provided would have been higher by $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOperating Expenses\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG&A expenses increased by $41.5 million, or 40.8%, from $101.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $143.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Cash compensation expense increased $23.4 million or 39.2% from $59.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $83.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the Acquisitions.\nNon-cash compensation expense increased by $7.9 million, or 100.3%, from $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 driven by (i) the recognition of share-based compensation for performance awards where the performance criteria have been met, (ii) certain shares issued to former employees of One Source which were accounted for as compensation, and (iii) an overall increase in quantity of employee equity awards. Transaction and integration costs decreased by $1.3 million, or 21.4% from $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Other SG&A expense increased $11.5 million, or 41.0%, from $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $39.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of the Acquisitions.\nSeverance, Restructuring and Other Exit Costs. Restructuring costs decreased by $11.8 million, or 93.1%, from $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $0.9 million for year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was due to the fact that we closed two large acquisitions in 2015 (One Source and MegaPath), compared to one small acquisition in 2016 (Telnes).\nDepreciation and Amortization. Amortization of intangible assets increased $14.7 million, or 56.5%, from $26.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $40.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to an increase in definite-lived intangible assets from the Acquisitions and the purchase of certain customer contracts. Depreciation expense increased by $1.4 million, or 6.8%, from $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the addition of property and equipment from the Acquisitions.\nOther Expense. Other expense increased by $13.1 million, or 70.7% from $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This is primarily attributed to higher interest expense related to increased debt levels to support acquisition activities.\nOn a constant currency basis using the average exchange rates in effect during the year ended December 31, 2015, operating expenses would have been higher by $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Selling, general and administrative expenses are the only operating expenses that would have been impacted by the change in exchange rates.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nRevenue\nOur revenue increased by $161.9 million, or 78.1%, from $207.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $369.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the Acquisitions completed in 2015.\nOn a constant currency basis using the average exchange rates in effect during the year ended December 31, 2014, revenue would have been higher by $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nCost of Telecommunications Services Provided\nCost of telecommunications services provided increased by $76.4 million, or 59.6%, from $128.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $204.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Consistent with our increase in revenue, the increase in cost of telecommunications services provided was principally driven by the Acquisitions.\nOn a constant currency basis using the average exchange rates in effect during the year ended December 31, 2014, cost of telecommunications services provided would have been higher by $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOperating Expenses\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG&A expenses increased by $56.1 million, or 123.0% from $45.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $101.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash compensation expense increased by $30.1 million, or 102.0%, from $29.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $59.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, due primarily to the Acquisitions. Non-cash compensation expense increased by $5.5 million, or 225.7%, from $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, driven by the recognition of share-based compensation for performance awards where the performance criteria have been met and an overall increase in the quantity of employee equity awards. Other SG&A expense increased $14.4 million, or 105.7%, from $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Transaction and integration was $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. There were no transition and integration costs incurred in 2014.\nSeverance, Restructuring and Other Exit Costs. Restructuring costs increased by $3.2 million, or 34.4% from $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $12.7 million for year ended December 31, 2015. The $12.7 million in 2015 is comprised of exit costs associated with the acquisition of One Source and MegaPath, and the $9.4 million in 2014 is comprised of $6.1 million of exit costs associated with the acquisition of UNSi and $3.3 million in litigation settlement.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Amortization of intangible assets increased $12.2 million, or 88.4%, from $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $26.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, due to the addition of definite-lived intangible assets from the Acquisitions. Similarly, depreciation expense increased $9.6 million, or 86.5%, from $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the addition of property and equipment from the Acquisitions.\nOther Expense. Other expense decreased by $1.7 million, or 8.2%, from $20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded $6.9 million of expense associated with the change in fair value of the warrant liability that was extinguished in the third quarter of 2014. This was offset by increased interest expense of $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, attributed to increased debt for the acquisitions during 2015.\nUsing constant currency, when compared to 2014, operating expense for year ended December 31, 2015, would have been $1.6 million higher than reported. Selling, general and administrative expenses are the only operating expenses that would have been impacted by the change in exchange rates.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d), from time to time we may use or publicly disclose certain \"non-GAAP financial measures\" in the course of our financial presentations, earnings releases, earnings conference calls, and otherwise. For these purposes, the SEC defines a \"non-GAAP financial measure\" as a numerical measure of historical or future financial performance, financial positions, or cash flows that (i) exclude amounts, or is subject to adjustments that effectively exclude amounts, included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in financial statements, and (ii) include amounts, or is subject to adjustments that effectively include amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional information to investors to provide an alternative method for assessing our financial condition and operating results. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when taken together with our GAAP financial measures, allow us and our investors to better evaluate our performance and profitability. These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP, and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial\nmeasures used by other companies. These measures should be used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP, and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures.\nPursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also generally present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure we reference with such comparable GAAP financial measure.\nAdjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ( Adjusted EBITDA\u201d)\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income/(loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") adjusted to exclude severance, restructuring and other exit costs, acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, losses on extinguishment of debt, share-based compensation, and from time to time, other non-cash or non-recurring items.\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate operating performance, and this financial measure is among the primary measures we use for planning and forecasting future periods. We further believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view results in a manner similar to the method used by management and makes it easier to compare our results with the results of other companies that have different financing and capital structures. In addition, we have debt covenants that are based on a leverage ratio that utilizes a modified EBITDA calculation, as defined in our credit agreement. The modified EBITDA calculation is similar to our definition of Adjusted EBITDA; however it includes the pro forma Adjusted EBITDA of and expected cost synergies from the companies acquired by us during the applicable reporting period. Finally, Adjusted EBITDA results, along with other quantitative and qualitative information, are utilized by management and our compensation committee for purposes of determining bonus payouts to our employees.\nAdjusted EBITDA Less Capital Expenditures\nAdjusted EBITDA less purchases of property and equipment, which we also refer to as capital expenditures or capex, is a performance measure that we use to evaluate the appropriate level of capital expenditures needed to support our expected revenue, and to provide a comparable view of our performance relative to other telecommunications companies who may utilize different strategies for providing access to fiber-based services and related infrastructure. We use a \"capex light\" strategy, which means we purchase fiber-based services and related infrastructure from other providers on an as-needed basis, pursuant to our customers' requirements. Many other telecommunications companies spend significant amounts of capital expenditures to construct their own fiber networks and data centers, and attempt to purchase as little as possible from other providers. As a result of our strategy, we typically have lower Adjusted EBITDA margins compared to other providers, but also spend much less on capital expenditures relative to our revenue. We believe it is important to take both of these factors into account when evaluating our performance.\nThe following is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures from Net Income (Loss):\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations, equity offerings and debt financing. Our principal uses of cash have been for acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures, and debt service requirements. We anticipate that our principal uses of cash in the future will be for acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital, and debt service.\nManagement monitors cash flow and liquidity requirements on a regular basis, including an analysis of the anticipated working capital requirements for the next 12 months. This analysis assumes our ability to manage expenses, capital expenditures, indebtedness and the anticipated growth of revenue. If our operating performance differs significantly from our forecasts, we may be required to reduce our operating expenses and curtail capital spending, and we may not remain in compliance with our debt covenants. In addition, if we are unable to fully fund our cash requirements through operations and current cash on hand, we may need to obtain additional financing through a combination of equity and debt financings and/or renegotiation of terms of our existing debt. If any such activities become necessary, there can be no assurance that we would be successful in obtaining additional financing or modifying our existing debt terms.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $29.7 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, and our current assets were $23.0 million greater than current liabilities. Our current liabilities include $24.4 million of earn-outs and holdback obligations payable in 2017; and $3.2 million of accrued severance and exit costs with a substantial portion of this obligation expected to be paid in 2017. We believe that cash currently on hand, expected cash flows from future operations and existing borrowing capacity are sufficient to fund operations for at least the next 12 months.\nOur capital expenditures increased by $10.1 million, or 71.9%, from $14.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $24.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in capital expenditures was due to our growth, but remained less than 5% of revenue, consistent with our 'capex light' strategy. We anticipate that we will incur capital expenditures in the range of 6% to 7% of revenue in 2017, taking into consideration the recent acquisition of Hibernia Networks, which closed in January 2017. We continue to expect that our capital expenditures will be primarily success-based, i.e., in support of specific revenue opportunities.\nCashflows\nWe believe that our cash flows from operating activities, in addition to cash on-hand, will be sufficient to fund our operating activities and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future, and in any event for at least the next 12 to 18 months. However, no assurance can be given that this will be the case.\nThe following table summarizes the components of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\n\nCash Provided (or Used) by Operating Activities\nOur largest source of cash provided by operating activities is monthly recurring revenue from our customers. Our primary uses of cash are payments to network suppliers, compensation related costs and third-party vendors such as agents, contractors, and professional service providers.\nNet cash flows from operating activities increased by $35.9 million, or 145.6%, from $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $60.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, due primarily to the Acquisitions, as well as organic growth and the purchase of certain customer contracts. Net cash flows from operating activities increased by $31.1 million, or 480.7%, from a use of operating cash of $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to a source of operating cash of $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, also due primarily to the Acquisitions, as well as organic growth and the purchase of certain customer contracts.\nCash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 included $4.4 million cash paid for severance and exit costs, $4.8 million cash paid for transaction and integration costs and a working capital use of $29.5 million. The working capital use was driven by an effort to improve the timeliness of payments to our key vendors, and slower payment timing by some of our larger customers. We have several initiatives underway to improve payment timing from our customers, which we expect to take effect in 2017.\nCash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 includes $8.0 million cash paid for severance and exit costs, $6.1 million cash paid for transaction and integration costs, and a working capital use of $24.2 million.\nCash used by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2014 includes $4.8 million cash paid for severance and exit costs, and a working capital use of $23.8 million.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nOur primary uses of cash include acquisitions, purchase of customer contracts and capital expenditures.\nNet cash flows from investing activities increased by $47.8 million, or 15.2% from $314.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $362.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net cash flows from investing activities increased by $271.3 million, or 623.4%, from $43.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $314.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nCash used for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily consisted of $304.3 million for restricted cash that was deposited into escrow in anticipation of the Hibernia Networks acquisition that closed on January 9, 2017 (see Note 15 - Subsequent Events for details). We also completed the Telnes acquisition and certain customer contract purchases during 2016 for which we paid a total of approximately $34.1 million, in addition to capital expenditures of approximately $24.2 million.\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily consisted of $300.7 million of cash used for the acquisitions of One Source and MegaPath, in addition to capital expenditures of approximately $14.1 million.\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily consisted of $37.5 million of cash used for the acquisition of UNSi and capital expenditures of $5.8 million.\nCash Provided by Financing Activities\nOur primary source of cash for financing activities is debt financing proceeds. Our primary use of cash for financing activities is the refinancing of our debt and repayment of principal pursuant to the debt agreements.\nNet cash flows from financing activities increased by $65.1 million, or 25.7% from $253.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $318.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net cash flows from financing activities increased by $165.3 million, or 187.3%, from $88.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $253.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016, was $318.6 million consisting primarily of $300.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of senior notes to fund the Hibernia Networks acquisition that closed on January 9, 2017 (see Note 15 - Subsequent Events for details).\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015, was $253.5 million, which primarily consisted of net proceeds from the October 2015 Credit Agreement used to fund the acquisition of One Source.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014, was $88.2 million, which primarily consisted of $72.7 million from new equity raised and net debt proceeds of $29.4 million from the August 2014 Credit Agreement. For additional discussion of indebtedness, refer to Note 6 - Debt of the consolidated financial statements.\nOther cash flows\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we made cash payments for interest totaling $26.3 million, $13.1 million and $8.0 million, respectively. The increase in interest payments is a result of the incremental debt associated with the Acquisitions, as discussed further in Note 6 - Debt of the consolidated financial statements.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had contractual payment obligations of approximately $955.2 million.\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 (amounts in thousands):\n\n(1)Excludes contracts where the initial term has expired and we are currently in month-to-month status.\n(2) \"Other\" consists of vendor contracts associated with network monitoring and maintenance services.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nSubsequent Events\nHibernia Acquisition\nOn January 9, 2017, we acquired 100% of Hibernia Networks. We paid $621.5 million, comprised of $515.0 million in cash consideration, $14.6 million net cash acquired and 3,329,872 unregistered shares of our common stock, initially valued at $75.0 million on the date of announcement, and ultimately valued at $91.9 million at closing. The purchase price is subject to a final post-closing reconciliation for closing date cash, net working capital, transaction expenses, indebtedness, certain tax payments and prepaid customer contracts.\n$300.0 million of the cash consideration was funded by proceeds from the issuance of the 7.875% senior unsecured notes (\"Notes\"), which was funded into escrow in December 2016 (refer to Note 6 - Debt of the consolidated financial statements for further information). The remainder was funded by a new credit agreement, which is discussed in more detail below.\nThe Company expects the integration of Hibernia to be substantially complete by the end of the third quarter of 2017.\nCredit Agreement\nIn conjunction with the Hibernia acquisition, we closed on a new credit agreement (the \"2017 Credit Agreement\") on January 9, 2017. The 2017 Credit Agreement provides a $700.0 million term loan facility and a $75.0 million revolving line of credit facility. At our election, the loans under the 2017 Credit Agreement may be made as either Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Loans, with applicable margins at 3.00% and 4.00%, respectively. The Eurodollar Loans will be subject to a floor of 1.00%, and the applicable margin for revolving loans will be 2.50% for Base Rate Loans and 3.50% for Eurodollar Loans.\nThe maturity date of the term loan facility is January 9, 2024 and the maturity date of the revolving loan facility is January 9, 2022. The principal amount of the term loan facility is payable in equal quarterly installments of $1.75 million, commencing on March 31, 2017 and continuing thereafter until the maturity date, when the remaining balance of outstanding principal is payable in full. The revolving loan facility contains a maximum consolidated net secured leverage ratio when more than 30% is utilized.\nThe proceeds from the Notes and 2017 Credit Agreement were used to fund the Hibernia acquisition, repay existing indebtedness, pay various fees and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition and related financing transactions, and for general corporate purposes.\nFor additional details on our indebtedness, refer to Note 6 - Debt of the consolidated financial statements or the Liquidity and Capital Resources section included herein.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and the impact of such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements. Our critical accounting policies have been discussed with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, and believe that an understanding of these policies is important to a proper evaluation of the reported consolidated financial results. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on reported results of operations.\nSegment Reporting\nWe report operating results and financial data in one operating and reporting segment. The chief operating decision maker manages our business as a single profit center in order to promote collaboration, provide comprehensive service offerings across our entire customer base, and provide incentives to employees based on the success of the organization as a whole. Although certain information regarding selected products or services is discussed for purposes of promoting an understanding of our complex business, the chief operating decision maker manages our business and allocates resources at the consolidated level.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe deliver four primary services to our customers - flexible Ethernet-based wide area network services; high bandwidth Internet connectivity services; managed network services and security services; and global communication and collaboration services. Certain of our current commercial activities have features that may be considered multiple elements, specifically, when we sell Customer Premise Equipment (\"CPE\") in addition to our services. We believe that there is sufficient evidence to determine each element's fair\nvalue and, as a result, in those arrangements where there are multiple elements, the service revenue is recorded ratably over the term of the agreement and the equipment is accounted for as a sale, at the time of sale, as long as collectability is reasonably assured.\nOur services are provided under contracts that typically provide for an installation charge along with payments of recurring charges on a monthly basis for use of the services over a committed term. Our contracts with customers specify the terms and conditions for providing such services, including installation date, recurring and non-recurring fees, payment terms and length of term. These contracts call for us to provide the service in question (e.g., data transmission between point A and point Z), to manage the activation process, and to provide ongoing support (in the form of service maintenance and trouble-shooting) during the service term. The contracts do not typically provide the customer any rights to use specifically identifiable assets. Furthermore, the contracts generally provide us with discretion to engineer (or re-engineer) a particular network solution to satisfy each customer's data transmission requirement, and typically prohibit physical access by the customer to the network infrastructure used by us and our suppliers to deliver the services.\nWe recognize revenue as follows:\nMonthly Recurring Revenue. Monthly recurring revenue represents the substantial majority of our revenue, and consists of fees we charge for ongoing services that are generally fixed in price and billed on a recurring monthly basis (one month in advance) for a specified term. At the end of the term, most contracts provide for a continuation of services on the same terms, either for a specified renewal period (e.g., one year) or on a month-to-month basis. We record recurring revenue based on the fees agreed to in each contract, as long as the contract is in effect.\nUsage Revenue. Usage revenue represents variable charges for certain services, based on specific usage of those services, or usage above a fixed threshold, billed monthly in arrears. We record usage revenue based on actual usage charges billed using the rates and/or thresholds specified in each contract.\nNon-recurring Revenue. Non-recurring revenue consists of charges for installation in connection with the delivery of recurring communications services, late payments, cancellation fees, early termination fees and equipment sales. Fees billed for installation services are initially recorded as deferred revenue then recognized ratably over the contractual term of the recurring service. We believe that the contract term serves as the best estimate of the expected relationship term. Fees charged for late payments, cancellation (pre-installation) or early termination (post-installation) are typically fixed or determinable per the terms of the respective contract, and are recognized as revenue when billed. In addition, from time to time we sell communications and/or networking equipment to our customers in connection with our data networking services. We recognize revenue from the sale of equipment at the contracted selling price when title to the equipment passes to the customer (generally F.O.B. origin).\nWe record revenue only when collectability is reasonably assured, irrespective of the type of revenue.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe issue three types of grants under our share-based compensation plan, time-based restricted stock, time-based stock options, and performance-based restricted stock. The time-based restricted stock and stock options generally vest over a four-year period, contingent upon meeting the requisite service period requirement. Performance awards typically vest over a shorter period, e.g., two years, starting when the performance criteria established in the grant have been met.\nThe share price on the day of grant is used as the fair value for all restricted stock. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the estimated fair value for stock options. Critical inputs into the Black-Scholes option-pricing model include the following: option exercise price; fair value of the stock price; expected life of the option; annualized volatility of the stock; annual rate of quarterly dividends on the stock; and risk-free interest rate.\nImplied volatility is calculated as of each grant date based on our historical stock price volatility along with an assessment of a peer group. Other than the expected life of the option, volatility is the most sensitive input to our option grants. The risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model is determined by referencing the U.S. Treasury yield curve rates with the remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. Forfeitures are estimated based on our historical analysis of attrition levels. Forfeiture estimates are updated quarterly for actual forfeitures.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method pursuant to GAAP. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement\ncarrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period of the change. Further, deferred tax assets are recognized for the expected realization of available net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is recorded on gross deferred tax assets when it is \"more likely than not\" that such asset will not be realized. When evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets, all evidence, both positive and negative, is evaluated. Items considered in this analysis include the ability to carry back losses, the reversal of temporary differences, tax planning strategies and expectations of future earnings. We review our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine if a valuation allowance is required based upon these factors. Changes in our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance could give rise to a change in such allowance, potentially resulting in additional expense or benefit in the period of change.\nOur income tax provision includes U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes and is based on pre-tax income or loss. In determining the annual effective income tax rate, we analyzed various factors, including our annual earnings and taxing jurisdictions in which the earnings were generated, the impact of state and local income taxes and our ability to use tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards.\nUnder GAAP for income taxes, the amount of tax benefit to be recognized is the amount of benefit that is \"more likely than not\" to be sustained upon examination. We analyze our tax filing positions in all of the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns, as well as for all open tax years in these jurisdictions. If, based on this analysis, we determine that uncertainties in tax positions exist, a liability is established in the consolidated financial statements. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax positions in the provision for income taxes.\nEstimating Allowances and Accrued Liabilities\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe establish an allowance for bad debts for accounts receivable amounts that may not be collectible. We state our accounts receivable balances at amounts due from the customer net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. We determine this allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time receivables are past due, previous loss history and the customer's current ability to pay. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had an allowance for doubtful accounts of $2.7 million and $1.0 million, respectively.\nAllowance for Vendor Disputes\nIn the normal course of business, we identify errors by suppliers with respect to the billing of services. We perform bill verification procedures to ensure that errors in our suppliers' billed invoices are identified and resolved. If we conclude that a vendor has billed us inaccurately, we will record a liability only for the amount that we believe is owed. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $5.8 million and $6.9 million, respectively, in disputed billings from suppliers that were not accrued because we do not believe we owe them.\nDeferred Costs\nInstallation costs related to provisioning of recurring communications services that we incur from third-party suppliers, directly attributable and necessary to fulfill a particular service contract, and which costs would not have been incurred but for the occurrence of that service contract, are recorded as deferred contract costs and expensed ratably over the contractual term of service in the same manner as the deferred revenue arising from that contract. Based on historical experience, we believe the initial contractual term is the best estimate for the period of earnings. If any installation costs exceed the amount of corresponding deferred revenue, the excess cost is recognized in the current period.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe record the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination as goodwill. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually, in October, or more frequently if a triggering event occurs between impairment testing dates. We operate as a single operating segment and as a single reporting unit for the purpose of evaluating goodwill impairment. Our impairment assessment begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more like than not that fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. The qualitative assessment includes comparing our overall financial performance against the planned results used in the last quantitative goodwill impairment test. Additionally, we assess the fair value in light of certain events and circumstances, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and other relevant entity and Company specific events. The selection and assessment of qualitative factors used to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting units exceeds the carrying value involves significant judgments and estimates.\nIf it is determined under the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then a two-step quantitative impairment test is performed. Under the first step, we estimate the fair value compared with our carrying value (including goodwill). If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, step two does not need to be performed. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, an indication of goodwill impairments exists and we would need to perform step two of the impairment test. Under step two, an impairment loss would be recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of our goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The fair value under the two-step assessment is determined using a combination of both income and market-based approaches. There were no impairments identified for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nIntangible assets arising from business combinations, such as acquired customer contracts and relationships, (collectively \"customer relationships\"), trade names, intellectual property or know-how, are initially recorded at fair value. We amortize these intangible assets over the determined useful life which ranges from three to seven years. We review the intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. If the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between fair value and the carrying value of the asset. There were no impairments recognized for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.\nFurther information is available in Note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein.\nBusiness Combinations and Asset Acquisitions\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.\nWe recognize the purchase of assets and the assumption of liabilities as an asset acquisition, if the transaction does not constitute a business combination. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price is allocated on a relative fair value basis to the identifiable assets and liabilities. No goodwill is recorded in an asset acquisition.\nCritical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships and developed technology, discount rates and terminal values. Our estimate of fair value is based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but actual results may differ from estimates.\nOther estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as more fully discussed in Note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRevenue Recognition\nOn May 28, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which delays the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. The FASB also agreed to allow entities to choose to adopt the standard as of the original effective date. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. The guidance includes indicators to assist an entity in determining whether it controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to the customers. The new revenue recognition standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2018, with the option to adopt it in the first quarter of 2017. We currently anticipate adopting the new standard effective January 1, 2018. The new standard also permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the modified retrospective method). While we are still in the process of completing our analysis on the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, we are not aware of any material impact the new standard will have and we anticipate adopting the standard using the modified retrospective method. This assessment excludes the potential impact the acquisition of Hibernia Networks will have on our analysis. Refer to Note 15 - Subsequent Events to the consolidated financial statements for further details on the acquisition.\nLease Accounting\nOn February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which requires most leases (with the exception of leases with terms of less than one year) to be recognized on the balance sheet as an asset and a lease liability. Leases will be classified as an operating lease or a financing lease. Operating leases are expensed using the straight-line method, whereas financing leases will be treated similarly to a capital lease under the current standard. The new standard will be effective for annual and interim periods, within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, but early adoption is permitted. The new standard must be presented using the modified retrospective method beginning with the earliest comparative period presented. We are currently evaluating the effect of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nShare-Based Payment\nOn March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which was issued as part of the FASB's simplification initiative and cover such areas as (i) the recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies and the classification of those excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows, (ii) an accounting policy election for forfeitures to be estimated or account for when incurred, (iii) the amount an employer can withhold to cover income taxes and still qualify for equity classification, and (iv) the classification of those taxes paid on the statement of cash flows. This update is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, which will require us to adopt these provisions in the first quarter of 2017. This guidance will be applied either prospectively, retrospectively or using a modified retrospective transition method, depending on the specific area covered. We do not expect the new guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nClassification of Certain Cash Transactions\nOn August 26, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which is intended to reduce diversity in practice of how certain transactions are classified and presented in the statement of cash flows in accordance with ASC 230. The ASU amends or clarifies guidance on eight specific cash flow issues, some of which include classification on debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. The standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those periods. Early adoption is permitted, provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period. The guidance requires application using a retrospective transition method. We are currently evaluating the effect of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures but we do not expect the new guidance", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Historical results may not indicate future performance. Our forward-looking statements reflect our current views about future events, are based on assumptions, and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Factors that may cause differences between actual results and those contemplated by forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in \"Risk Factors\" in Part I, Item 1A, of this Annual Report. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, including any changes that might result from any facts, events, or circumstances after the date hereof that may bear upon forward-looking statements. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee future results, events, levels of activity, performance, or achievements.\nThis MD&A is intended to assist in understanding and assessing the trends and significant changes in our results of operations and financial condition. As used in this MD&A, the words, \"we\", \"our\", and \"us\" refer to GTT Communications and its consolidated subsidiaries. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nCompany Overview\nGTT Communications, Inc. is a provider of cloud networking services to multinational clients. We offer a broad portfolio of global services including: WAN services; Internet services; managed network and security services; and voice and unified communication services.\nOur global Tier 1 IP network delivers connectivity for our clients around the world. We provide services to leading multinational enterprises, carriers and government customers in over 100 countries. We differentiate ourselves from our competition by delivering service to our clients with simplicity, speed and agility.\nWe deliver four primary service offerings to our customers:\n \u2022 WAN Services. We provide Layer 2 (Ethernet) and Layer 3 (MPLS) WAN solutions to meet the growing needs of multinational enterprises, carriers, service providers and content delivery networks regardless of location. We design and implement custom private, public and hybrid cloud network solutions for our customers, offering bandwidth speeds from 10 Mbps to 100 Gbps per port with burstable and aggregate bandwidth capabilities. All services are available on a protected basis with the ability to specify pre-configured alternate routes to minimize the impact of any network disruption. \n \u2022 Internet Services. We offer domestic and multinational customers scalable, high-bandwidth global Internet connectivity and IP transit with guaranteed availability and packet delivery. Our Internet services offer flexible connectivity with multiple port interfaces including Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, 10 Gigabit Ethernet and 100 Gigabit Ethernet. We also offer broadband and wireless access services. We support a dual stack of IPv4 and IPv6 protocols, enabling the delivery of seamless IPv6 services alongside existing IPv4 services. \n \u2022 Managed Services. We offer fully managed network services, including managed equipment, managed security services and managed remote access, enabling customers to focus on their core business. These end-to-end services cover the design, procurement, implementation, monitoring and maintenance of a customer's network. \n \u2022 Voice and Unified Communication Services. Our SIP Trunking service is an enterprise-built unified communications offering that integrates voice, video and chat onto a single IP connection, driving efficiency and productivity organization-wide. Our Enterprise PBX service allows clients to eliminate traditional voice infrastructure with communication services delivered through the cloud. The offering includes fully hosted and hybrid models for maximum flexibility. \nOur customer contracts are generally for initial terms of three years, with some contracts at one year, and others at five years or more. Following the initial terms, these agreements typically provide for automatic renewal for specified periods ranging from one month to one year. Our prices are fixed for the duration of the contract, and we typically bill monthly in advance for such services. If a customer terminates its agreement, the terms of the Company's customer contracts typically require full recovery of any amounts due for the remainder of the term or, at a minimum, our liability to any underlying suppliers.\nOur revenue is composed of three primary categories that include monthly recurring revenue (or \"MRR\"), non-recurring revenue and usage revenue. MRR relates to contracted ongoing service that is generally fixed in price and paid by the customer on a monthly basis for the contracted term. For the year ended December 31, 2016, MRR was approximately 91% of our revenue. Non-recurring revenue primarily includes the amortization of previously collected installation and equipment charges to customers, and one-time termination charges for customers who cancel their services prior to the contract termination date. Usage revenue represents variable revenue based on whether a customer exceeds its committed usage threshold as specified in the contract.\nOur network supplier contracts do not have any market related net settlement provisions. We have not entered into, and do not plan to enter into, any supplier contracts that involve financial or derivative instruments. The supplier contracts are entered into solely for the direct purchase of telecommunications capacity, which is resold by us in the normal course of business.\nOther than cost of telecommunications services provided, our most significant operating expenses are employment costs. As of December 31, 2016, we had 662 full-time equivalent employees. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the employee cash compensation and benefits represented approximately 16% of revenue.\nFactors Affecting Our Results of Operations\nBusiness Acquisitions\nSince our formation, we have consummated a number of transactions accounted for as business combinations which were executed as part of our strategy of expanding through acquisitions. These acquisitions, which are in addition to our periodic purchases of customer contracts, have allowed us to increase the scale at which we operate which in turn affords us the ability to increase our operating leverage, extend our network, and broaden our customer base.The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the operations of the acquired entities from their respective acquisition dates. The acquisitions noted below are collectively defined as \"Acquisitions\" for purposes of explaining our results of operations.\nTelnes\nIn February 2016, we completed the acquisition of Telnes Broadband (\"Telnes\"). We paid $15.5 million in cash and issued 178,202 unregistered shares of our common stock valued at $2.0 million.\nOne Source\nIn October 2015, we completed the acquisition of One Source Networks Inc. (\"One Source\"). We paid $169.3 million in cash and issued 185,946 unregistered shares of our common stock valued at $2.3 million. We also issued 289,055 unregistered shares of our common stock to certain One Source employees as compensation for continuous employment valued at $3.6 million.\nMegaPath\nIn April 2015, we acquired MegaPath Corporation (\"MegaPath\"). We paid $141.4 million in cash (exclusive of the assumption of $3.4 million in capital leases), and issued 610,843 unregistered shares of our common stock valued at $7.5 million.\nUNSi\nIn October 2014, we acquired United Networks Services, Inc. (\"UNSi\"). We paid $32.5 million in cash and issued 231,539 of unregistered shares of our common stock valued at $2.9 million.\nAsset Purchases\nPeriodically we acquire customer contracts that we account for as an asset purchase and record a corresponding intangible asset that is amortized over its assumed useful life. During 2016 we acquired two portfolios of customer contracts for an aggregate purchase price of $41.3 million, of which $20 million was paid in 2016 at the respective closing dates. The remaining $21.3 million will be paid in 2017. We did not have any material asset purchases in 2015 or 2014, respectively.\nIndebtedness\nThe following summarizes our long-term debt at December 31, 2016 and 2015 (amounts in thousands):\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term loan\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>425,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>400,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>7.875% Senior Note\n</td> <td>300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving line of credit facility\n</td> <td>20,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt obligations\n</td> <td>745,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>405,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unamortized debt issuance costs\n</td> <td>(9,310\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,938\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unamortized original issuance discount\n</td> <td>(6,957\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,819\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Carrying value of debt\n</td> <td>729,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>386,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less current portion\n</td> <td>(4,300\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>725,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>382,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOctober 2015 Credit Agreement\nIn October 2015, we entered into a credit agreement (the October 2015 Credit Agreement\u201d) that provided for a $400.0 million term loan facility and a $50.0 million revolving line of credit facility (which includes a $15.0 million letter of credit facility and a $10.0 million swingline facility). The term loan facility was issued at a discount of $8.0 million. The maturity date of the term loan facility is October 22, 2022, and the maturity date of the revolving line of credit is October 22, 2020.\nOn May 3, 2016, we entered into an incremental term loan agreement that increased outstanding term loans by $30.0 million, the proceeds of which were used to repay the then outstanding revolving loans.\nOn June 28, 2016, we entered into Amendment No. 1 (the \"Repricing Amendment\") to the October 2015 Credit Agreement. The Repricing Amendment, among other things, reduced the applicable rate for term loans to LIBOR plus 4.75% (subject to a LIBOR floor of 1.00%) and reduced the applicable rate for revolving loans to LIBOR plus 4.25% (with no LIBOR floor).\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had drawn $20.0 million under the revolving line of credit and had $29.5 million of available borrowing capacity. Approximately $0.5 million of the revolving line of credit was utilized for outstanding letters of credit relating to our real estate lease obligations.\nOur obligations under the October 2015 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets. We were in compliance with all financial covenants under the October 2015 Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2016.\nThe effective interest rate on outstanding debt at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was 5.76% and 6.24% respectively.\n7.875% Senior Unsecured Notes\nOn December 22, 2016, in connection with the pending acquisitions of Hibernia Networks, we completed a private offering of $300 million aggregate principal amount of 7.875% senior unsecured notes due in 2024 (the \"Notes\"). The proceeds of the private offering were deposited into escrow, where the funds remained until all the escrow release conditions were satisfied, most notably the closing of the acquisition of Hibernia Networks on January 9, 2017. Had the acquisition agreement been terminated, the funds in escrow would have been released and returned to the investors of the Notes, including accrued and unpaid interest up to the date of release. We have recognized the proceeds from the private offering as restricted cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated financial statements. In connection with the offering, we incurred debt issuance costs of $9.7 million of which $0.5 million was incurred in 2016 and the remainder was incurred in 2017. The deferred costs associated with the Notes will begin amortizing in the first quarter of 2017.\nResults of Operations of the Company\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nOverview.

million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $521.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to the Acquisitions, as well as organic growth and the purchase of certain customer contracts.\nOn a constant currency basis using the average exchange rates in effect during the year ended December 31, 2015, revenue would have been higher by $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nCost of Telecommunications Services Provided\nCost of telecommunications services provided increased by $69.6 million, or 34.0%, from $204.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $274.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Consistent with our increase in revenue, the increase in cost of telecommunications services provided was principally driven by the Acquisitions, as well as organic growth and the purchase of certain customer contracts.\nOn a constant currency basis using the average exchange rates in effect during the year ended December 31, 2015, cost of telecommunications services provided would have been higher by $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOperating Expenses\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG&A expenses increased by $41.5 million, or 40.8%, from $101.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $143.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Cash compensation expense increased $23.4 million or 39.2% from $59.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $83.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the Acquisitions.\nNon-cash compensation expense increased by $7.9 million, or 100.3%, from $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 driven by (i) the recognition of share-based compensation for performance awards where the performance criteria have been met, (ii) certain shares issued to former employees of One Source which were accounted for as compensation, and (iii) an overall increase in quantity of employee equity awards. Transaction and integration costs decreased by $1.3 million, or 21.4% from $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Other SG&A expense increased $11.5 million, or 41.0%, from $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $39.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of the Acquisitions.\nSeverance, Restructuring and Other Exit Costs. Restructuring costs decreased by $11.8 million, or 93.1%, from $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $0.9 million for year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was due to the fact that we closed two large acquisitions in 2015 (One Source and MegaPath), compared to one small acquisition in 2016 (Telnes).\nDepreciation and Amortization. Amortization of intangible assets increased $14.7 million, or 56.5%, from $26.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $40.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to an increase in definite-lived intangible assets from the Acquisitions and the purchase of certain customer contracts. Depreciation expense increased by $1.4 million, or 6.8%, from $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the addition of property and equipment from the Acquisitions.\nOther Expense. Other expense increased by $13.1 million, or 70.7% from $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This is primarily attributed to higher interest expense related to increased debt levels to support acquisition activities.\nOn a constant currency basis using the average exchange rates in effect during the year ended December 31, 2015, operating expenses would have been higher by $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Selling, general and administrative expenses are the only operating expenses that would have been impacted by the change in exchange rates.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nRevenue\nOur revenue increased by $161.9 million, or 78.1%, from $207.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $369.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the Acquisitions completed in 2015.\nOn a constant currency basis using the average exchange rates in effect during the year ended December 31, 2014, revenue would have been higher by $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nCost of Telecommunications Services Provided\nCost of telecommunications services provided increased by $76.4 million, or 59.6%, from $128.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $204.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Consistent with our increase in revenue, the increase in cost of telecommunications services provided was principally driven by the Acquisitions.\nOn a constant currency basis using the average exchange rates in effect during the year ended December 31, 2014, cost of telecommunications services provided would have been higher by $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOperating Expenses\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG&A expenses increased by $56.1 million, or 123.0% from $45.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $101.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash compensation expense increased by $30.1 million, or 102.0%, from $29.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $59.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, due primarily to the Acquisitions. Non-cash compensation expense increased by $5.5 million, or 225.7%, from $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, driven by the recognition of share-based compensation for performance awards where the performance criteria have been met and an overall increase in the quantity of employee equity awards. Other SG&A expense increased $14.4 million, or 105.7%, from $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Transaction and integration was $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. There were no transition and integration costs incurred in 2014.\nSeverance, Restructuring and Other Exit Costs. Restructuring costs increased by $3.2 million, or 34.4% from $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $12.7 million for year ended December 31, 2015. The $12.7 million in 2015 is comprised of exit costs associated with the acquisition of One Source and MegaPath, and the $9.4 million in 2014 is comprised of $6.1 million of exit costs associated with the acquisition of UNSi and $3.3 million in litigation settlement.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Amortization of intangible assets increased $12.2 million, or 88.4%, from $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $26.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, due to the addition of definite-lived intangible assets from the Acquisitions. Similarly, depreciation expense increased $9.6 million, or 86.5%, from $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the addition of property and equipment from the Acquisitions.\nOther Expense. Other expense decreased by $1.7 million, or 8.2%, from $20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded $6.9 million of expense associated with the change in fair value of the warrant liability that was extinguished in the third quarter of 2014. This was offset by increased interest expense of $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, attributed to increased debt for the acquisitions during 2015.\nUsing constant currency, when compared to 2014, operating expense for year ended December 31, 2015, would have been $1.6 million higher than reported. Selling, general and administrative expenses are the only operating expenses that would have been impacted by the change in exchange rates.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d), from time to time we may use or publicly disclose certain \"non-GAAP financial measures\" in the course of our financial presentations, earnings releases, earnings conference calls, and otherwise. For these purposes, the SEC defines a \"non-GAAP financial measure\" as a numerical measure of historical or future financial performance, financial positions, or cash flows that (i) exclude amounts, or is subject to adjustments that effectively exclude amounts, included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in financial statements, and (ii) include amounts, or is subject to adjustments that effectively include amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional information to investors to provide an alternative method for assessing our financial condition and operating results. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when taken together with our GAAP financial measures, allow us and our investors to better evaluate our performance and profitability. These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP, and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial\nmeasures used by other companies. These measures should be used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP, and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures.\nPursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also generally present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure we reference with such comparable GAAP financial measure.\nAdjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ( Adjusted EBITDA\u201d)\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income/(loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") adjusted to exclude severance, restructuring and other exit costs, acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, losses on extinguishment of debt, share-based compensation, and from time to time, other non-cash or non-recurring items.\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate operating performance, and this financial measure is among the primary measures we use for planning and forecasting future periods. We further believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view results in a manner similar to the method used by management and makes it easier to compare our results with the results of other companies that have different financing and capital structures. In addition, we have debt covenants that are based on a leverage ratio that utilizes a modified EBITDA calculation, as defined in our credit agreement. The modified EBITDA calculation is similar to our definition of Adjusted EBITDA; however it includes the pro forma Adjusted EBITDA of and expected cost synergies from the companies acquired by us during the applicable reporting period. Finally, Adjusted EBITDA results, along with other quantitative and qualitative information, are utilized by management and our compensation committee for purposes of determining bonus payouts to our employees.\nAdjusted EBITDA Less Capital Expenditures\nAdjusted EBITDA less purchases of property and equipment, which we also refer to as capital expenditures or capex, is a performance measure that we use to evaluate the appropriate level of capital expenditures needed to support our expected revenue, and to provide a comparable view of our performance relative to other telecommunications companies who may utilize different strategies for providing access to fiber-based services and related infrastructure. We use a \"capex light\" strategy, which means we purchase fiber-based services and related infrastructure from other providers on an as-needed basis, pursuant to our customers' requirements. Many other telecommunications companies spend significant amounts of capital expenditures to construct their own fiber networks and data centers, and attempt to purchase as little as possible from other providers. As a result of our strategy, we typically have lower Adjusted EBITDA margins compared to other providers, but also spend much less on capital expenditures relative to our revenue. We believe it is important to take both of these factors into account when evaluating our performance.\nThe following is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures from Net Income (Loss):\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Unaudited)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(22,979\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for (benefit from) income taxes\n</td> <td>3,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34,131\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other expense, net\n</td> <td>30,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on debt extinguishment\n</td> <td>1,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>62,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Severance, restructuring and other exit costs\n</td> <td>870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction and integration costs\n</td> <td>4,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share-based compensation\n</td> <td>15,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>125,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchases of property and equipment\n</td> <td>(24,189\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,070\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,819\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations, equity offerings and debt financing. Our principal uses of cash have been for acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures, and debt service requirements. We anticipate that our principal uses of cash in the future will be for acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital, and debt service.\nManagement monitors cash flow and liquidity requirements on a regular basis, including an analysis of the anticipated working capital requirements for the next 12 months. This analysis assumes our ability to manage expenses, capital expenditures, indebtedness and the anticipated growth of revenue. If our operating performance differs significantly from our forecasts, we may be required to reduce our operating expenses and curtail capital spending, and we may not remain in compliance with our debt covenants. In addition, if we are unable to fully fund our cash requirements through operations and current cash on hand, we may need to obtain additional financing through a combination of equity and debt financings and/or renegotiation of terms of our existing debt. If any such activities become necessary, there can be no assurance that we would be successful in obtaining additional financing or modifying our existing debt terms.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $29.7 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, and our current assets were $23.0 million greater than current liabilities. Our current liabilities include $24.4 million of earn-outs and holdback obligations payable in 2017; and $3.2 million of accrued severance and exit costs with a substantial portion of this obligation expected to be paid in 2017. We believe that cash currently on hand, expected cash flows from future operations and existing borrowing capacity are sufficient to fund operations for at least the next 12 months.\nOur capital expenditures increased by $10.1 million, or 71.9%, from $14.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $24.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in capital expenditures was due to our growth, but remained less than 5% of revenue, consistent with our 'capex light' strategy. We anticipate that we will incur capital expenditures in the range of 6% to 7% of revenue in 2017, taking into consideration the recent acquisition of Hibernia Networks, which closed in January 2017. We continue to expect that our capital expenditures will be primarily success-based, i.e., in support of specific revenue opportunities.\nCashflows\nWe believe that our cash flows from operating activities, in addition to cash on-hand, will be sufficient to fund our operating activities and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future, and in any event for at least the next 12 to 18 months. However, no assurance can be given that this will be the case.\nThe following table summarizes the components of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Data\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,475\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(362,601\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(314,772\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(43,513\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>318,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>253,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Provided (or Used) by Operating Activities\nOur largest source of cash provided by operating activities is monthly recurring revenue from our customers. Our primary uses of cash are payments to network suppliers, compensation related costs and third-party vendors such as agents, contractors, and professional service providers.\nNet cash flows from operating activities increased by $35.9 million, or 145.6%, from $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $60.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, due primarily to the Acquisitions, as well as organic growth and the purchase of certain customer contracts. Net cash flows from operating activities increased by $31.1 million, or 480.7%, from a use of operating cash of $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to a source of operating cash of $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, also due primarily to the Acquisitions, as well as organic growth and the purchase of certain customer contracts.\nCash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 included $4.4 million cash paid for severance and exit costs, $4.8 million cash paid for transaction and integration costs and a working capital use of $29.5 million. The working capital use was driven by an effort to improve the timeliness of payments to our key vendors, and slower payment timing by some of our larger customers. We have several initiatives underway to improve payment timing from our customers, which we expect to take effect in 2017.\nCash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 includes $8.0 million cash paid for severance and exit costs, $6.1 million cash paid for transaction and integration costs, and a working capital use of $24.2 million.\nCash used by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2014 includes $4.8 million cash paid for severance and exit costs, and a working capital use of $23.8 million.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nOur primary uses of cash include acquisitions, purchase of customer contracts and capital expenditures.\nNet cash flows from investing activities increased by $47.8 million, or 15.2% from $314.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $362.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net cash flows from investing activities increased by $271.3 million, or 623.4%, from $43.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $314.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nCash used for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily consisted of $304.3 million for restricted cash that was deposited into escrow in anticipation of the Hibernia Networks acquisition that closed on January 9, 2017 (see Note 15 - Subsequent Events for details). We also completed the Telnes acquisition and certain customer contract purchases during 2016 for which we paid a total of approximately $34.1 million, in addition to capital expenditures of approximately $24.2 million.\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily consisted of $300.7 million of cash used for the acquisitions of One Source and MegaPath, in addition to capital expenditures of approximately $14.1 million.\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily consisted of $37.5 million of cash used for the acquisition of UNSi and capital expenditures of $5.8 million.\nCash Provided by Financing Activities\nOur primary source of cash for financing activities is debt financing proceeds. Our primary use of cash for financing activities is the refinancing of our debt and repayment of principal pursuant to the debt agreements.\nNet cash flows from financing activities increased by $65.1 million, or 25.7% from $253.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $318.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net cash flows from financing activities increased by $165.3 million, or 187.3%, from $88.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $253.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016, was $318.6 million consisting primarily of $300.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of senior notes to fund the Hibernia Networks acquisition that closed on January 9, 2017 (see Note 15 - Subsequent Events for details).\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015, was $253.5 million, which primarily consisted of net proceeds from the October 2015 Credit Agreement used to fund the acquisition of One Source.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014, was $88.2 million, which primarily consisted of $72.7 million from new equity raised and net debt proceeds of $29.4 million from the August 2014 Credit Agreement. For additional discussion of indebtedness, refer to Note 6 - Debt of the consolidated financial statements.\nOther cash flows\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we made cash payments for interest totaling $26.3 million, $13.1 million and $8.0 million, respectively. The increase in interest payments is a result of the incremental debt associated with the Acquisitions, as discussed further in Note 6 - Debt of the consolidated financial statements.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had contractual payment obligations of approximately $955.2 million.\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 (amounts in thousands):\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term loan\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>425,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>404,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>7.875% Senior Note\n</td> <td>300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving line of credit\n</td> <td>20,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>10,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>473\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital leases\n</td> <td>1,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Network supplier agreements (1)\n</td> <td>189,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (2)\n</td> <td>8,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>955,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>706,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Excludes contracts where the initial term has expired and we are currently in month-to-month status.\n(2) \"Other\" consists of vendor contracts associated with network monitoring and maintenance services.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nSubsequent Events\nHibernia Acquisition\nOn January 9, 2017, we acquired 100% of Hibernia Networks. We paid $621.5 million, comprised of $515.0 million in cash consideration, $14.6 million net cash acquired and 3,329,872 unregistered shares of our common stock, initially valued at $75.0 million on the date of announcement, and ultimately valued at $91.9 million at closing. The purchase price is subject to a final post-closing reconciliation for closing date cash, net working capital, transaction expenses, indebtedness, certain tax payments and prepaid customer contracts.\n$300.0 million of the cash consideration was funded by proceeds from the issuance of the 7.875% senior unsecured notes (\"Notes\"), which was funded into escrow in December 2016 (refer to Note 6 - Debt of the consolidated financial statements for further information). The remainder was funded by a new credit agreement, which is discussed in more detail below.\nThe Company expects the integration of Hibernia to be substantially complete by the end of the third quarter of 2017.\nCredit Agreement\nIn conjunction with the Hibernia acquisition, we closed on a new credit agreement (the \"2017 Credit Agreement\") on January 9, 2017. The 2017 Credit Agreement provides a $700.0 million term loan facility and a $75.0 million revolving line of credit facility. At our election, the loans under the 2017 Credit Agreement may be made as either Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Loans, with applicable margins at 3.00% and 4.00%, respectively. The Eurodollar Loans will be subject to a floor of 1.00%, and the applicable margin for revolving loans will be 2.50% for Base Rate Loans and 3.50% for Eurodollar Loans.\nThe maturity date of the term loan facility is January 9, 2024 and the maturity date of the revolving loan facility is January 9, 2022. The principal amount of the term loan facility is payable in equal quarterly installments of $1.75 million, commencing on March 31, 2017 and continuing thereafter until the maturity date, when the remaining balance of outstanding principal is payable in full. The revolving loan facility contains a maximum consolidated net secured leverage ratio when more than 30% is utilized.\nThe proceeds from the Notes and 2017 Credit Agreement were used to fund the Hibernia acquisition, repay existing indebtedness, pay various fees and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition and related financing transactions, and for general corporate purposes.\nFor additional details on our indebtedness, refer to Note 6 - Debt of the consolidated financial statements or the Liquidity and Capital Resources section included herein.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and the impact of such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements. Our critical accounting policies have been discussed with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, and believe that an understanding of these policies is important to a proper evaluation of the reported consolidated financial results. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on reported results of operations.\nSegment Reporting\nWe report operating results and financial data in one operating and reporting segment. The chief operating decision maker manages our business as a single profit center in order to promote collaboration, provide comprehensive service offerings across our entire customer base, and provide incentives to employees based on the success of the organization as a whole. Although certain information regarding selected products or services is discussed for purposes of promoting an understanding of our complex business, the chief operating decision maker manages our business and allocates resources at the consolidated level.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe deliver four primary services to our customers - flexible Ethernet-based wide area network services; high bandwidth Internet connectivity services; managed network services and security services; and global communication and collaboration services. Certain of our current commercial activities have features that may be considered multiple elements, specifically, when we sell Customer Premise Equipment (\"CPE\") in addition to our services. We believe that there is sufficient evidence to determine each element's fair\nvalue and, as a result, in those arrangements where there are multiple elements, the service revenue is recorded ratably over the term of the agreement and the equipment is accounted for as a sale, at the time of sale, as long as collectability is reasonably assured.\nOur services are provided under contracts that typically provide for an installation charge along with payments of recurring charges on a monthly basis for use of the services over a committed term. Our contracts with customers specify the terms and conditions for providing such services, including installation date, recurring and non-recurring fees, payment terms and length of term. These contracts call for us to provide the service in question (e.g., data transmission between point A and point Z), to manage the activation process, and to provide ongoing support (in the form of service maintenance and trouble-shooting) during the service term. The contracts do not typically provide the customer any rights to use specifically identifiable assets. Furthermore, the contracts generally provide us with discretion to engineer (or re-engineer) a particular network solution to satisfy each customer's data transmission requirement, and typically prohibit physical access by the customer to the network infrastructure used by us and our suppliers to deliver the services.\nWe recognize revenue as follows:\nMonthly Recurring Revenue. Monthly recurring revenue represents the substantial majority of our revenue, and consists of fees we charge for ongoing services that are generally fixed in price and billed on a recurring monthly basis (one month in advance) for a specified term. At the end of the term, most contracts provide for a continuation of services on the same terms, either for a specified renewal period (e.g., one year) or on a month-to-month basis. We record recurring revenue based on the fees agreed to in each contract, as long as the contract is in effect.\nUsage Revenue. Usage revenue represents variable charges for certain services, based on specific usage of those services, or usage above a fixed threshold, billed monthly in arrears. We record usage revenue based on actual usage charges billed using the rates and/or thresholds specified in each contract.\nNon-recurring Revenue. Non-recurring revenue consists of charges for installation in connection with the delivery of recurring communications services, late payments, cancellation fees, early termination fees and equipment sales. Fees billed for installation services are initially recorded as deferred revenue then recognized ratably over the contractual term of the recurring service. We believe that the contract term serves as the best estimate of the expected relationship term. Fees charged for late payments, cancellation (pre-installation) or early termination (post-installation) are typically fixed or determinable per the terms of the respective contract, and are recognized as revenue when billed. In addition, from time to time we sell communications and/or networking equipment to our customers in connection with our data networking services. We recognize revenue from the sale of equipment at the contracted selling price when title to the equipment passes to the customer (generally F.O.B. origin).\nWe record revenue only when collectability is reasonably assured, irrespective of the type of revenue.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe issue three types of grants under our share-based compensation plan, time-based restricted stock, time-based stock options, and performance-based restricted stock. The time-based restricted stock and stock options generally vest over a four-year period, contingent upon meeting the requisite service period requirement. Performance awards typically vest over a shorter period, e.g., two years, starting when the performance criteria established in the grant have been met.\nThe share price on the day of grant is used as the fair value for all restricted stock. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the estimated fair value for stock options. Critical inputs into the Black-Scholes option-pricing model include the following: option exercise price; fair value of the stock price; expected life of the option; annualized volatility of the stock; annual rate of quarterly dividends on the stock; and risk-free interest rate.\nImplied volatility is calculated as of each grant date based on our historical stock price volatility along with an assessment of a peer group. Other than the expected life of the option, volatility is the most sensitive input to our option grants. The risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model is determined by referencing the U.S. Treasury yield curve rates with the remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. Forfeitures are estimated based on our historical analysis of attrition levels. Forfeiture estimates are updated quarterly for actual forfeitures.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method pursuant to GAAP. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement\ncarrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period of the change. Further, deferred tax assets are recognized for the expected realization of available net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is recorded on gross deferred tax assets when it is \"more likely than not\" that such asset will not be realized. When evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets, all evidence, both positive and negative, is evaluated. Items considered in this analysis include the ability to carry back losses, the reversal of temporary differences, tax planning strategies and expectations of future earnings. We review our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine if a valuation allowance is required based upon these factors. Changes in our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance could give rise to a change in such allowance, potentially resulting in additional expense or benefit in the period of change.\nOur income tax provision includes U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes and is based on pre-tax income or loss. In determining the annual effective income tax rate, we analyzed various factors, including our annual earnings and taxing jurisdictions in which the earnings were generated, the impact of state and local income taxes and our ability to use tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards.\nUnder GAAP for income taxes, the amount of tax benefit to be recognized is the amount of benefit that is \"more likely than not\" to be sustained upon examination. We analyze our tax filing positions in all of the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns, as well as for all open tax years in these jurisdictions. If, based on this analysis, we determine that uncertainties in tax positions exist, a liability is established in the consolidated financial statements. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax positions in the provision for income taxes.\nEstimating Allowances and Accrued Liabilities\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe establish an allowance for bad debts for accounts receivable amounts that may not be collectible. We state our accounts receivable balances at amounts due from the customer net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. We determine this allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time receivables are past due, previous loss history and the customer's current ability to pay. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had an allowance for doubtful accounts of $2.7 million and $1.0 million, respectively.\nAllowance for Vendor Disputes\nIn the normal course of business, we identify errors by suppliers with respect to the billing of services. We perform bill verification procedures to ensure that errors in our suppliers' billed invoices are identified and resolved. If we conclude that a vendor has billed us inaccurately, we will record a liability only for the amount that we believe is owed. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $5.8 million and $6.9 million, respectively, in disputed billings from suppliers that were not accrued because we do not believe we owe them.\nDeferred Costs\nInstallation costs related to provisioning of recurring communications services that we incur from third-party suppliers, directly attributable and necessary to fulfill a particular service contract, and which costs would not have been incurred but for the occurrence of that service contract, are recorded as deferred contract costs and expensed ratably over the contractual term of service in the same manner as the deferred revenue arising from that contract. Based on historical experience, we believe the initial contractual term is the best estimate for the period of earnings. If any installation costs exceed the amount of corresponding deferred revenue, the excess cost is recognized in the current period.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe record the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination as goodwill. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually, in October, or more frequently if a triggering event occurs between impairment testing dates. We operate as a single operating segment and as a single reporting unit for the purpose of evaluating goodwill impairment. Our impairment assessment begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more like than not that fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. The qualitative assessment includes comparing our overall financial performance against the planned results used in the last quantitative goodwill impairment test. Additionally, we assess the fair value in light of certain events and circumstances, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and other relevant entity and Company specific events. The selection and assessment of qualitative factors used to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting units exceeds the carrying value involves significant judgments and estimates.\nIf it is determined under the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then a two-step quantitative impairment test is performed. Under the first step, we estimate the fair value compared with our carrying value (including goodwill). If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, step two does not need to be performed. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, an indication of goodwill impairments exists and we would need to perform step two of the impairment test. Under step two, an impairment loss would be recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of our goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The fair value under the two-step assessment is determined using a combination of both income and market-based approaches. There were no impairments identified for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nIntangible assets arising from business combinations, such as acquired customer contracts and relationships, (collectively \"customer relationships\"), trade names, intellectual property or know-how, are initially recorded at fair value. We amortize these intangible assets over the determined useful life which ranges from three to seven years. We review the intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. If the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between fair value and the carrying value of the asset. There were no impairments recognized for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.\nFurther information is available in Note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein.\nBusiness Combinations and Asset Acquisitions\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.\nWe recognize the purchase of assets and the assumption of liabilities as an asset acquisition, if the transaction does not constitute a business combination. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price is allocated on a relative fair value basis to the identifiable assets and liabilities. No goodwill is recorded in an asset acquisition.\nCritical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships and developed technology, discount rates and terminal values. Our estimate of fair value is based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but actual results may differ from estimates.\nOther estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as more fully discussed in Note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRevenue Recognition\nOn May 28, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which delays the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. The FASB also agreed to allow entities to choose to adopt the standard as of the original effective date. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. The guidance includes indicators to assist an entity in determining whether it controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to the customers. The new revenue recognition standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2018, with the option to adopt it in the first quarter of 2017. We currently anticipate adopting the new standard effective January 1, 2018. The new standard also permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the modified retrospective method). While we are still in the process of completing our analysis on the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, we are not aware of any material impact the new standard will have and we anticipate adopting the standard using the modified retrospective method. This assessment excludes the potential impact the acquisition of Hibernia Networks will have on our analysis. Refer to Note 15 - Subsequent Events to the consolidated financial statements for further details on the acquisition.\nLease Accounting\nOn February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which requires most leases (with the exception of leases with terms of less than one year) to be recognized on the balance sheet as an asset and a lease liability. Leases will be classified as an operating lease or a financing lease. Operating leases are expensed using the straight-line method, whereas financing leases will be treated similarly to a capital lease under the current standard. The new standard will be effective for annual and interim periods, within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, but early adoption is permitted. The new standard must be presented using the modified retrospective method beginning with the earliest comparative period presented. We are currently evaluating the effect of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nShare-Based Payment\nOn March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which was issued as part of the FASB's simplification initiative and cover such areas as (i) the recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies and the classification of those excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows, (ii) an accounting policy election for forfeitures to be estimated or account for when incurred, (iii) the amount an employer can withhold to cover income taxes and still qualify for equity classification, and (iv) the classification of those taxes paid on the statement of cash flows. This update is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, which will require us to adopt these provisions in the first quarter of 2017. This guidance will be applied either prospectively, retrospectively or using a modified retrospective transition method, depending on the specific area covered. We do not expect the new guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nClassification of Certain Cash Transactions\nOn August 26, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which is intended to reduce diversity in practice of how certain transactions are classified and presented in the statement of cash flows in accordance with ASC 230. The ASU amends or clarifies guidance on eight specific cash flow issues, some of which include classification on debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. The standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those periods. Early adoption is permitted, provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period. The guidance requires application using a retrospective transition method. We are currently evaluating the effect of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures but we do not expect the new guidance"}
