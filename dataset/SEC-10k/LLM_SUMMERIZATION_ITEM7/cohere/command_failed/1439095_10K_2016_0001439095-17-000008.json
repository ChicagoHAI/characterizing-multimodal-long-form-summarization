We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise, except to the extent law requires.\nOverview\nWe are the largest global industrial distributor, based on sales, of pipe, valves, and fittings ( PVF\u201d) and related products and services to the energy industry and hold a leading position in our industry across each of the upstream (exploration, production and extraction of underground oil and natural gas), midstream (gathering and transmission of oil and natural gas, natural gas utilities and the storage and distribution of oil and natural gas) and downstream (crude oil refining, petrochemical and chemical, processing and general industrials) sectors. Our business is segregated into three geographic reportable segments, consisting of our U.S., Canada and International operations. We serve our customers from approximately 300 service locations. We offer a wide array of PVF and oilfield supplies encompassing a complete line of products from our global network of over 12,000 suppliers to our more than 17,000 customers. We are diversified by geography, the industry sectors we serve and the products we sell. We seek to provide best-in-class service to our customers by satisfying the most complex, multi-site needs of many of the largest companies in the energy sector as their primary PVF supplier. We believe the critical role we play in our customers' supply chain, together with our extensive product offering, broad global presence, customer-linked scalable information systems and efficient distribution capabilities, serve to solidify our long-standing customer relationships and drive our growth. As a result, we have an average relationship of over 25 years with our 25 largest customers.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nKey Drivers of Our Business\nOur revenue are predominantly derived from the sale of PVF and other oilfield and industrial supplies to the energy sector globally. Our business is, therefore, dependent upon both the current conditions and future prospects in the energy industry and, in particular, maintenance and expansionary operating and capital expenditures by our customers in the upstream, midstream and downstream sectors of the industry. We have seen customer spending fall off significantly beginning in late 2014 and continuing through 2016 as a result of lower oil and natural gas prices. Long-term growth in spending has been driven by several factors, including underinvestment in global energy infrastructure, growth in shale and unconventional exploration and production ( E&P\u201d) activity, and anticipated strength in the oil, natural gas, refined products and petrochemical sectors. The outlook for future oil, natural gas, refined products and petrochemical PVF spending is influenced by numerous factors, including the following:\n\ufeff\n\u2022Oil and Natural Gas Prices. Sales of PVF and related products to the oil and natural gas industry constitute over 90% of our sales. As a result, we depend upon the oil and natural gas industry and its ability and willingness to make maintenance and capital expenditures to explore for, produce and process oil, natural gas and refined products. Oil and natural gas prices, both current and projected, along with the costs necessary to produce oil and gas, impact other drivers of our business, including capital spending by customers, additions and maintenance to pipeline mileage, refinery utilization and petrochemical processing activity.\n\u2022Economic Conditions. The demand for the products we distribute is dependent on the general economy, the energy sector and other factors. Changes in the general economy or in the energy sector (domestically or internationally) can cause demand for the products we distribute to materially change.\n\u2022Manufacturer and Distributor Inventory Levels of PVF and Related Products. Manufacturer and distributor inventory levels of PVF and related products can change significantly from period to period. Increased inventory levels by manufacturers or other distributors can cause an oversupply of PVF and related products in the industry sectors we serve and reduce the prices that we are able to charge for the products we distribute. Reduced prices, in turn, would likely reduce our profitability. Conversely, decreased manufacturer inventory levels may ultimately lead to increased demand for our products and would likely result in increased sales volumes and overall profitability.\n\u2022 Steel Prices, Availability and Supply and Demand. Fluctuations in steel prices can lead to volatility in the pricing of the products we distribute, especially carbon steel tubular products, which can influence the buying patterns of our customers. A majority of the products we distribute contain various types of steel. The worldwide supply and demand for these products, or other steel products that we do not supply, impacts the pricing and availability of our products and, ultimately, our sales and operating profitability.\nRecent Trends and Outlook\nDuring 2016, the average oil price of West Texas Intermediate ( WTI\u201d) decreased to $43.29 per barrel compared to $48.66 per barrel in 2015. Natural gas prices decreased to an average price of $2.52/Mcf (Henry Hub) for 2016 compared to $2.62/Mcf (Henry Hub) for 2015. North American drilling rig activity decreased 45% in 2016 compared to 2015.\n\ufeff\nIn recent years, there has been an increase in the global supply of crude oil, including the contribution of U.S. shale oil, at a pace exceeding demand growth. This increase combined with a hesitance on the part of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC\u201d) to curb production triggered a dramatic decline in oil prices that began in late 2014, continued throughout 2015, and persists today, but supply and demand is expected to tighten with production cuts announced by OPEC in November 2016. This low price environment has, in turn, resulted in a dramatic decline in exploration and production ( E&P\u201d) capital spending by our customers, which directly impacts our business. In 2016, customer spending fell by 27%, following a 21% decline in 2015, which brought spending to its lowest levels since 2009. This marks the first time in nearly 30 years that global spending has been down in consecutive years. However, we are encouraged by recent improvements in oil prices and drilling activity and expect 2017 revenue to be higher than 2016. Prominent exploration and production ( E&P\u201d) spending surveys, which include many of our customers, indicate that 2017 spending will increase with more significant growth in 2018 and 2019. We expect our business to follow the same trend.\n\ufeff\nIn January 2017, a new U.S. President took office and new U.S. Congress was seated. They have publicly made statements regarding the desire to support United States energy producers, refocus the EPA on its core mission, focus on United States interests first and lessen the regulatory burden on businesses to create job growth. They have also announced an aggressive policy agenda to change the tax system, modify the relationships between the United States and other countries, cancel or modify trade treaties and remake relationships with other countries. Until specific laws are passed, executive actions are taken or federal regulatory action is enacted, it is unclear what impact these policies will have on our business. While at first impression these policies could decrease the regulatory and tax burden on our business and the businesses of our U.S. customers, increase oil and gas production in the U.S. and, as a result, our U.S. business activity and increase the sales of product from our U.S. suppliers, it is not clear that all impacts would be positive. However, in the absence of specifics and given the government's generally supportive stance for the oil and gas industry, and based on\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nE&P spending surveys and our customers' current outlook for oil and gas supply and demand, we expect our business to increase in 2017 with continued growth through 2018 and 2019.\n\ufeff\nWe have taken steps in 2016 to reduce our operating costs. We have maintained our hiring and salary freezes, which were implemented in 2015, and eliminated an additional 600 full-time positions and closed 30 branches in 2016. As a result of these actions, we recorded pre-tax severance and restructuring charges of $20 million in 2016. We have reduced our headcount by approximately 1,500 or 30%, and our number of branch locations by 74, or 31%, since June 2014. In addition to these efforts to address costs, we continuously manage our investment in working capital to an appropriate level based on current and forecasted sales volumes.\n\ufeff\nIn the third quarter of 2016, we incurred non-cash inventory-related charges totaling $45 million necessary to reduce the carrying value of certain products determined to be excess or obsolete to their estimated net realizable value based on our current market outlook for those products. This amount included $24 million in the International segment primarily related to a restructuring of our Australian business and market conditions in Iraq. Reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were increased in the U.S. and Canada by $16 million and $5 million, respectively.\n\ufeff\nIn August 2016, we announced a plan to restructure and downsize our Australian operations in response to the continued downturn in the oil and gas and mining industries in the region. As a result of this plan, we incurred $17 million of charges, including $10 million of inventory-related charges, $4 million of lease termination and property costs, $2 million of employee severance and $1 million of other relocation costs. These charges included $7 million of cash costs. The restructuring plan was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 2016. Elsewhere in our International segment, the United Kingdom's decision to exit the European Union ( Brexit\u201d) has created uncertainty around European currencies, along with uncertain effects of future trade and other cross border activities of the U.K. with the European Union and other countries. We expect a minimal impact on our business, and our regional distribution centers in both Bradford, U.K. and Rotterdam, Netherlands position us well to serve our customers in the U.K. and the European Union.\nWe determine backlog by the amount of unshipped customer orders, either specific or general in nature, which the customer may revise or cancel in certain instances.

There can be no assurance that the backlog amounts will ultimately be realized as revenue or that we will earn a profit on the backlog of orders, but we expect that substantially all of the sales in

EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to an equivalent GAAP measure, see pages 32-34 herein.\nSales. Sales include the revenue recognized from the sales of the products we distribute, services we provide and freight billings to customers, less cash discounts taken by customers in return for their early payment. Our sales were $3,041 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $4,529 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $1,488 million decrease reflected a $24 million impact of the decline in foreign currencies in areas where we operate compared to the U.S. dollar.\nU.S. Segment-Our U.S. sales decreased $1,275 million to $2,297 million for 2016 from $3,572 for 2015. This 36% decrease reflected a $698 million decrease in the upstream sector, a $329 million decrease in the midstream sector and a $248 million decrease in the downstream sector. The decline in the upstream sector included a $287 million impact from the disposition of our U.S. OCTG product line. The remaining decrease in sales 2016 as compared 2015 was caused by decreased customer spending for both maintenance, repair and operations ( MRO\u201d) and projects, driven by the sustained low oil and natural gas prices and the resulting decline in rig count.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCanadian Segment-Our Canadian sales decreased $90 million to $243 million for 2016 from $333 million for 2015. This 27% decrease reflected a $79 million decrease in the upstream business also due to a decrease in customer spending. Approximately $10 million, or 11%, of the total decline was a result of the weaker Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.\nInternational Segment-Our International sales decreased $123 million to $501 million for 2016 from $624 million for 2015. This $123 million, or 20%, decrease reflected the combined impact of lower project activity and deferral of MRO expenditures particularly in Norway, Australia, the Netherlands, the U.K., and Singapore. The impact of the decline in the foreign currencies in areas where we operate outside of the U.S. dollar accounted for $14 million, or 11%, of the total decline.\nGross Profit. Our gross profit was $468 million (15.4% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $786 million (17.4% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $318 million decrease was primarily attributable to the reduction in sales volumes. In addition, gross profit for 2016 was negatively impacted by $45 million of inventory-related charges to reduce the carrying value of certain excess and obsolete inventory items to their realizable value. Gross profit for 2016 benefited modestly from lower product costs reflected in our last-in, first-out ( LIFO\u201d) inventory costing methodology. LIFO resulted in a reduction of cost of sales of $14 million and $53 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding the impact of LIFO and the inventory-related charges, gross profit percentage improved 20 basis points as a result of sales mix changes including the elimination of our lower margin OCTG product line.\nCertain purchasing costs and warehousing activities (including receiving, inspection, and stocking costs), as well as general warehousing expenses, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses and not in cost of sales. As such, our gross profit may not be comparable to others who may include these expenses as a component of costs of goods sold. Purchasing and warehousing activities costs approximated $30 million and $37 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nAdjusted Gross Profit. Adjusted Gross Profit decreased to $523 million (17.2% of sales) for 2016 from $814 million (18.0% of sales) for 2015, a decrease of $291 million. Adjusted Gross Profit for 2016 included the impact of the $45 million of inventory-related charges discussed above. Adjusted Gross Profit is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted Gross Profit as sales, less cost of sales, plus depreciation and amortization, plus amortization of intangibles, and plus or minus the impact of our LIFO inventory costing methodology. We present Adjusted Gross Profit because we believe it is a useful indicator of our operating performance without regard to items, such as amortization of intangibles, that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon the nature and extent of acquisitions. Similarly, the impact of the LIFO inventory costing method can cause results to vary substantially from company to company depending upon whether they elect to utilize LIFO and depending upon which method they may elect. We use Adjusted Gross Profit as a key performance indicator in managing our business. We believe that gross profit is the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles that is most directly comparable to Adjusted Gross Profit.\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted Gross Profit, a non-GAAP financial measure, with our gross profit, as derived from our consolidated financial statements (in millions):\n\ufeff\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPercentage\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPercentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nof Revenue\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nof Revenue\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross profit, as reported\n</td> <td>\n$ 468\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>15.4% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 786\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>17.4% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>22 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>0.7% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>21 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>0.5% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmortization of intangibles\n</td> <td>47 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1.6% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>60 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1.3% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDecrease in LIFO reserve\n</td> <td>(14) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(0.5%) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(53) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(1.2%) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdjusted Gross Profit\n</td> <td>\n$ 523\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>17.2% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 814\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>18.0% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expenses. Costs such as salaries, wages, employee benefits, rent, utilities, communications, insurance, fuel and taxes (other than state and federal income taxes) that are necessary to operate our branch and corporate operations are included in SG&A. Also contained in this category are certain items that are non-operational in nature, including certain costs of acquiring and integrating other businesses. Our SG&A expenses were $524 million (17.2% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $606 million (13.4% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2015. SG&A for 2016 and 2015 included $20 million and $14 million, respectively, of severance and restructuring charges resulting from cost reduction efforts. SG&A for 2016 also included $15 million of expense related to the implementation of a new information technology system in the international segment as compared to $9 million of expense in 2015. The full year 2016 reflected a $6 million favorable impact from foreign exchange rates compared to the full year of 2015. Excluding these amounts, SG&A decreased $88 million which was attributable to volume-related declines and the cost reduction efforts we have made.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\ufeff\nGoodwill and Intangibles Asset Impairment. In December 2015, because of the continued decline in commodity prices and activity levels, we performed an assessment of current market conditions and our future long-term expectations of oil and gas markets and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units were lower than their carrying values. Our assessment took into consideration, among other things, significant further reductions in projected spending by our customers in 2016 and a more pessimistic long-term outlook for the price of oil and natural gas, and the resulting impact on our 2016 budget and long-term financial forecast. As a result of this assessment, we completed an interim goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2015. This test resulted in an impairment charge of $292 million comprised of $109 million in our U.S. reporting unit and $183 million in our International reporting unit. No such charges were incurred in 2016.\n\ufeff\nAs a result of these same factors, we performed impairment tests of other intangible assets as well and incurred impairment charges of $128 million related to our indefinite-lived trade name within our U.S. segment and $42 million related to the customer base intangible assets within our International segment. No such charges were incurred in 2016.\nOperating Loss. Operating loss was $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared $282 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an improvement of $226 million.\nU.S. Segment-Our U.S. segment had operating income of $6 million for 2016 as compared to an operating loss of $47 million for 2015. Excluding the $237 million of goodwill and intangible asset impairments in 2015, the decline of $184 million was primarily driven by lower revenue due to decreased customer spending offset by a reduction in SG&A expenses. In addition, severance and restructuring expenses and inventory-related charges negatively impacted operating income by $22 million and $6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nCanadian Segment-Our Canadian segment incurred an operating loss of $5 million for 2016 as compared to operating income of $9 million for 2015. The decrease of $14 million reflected the decline in sales offset by corresponding reductions in SG&A. Severance and restructuring expenses and inventory-related charges negatively impacted operating income by $6 million and $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nInternational Segment-Our International segment incurred an operating loss of $57 million for 2016 as compared to an operating loss of $244 million in 2015. Excluding the $225 million of goodwill and intangibles impairment charges in 2015, the $38 million decrease was a result of lower sales offset by corresponding reductions in SG&A. Severance and restructuring expenses and inventory-related charges negatively impacted operating income by $37 million and $7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nInterest Expense. Our interest expense was $35 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $48 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease can be attributed to lower average debt levels in 2016.\nOther Expense. Our other expense decreased to $0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. In 2015, other expense included $5 million of expense related to the disposition of our U.S. OCTG product line, a $3 million write off of debt issuance costs, foreign currency losses of $3 million, and a $3 million charge related to a litigation matter. In 2016, we had no such charges.\nIncome Tax Benefit. Our income tax benefit was $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to benefit of $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our effective tax rates were 9% and 3% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These rates generally differ from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% as a result of state income taxes and differing, generally lower, foreign income tax rates. The 2016 effective tax rate of 9% was lower than our customary effective tax rate as a result of the mix of pre-tax losses in all segments, including an increase in the relative significance of pre-tax losses in foreign jurisdictions where the losses have no corresponding tax benefit. The 2015 effective tax rate of 3% was lower than our customary effective tax rate primarily due to the a non-tax deductible impairment charge combined with tax expense related to provisions for valuation allowances and the mix of income and losses in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.\nNet Loss. Our net loss was $83 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $331 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an improvement of $248 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $75 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $235 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our Adjusted EBITDA decreased $160 million over that period primarily as a result of the factors noted above.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, amortization of intangibles and certain other expenses, including non-cash expenses, (such as equity-based compensation, severance and restructuring, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments and asset impairments, including inventory) and plus or minus the impact of our LIFO inventory costing methodology.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors a helpful measure for comparing our operating performance with the performance of other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. We believe that net income is the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles that is most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA.\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, with our net loss, as derived from our consolidated financial statements (in millions):\nTable 26: <table> <tr>

Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to an equivalent GAAP measure, see pages 36-38 herein.\nSales. Our sales were $4,529 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $5,933 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $1,404 million decrease reflected a $162 million impact of the decline in foreign currencies in areas where we operate compared to the U.S. dollar.\nU.S. Segment-Our U.S. sales decreased $855 million to $3,572 million for 2015 from $4,427 million for 2014. This 19% decrease reflected a $659 million, or 36%, decrease in the upstream sector, a $167 million, or 10%, decrease in the midstream sector and a modest decline in the downstream sector. The decline in all sectors reflects the decrease in customer spending related to the decline in oil and natural gas prices and the resulting decline in rig count.\nCanadian Segment-Our Canadian sales decreased $300 million to $333 million for 2015 from $633 million for 2014. This 47% decrease reflected a $276 million, or 53%, decrease in upstream business due to a decrease in customer spending. Approximately $51 million, or 17%, of the total decline was a result of the weaker Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.\nInternational Segment-Our International sales decreased $249 million to $624 million for 2015 from $873 million for 2014. This 29% decrease reflected the combined impact of lower project activity and deferral of MRO expenditures particularly in Norway, the U.K., Australia and the Netherlands. The decrease in sales included the impact of the decline in the foreign currencies in areas where we operate compared to the U.S. dollar, which accounted for $111 million, or 45%, of the total decline.\nGross Profit. Our gross profit was $786 million (17.4% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $1,018 million (17.2% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2014. Gross profit for 2015 benefited from lower product costs reflected in our last-in first-out ( LIFO\u201d) inventory costing methodology. LIFO resulted in a reduction in cost of sales of $53 million in 2015 as compared to an increase in cost of sales of $12 million in 2014. Excluding the impact of LIFO, gross profit declined 120 basis points primarily as the result of the impact of customer pricing pressures related to the decline in oil prices and sales mix changes.\nCertain purchasing costs and warehousing activities (including receiving, inspection, and stocking costs), as well as general warehousing expenses, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses and not in cost of sales. As such, our gross profit may not be comparable to others who may include these expenses as a component of costs of goods sold. Purchasing and warehousing activities costs approximated $37 million and $46 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAdjusted Gross Profit. Adjusted Gross Profit decreased to $814 million (18.0% of sales) for 2015 from $1,120 million (18.9% of sales) for 2014, a decrease of $306 million. Adjusted Gross Profit is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted Gross Profit as sales, less cost of sales, plus depreciation and amortization, plus amortization of intangibles, and plus or minus the impact of our LIFO inventory costing methodology. We present Adjusted Gross Profit because we believe it is a useful indicator of our operating performance without regard to items, such as amortization of intangibles, that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon the nature and extent of acquisitions they have been involved in. Similarly, the impact of the LIFO inventory costing method can cause results to vary substantially from company to company depending upon whether they elect to utilize LIFO and depending upon which method they may elect. We use Adjusted Gross Profit as a key performance indicator in managing our business. We believe that gross profit is the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles that is most directly comparable to Adjusted Gross Profit.\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted Gross Profit, a non-GAAP financial measure, with our gross profit, as derived from our consolidated financial statements (in millions):\n\ufeff\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPercentage\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPercentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nof Revenue\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nof Revenue\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross profit, as reported\n</td> <td>\n$ 786\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>17.4% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 1,018\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>17.2% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>21 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>0.5% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>22 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>0.4% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmortization of intangibles\n</td> <td>60 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1.3% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>68 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1.1% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Decrease) increase in LIFO reserve\n</td> <td>(53) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(1.2%) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>12 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>0.2% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdjusted Gross Profit\n</td> <td>\n$ 814\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>18.0% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 1,120\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>18.9% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expenses. Our SG&A expenses were $606 million (13.4% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $716 million (12.1% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2014. Included within our 2015 SG&A expenses were $14 million of severance and restructuring charges resulting from cost reduction efforts as well as $5 million of incremental expense related to our MSD Engineering and Hypteck acquisitions. Included within our 2014 SG&A expenses were $8 million of severance and related costs and $6 million of charges related to the cancellation of certain executive employment agreements, $3 million of which represents the accelerated recognition of equity-based compensation expense. Excluding these amounts, SG&A decreased $115 million. Approximately $37 million of the decrease was due to the impact of weaker foreign currencies in the countries in which we operate relative to the U.S. dollar. The remaining decrease was attributable to volume-related declines and the cost reduction efforts we have made.\n\ufeff\nGoodwill and Intangibles Asset Impairment. In December 2015, because of the continued decline in commodity prices and activity levels, we performed an assessment of current market conditions and our future long-term expectations of oil and gas markets and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units were lower than their carrying values. Our assessment took into consideration, among other things, significant further reductions in projected spending by our customers in 2016 and a more pessimistic long-term outlook for the price of oil and natural gas, and the resulting impact on our 2016 budget and long-term financial forecast. As a result of this assessment, we completed an interim goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2015. This test resulted in an impairment charge of $292 million comprised of $109 million in our U.S. reporting unit and $183 million in our International reporting unit.\n\ufeff\nAs a result of these same factors, we performed impairment tests of other intangible assets as well and incurred impairment charges of $128 million related to our indefinite-lived trade name within our U.S. segment and $42 million related to the customer base intangible assets within our International segment.\nOperating (Loss) Income. Operating loss was $282 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to operating income of $302 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $584 million.\nU.S. Segment-Our U.S. segment incurred an operating loss of $47 million for 2015 as compared to operating income of $266 million for 2014. Excluding the $237 million of goodwill and intangible asset impairment, the decline of $76 million was driven by lower sales due to decreased customer spending offset by a reduction in SG&A expenses. Severance expenses negatively impacted operating income by $6 million and $7 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCanadian Segment-Operating income for our Canadian segment decreased to $9 million for 2015 from $28 million for 2014. The decrease of $19 million reflected the decline in sales offset by corresponding reductions in SG&A. Severance expenses negatively impacted operating income by $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nInternational Segment-Our International segment incurred an operating loss of $244 million for 2015 as compared to operating income of $8 million in 2014. Excluding the $225 million of goodwill and intangibles impairment charges, the $27 million decrease\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nwas a result of lower sales offset by corresponding reductions in SG&A. Severance expenses negatively impacted operating income by $7 million and $3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nInterest Expense. Our interest expense was $48 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $62 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease can be attributed to lower average debt levels in 2015. During 2015, total debt was reduced by $930 million with $355 million of net proceeds from our June 2015 Preferred Stock issuance combined with positive cash flows from operations.\nOther Income (Expense). Our other expense decreased to $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $14 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. In 2015, other expense included $5 million of expense related to our disposition of the OCTG business, a $3 million write off of debt issuance costs and foreign currency losses of $3 million as compared to a foreign currency loss of $3 million and a $1 million loss on the change of fair value derivatives in 2014. Additionally, the 2015 expenses included a $3 million charge related to a litigation matter while the 2014 expenses included a $6 million charge related to the sale of our Canadian progressive captivity pump business as well as a $4 million charge related to the loss on the disposition of our rolled and welded business.\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense). Our income tax benefit was $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to expense of $82 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our effective tax rates were 3% and 36% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These rates generally differ from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% as a result of state income taxes and differing, generally lower, foreign income tax rates. The change in the effective income tax rate between fiscal year 2015 and 2014 was primarily due to a non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge during the last quarter of 2015, tax expense during fiscal year 2015 related to provision for valuation allowances and the mix of income and losses in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate.\nNet (Loss) Income. Our net loss was $331 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to net income of $144 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $475 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $235 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $424 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our Adjusted EBITDA decreased $189 million over that period primarily as a result of the factors noted above.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, amortization of intangibles and certain other expenses, including non-cash expenses, (such as equity-based compensation, severance and restructuring, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments and asset impairments, including inventory) and plus or minus the impact of our LIFO inventory costing methodology.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors a helpful measure for comparing our operating performance with the performance of other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. We believe that net income is the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles that is most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, with our net (loss) income, as derived from our consolidated financial statements (in millions):\n\ufeff\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet (loss) income\n</td> <td>\n$ (331)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 144\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\n</td> <td>(11) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>82 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>48 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>62 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>21 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>22 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmortization of intangibles\n</td> <td>60 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>68 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Decrease) increase in LIFO reserve\n</td> <td>(53) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>12 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGoodwill and intangible asset impairment\n</td> <td>462 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEquity-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>10 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>9 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSeverance and restructuring charges\n</td> <td>14 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>8 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoss on disposition of non-core product lines\n</td> <td>5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>10 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nForeign currency losses\n</td> <td>3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWrite off of debt issuance costs\n</td> <td>3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLitigation matter\n</td> <td>3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nChange in fair value of derivative instruments\n</td> <td>1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCancellation of executive employment agreements (cash portion)\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n$ 235\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 424\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancial Condition and Cash Flows\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth our cash flows for the periods indicated below (in millions):\n\ufeff\nTable 30: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating activities\n</td> <td>\n$ 253\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 690\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ (106)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvesting activities\n</td> <td>16 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(41) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(362) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFinancing activities\n</td> <td>(226) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(599) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>467 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n$ 43\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 50\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $253 million in 2016 compared to $690 million provided by operations in 2015. The decrease in cash provided by operations was primarily the result of reduced profitability combined with a reduction in the pace of working capital contraction in response to slowing sales. Excluding cash, working capital decreased $316 million in 2016 (from 2015) as compared to a decrease of $588 million in 2015 (from 2014). The current year decline in working capital was impacted most significantly by a $141 million and $128 million reduction in inventory and accounts receivable, respectively, caused by declining sales levels. We continue to actively manage our working capital to an appropriate level given current market conditions.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $690 million in 2015 compared to $106 million used in operations in 2014. The $796 million increase in net cash provided by operations was primarily the result of reduced working capital requirements. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, working capital decreased $543 million in 2015 (from 2014) as compared to an increase of $289 million in 2014 (from 2013). The 2015 decline in working capital was impacted most significantly by a $419 million and $412 million reduction in inventory and accounts receivable, respectively, caused by declining sales levels.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $16 million in 2016, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $41 million in 2015. The $57 million increase in cash provided by investing activities is the result of $48 million in proceeds from the disposition of our U.S. OCTG product line. Our capital expenditures were $33 million and $39 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We expect capital expenditures in 2017 to be approximately $32 million.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nNet cash used in investing activities was $41 million in 2015, compared to $362 million in 2014. The $321 million decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the acquisitions of Stream AS, MSD Engineering Pte. Limited, and Hypteck AS which required cash of $344 million in 2014. Our capital expenditures were $39 million in 2015 and $20 million in 2014. The 2015 increase in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to our implementation of a new information technology system within our international segment.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $226 million in 2016, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $599 million in 2015. Net repayments on our Global ABL Facility totaled $0 million in 2016, compared to $673 million in the 2015. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we repaid $100 million of our Term Loan using available cash on hand. In 2016, we used $95 million and $24 million to fund purchases of our common stock and dividends on our preferred stock, respectively. In June 2015, we received $355 million of net proceeds related to the issuance of Series A Preferred Stock. We used these proceeds to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our Term Loan and our Global ABL Facility.\n\ufeff\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity consist of cash generated from our operating activities, existing cash balances and borrowings under our existing Global ABL Facility. At December 31, 2016, our total liquidity, including cash on hand, was $534 million. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from our operating activities is primarily dependent on our sales of products to our customers at profits sufficient to cover our fixed and variable expenses. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $109 million and $69 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, $61 million and $51 million of our cash and cash equivalents were maintained in the accounts of our various foreign subsidiaries and, if those amounts were transferred among countries or repatriated to the U.S., those amounts may be subject to additional tax liabilities, which would be recognized in our financial statements in the period during which the transfer decision was made. We currently have the intent and ability to indefinitely reinvest the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries, and there are currently no plans for the repatriation of those amounts.\nOur primary credit facilities consist of a seven-year Term Loan maturing in November 2019 with an original principal amount of $794 million and a five-year $1.05 billion Global ABL Facility that provides a $977 million facility in the United States, a $30 million facility in Norway, a $20 million facility in Canada, a $10 million facility in Australia, a $5 million facility in the United Kingdom, a $4 million facility in the Netherlands and a $4 million facility in Belgium. The Global ABL matures in July 2019. The Global ABL Facility contains an accordion feature that allows us to increase the principal amount of the facility by up to $300 million, subject to additional lender commitments. As of December 31, 2016, we had no outstanding borrowings and $425 million of Excess Availability, as defined under this Global ABL Facility. Availability is dependent on a borrowing base comprised of a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventory which is subject to redetermination from time to time. As of December 31, 2016, there was $414 million outstanding under the Term Loan, which matures on November 9, 2019.\nOur credit ratings are below investment grade\u201d and, as such, could impact both our ability to raise new funds as well as the interest rates on our future borrowings. Our existing obligations restrict our ability to incur additional debt. We were in compliance with the covenants contained in our various credit facilities as of and during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nWe believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy the anticipated cash requirements associated with our existing operations for at least the next twelve months. However, our future cash requirements could be higher than we currently expect as a result of various factors. Additionally, our ability to generate sufficient cash from our operating activities depends on our future performance, which is subject to general economic, political, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. We may from time to time seek to raise additional debt or equity financing in the public or private markets, based on market conditions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. We may also seek, from time to time, depending on market conditions, to refinance certain categories of our debt, and we may seek to consummate equity offerings. Any such transaction would be subject to market conditions, compliance with all of our credit agreements, and various other factors.\n\ufeff\nIn November 2015, the Company's board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for common stock up to $100 million, which was increased in November 2016 to $125 million. The program is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2017. The shares may be repurchased at management's discretion in the open market. Depending on market conditions and other factors, these repurchases may be commenced or suspended from time to time without prior notice. In 2016, we purchased 6,861,191 shares of common stock at a total cost of $95 million. In total under this plan, we have purchased 7,677,580 shares at a total cost of $107 million.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nContractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our minimum payment obligations as of December 31, 2016 relating to long-term debt, interest payments, capital leases, operating leases, purchase obligations and other long-term liabilities for the periods indicated (in millions):\n\ufeff\nTable 31: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nMore Than\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n2018-2019\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n2020-2021\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 414\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 8\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 406\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest payments (2)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>58 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>21 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>37 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating leases\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>185 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>40 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>55 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>36 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>54 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPurchase obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>180 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>180 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nForeign exchange forward contracts\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther long-term liabilities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>24 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>24 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 861\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 249\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 498\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 36\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 78\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\n(1) Long-term debt is based on debt outstanding at December 31, 2016.\n(2) Interest payments are based on interest rates in effect at December 31, 2016 and assume contractual amortization payments.\n(3) Purchase obligations reflect our commitments to purchase PVF products in the ordinary course of business. While our vendors often allow us to cancel these purchase orders without penalty, in certain cases cancellations may subject us to cancellation fees or penalties, depending on the terms of the contract.\nWe historically have been an acquisitive company. We expect to fund future acquisitions primarily from (i) borrowings, either the unused portion of our facilities or new debt issuances, (ii) cash provided by operations, or (iii) the issuance of additional equity in connection with the acquisitions.\nOther Commitments\nIn the normal course of business with customers, vendors and others, we are contingently liable for performance under standby letters of credit and bid, performance and surety bonds. We were contingently liable for approximately $61 million of standby letters of credit, trade guarantees that banks issue and bid, and performance and surety bonds at December 31, 2016. Management does not expect any material amounts to be drawn on these instruments.\nLegal Proceedings\nAsbestos Claims. We are one of many defendants in lawsuits that plaintiffs have brought seeking damages for personal injuries that exposure to asbestos allegedly caused. Plaintiffs and their family members have brought these lawsuits against a large volume of defendant entities as a result of the various defendants' manufacture, distribution, supply or other involvement with asbestos, asbestos-containing products or equipment or activities that allegedly caused plaintiffs to be exposed to asbestos. These plaintiffs typically assert exposure to asbestos as a consequence of third-party manufactured products that the Company's subsidiary, MRC Global (US) Inc., purportedly distributed. As of December 31, 2016, we are a named defendant in approximately 510 lawsuits involving approximately 1,130 claims. No asbestos lawsuit has resulted in a judgment against us to date, with the majority being settled, dismissed or otherwise resolved. Applicable third-party insurance has substantially covered these claims, and insurance should continue to cover a substantial majority of existing and anticipated future claims. Accordingly, we have recorded a liability for our estimate of the most likely settlement of asserted claims and a related receivable from insurers for our estimated recovery, to the extent we believe that the amounts of recovery are probable.\n\ufeff\nWe annually conduct analyses of our asbestos-related litigation to estimate the adequacy of the reserve for pending and probable asbestos-related claims. Given these estimated reserves and existing insurance coverage that has been available to cover substantial portions of these claims, we believe that our current accruals and associated estimates relating to pending and probable asbestos-related litigation likely to be asserted over the next 15 years are currently adequate. This belief, however, relies on a number of assumptions, including:\n\ufeff\nTable 32: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThat our future settlement payments, disease mix and dismissal rates will be materially consistent with historic experience;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 33: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThat future incidences of asbestos-related diseases in the U.S. will be materially consistent with current public health estimates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 34: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThat the rates at which future asbestos-related mesothelioma incidences result in compensable claims filings against us will be materially consistent with its historic experience;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nTable 35: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThat insurance recoveries for settlement payments and defense costs will be materially consistent with historic experience;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 36: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThat legal standards (and the interpretation of these standards) applicable to asbestos litigation will not change in material respects;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 37: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThat there are no materially negative developments in the claims pending against us; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 38: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThat key co-defendants in current and future claims remain solvent.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf any of these assumptions prove to be materially different in light of future developments, liabilities related to asbestos-related litigation may be materially different than amounts accrued or estimated. Further, while we anticipate that additional claims will be filed in the future, we are unable to predict with any certainty the number, timing and magnitude of such future claims. In our opinion, there are no pending legal proceedings that are likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\nOther Legal Claims and Proceedings. From time to time, we have been subject to various claims and involved in legal proceedings incidental to the nature of our businesses. We maintain insurance coverage to reduce financial risk associated with certain of these claims and proceedings. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these claims and proceedings. However, in our opinion, there are no pending legal proceedings that are likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. See also Note 16-Commitments and Contingencies\u201d to the audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2016.\n\ufeff\nProduct Claims. From time to time, in the ordinary course of our business, our customers may claim that the products that we distribute are either defective or require repair or replacement under warranties that either we or the manufacturer may provide to the customer. These proceedings are, in the opinion of management, ordinary and routine matters incidental to our normal business. Our purchase orders with our suppliers generally require the manufacturer to indemnify us against any product liability claims, leaving the manufacturer ultimately responsible for these claims. In many cases, state, provincial or foreign law provides protection to distributors for these sorts of claims, shifting the responsibility to the manufacturer. In some cases, we could be required to repair or replace the products for the benefit of our customer and seek our recovery from the manufacturer for our expense. In our opinion, there are no pending legal proceedings that are likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\nWeatherford Claim. In addition to PVF, our Canadian subsidiary, Midfield Supply ( Midfield\u201d), now known as MRC Canada, also distributed progressive cavity pumps and related equipment ( PCPs\u201d) under a distribution agreement with Weatherford Canada Partnership ( Weatherford\u201d) within a certain geographical area located in southern Alberta, Canada. Commencing in late 2005 and into early 2006, Midfield hired new employees, including individuals who left Weatherford, as part of Midfield's desire to expand its PVF business into northern Alberta. Shortly thereafter, many of these employees left Midfield and formed a PCP manufacturing, distribution and service company named Europump Systems Inc. ( Europump\u201d) in 2006. The distribution agreement with Weatherford expired in 2006. Midfield supplied Europump with PVF products that Europump distributed along with sales of PCP pumps. In April 2007, Midfield purchased Europump's distribution branches and began distributing and servicing Europump PCPs. In 2014, the Company divested its PCP business to Europump, which Halliburton Corporation subsequently purchased.\n\ufeff\nPursuant to a complaint that Weatherford filed on April 11, 2006 in the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta, Judicial Bench of Edmonton (Action No. 060304628), Weatherford sued Europump, three of Europump's part suppliers, Midfield, certain current and former employees of Midfield, as well as other entities related to these parties, asserting a host of claims including breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, misappropriation of confidential information related to the PCPs, unlawful interference with economic relations and conspiracy. The Company denies these allegations and contends that Midfield's expansion and subsequent growth was the result of fair competition.\n\ufeff\nFrom 2006 through 2012, the case focused largely on Weatherford's questioning of defense witnesses. In 2013, the defendants began substantive questioning of Weatherford and its witnesses. Discovery is ongoing and expected to last through early 2017. In April 2016, the court dismissed two suppliers from the case. Weatherford has appealed this dismissal. The case is scheduled for trial in March 2018.\n\ufeff\nWhile the Company believes Weatherford's claims are without merit and we intend to defend against them vigorously, in November 2015, the Company filed with the Court a formal offer of settlement for $2 million plus one half of the Weatherford party's costs and interest under the Judgment Interest Act. Weatherford declined to accept the offer. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had recorded a reserve of $3 million associated with this claim.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements\u201d as such term is defined within the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. To apply these principles, management must make judgments and assumptions and develop estimates based on the best available information at the time. Actual results may differ based on the accuracy of the information utilized and subsequent events. The notes to our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this report describe our accounting policies. These critical accounting policies could materially affect the amounts recorded in our financial statements. We believe the following describes significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\nInventories: Our U.S. inventories are valued at the lower of cost (principally using the LIFO method) or market. We record an estimate each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation and estimated year-end inventory balances. These estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. Our inventories that are held outside of the U.S., totaling $164 million and $242 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were valued at the lower of weighted-average cost or estimated net realizable value.\nUnder the LIFO inventory valuation method, changes in the cost of inventory are recognized in cost of sales in the current period even though these costs may have been incurred at significantly different values. Since the Company values most of its inventory using the LIFO inventory costing methodology, a rise in inventory costs has a negative effect on operating results, while, conversely, a fall in inventory costs results in a benefit to operating results.\nWe determine reserves for inventory based on historical usage of inventory on-hand, assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Customers rely on the company to stock specialized items for certain projects and other needs. Therefore, the estimated carrying value of inventory depends upon demand driven by oil and gas spending activity, which in turn depends on oil and gas prices, the general outlook for economic growth worldwide, political stability in major oil and gas producing areas, and the potential obsolescence of various inventory items we sell. Because of the sustained low oil and gas prices, we incurred inventory-related charges totaling $45 million during the third quarter of 2016. These charges reflect adjustments necessary to reduce the carrying value of certain products determined to be excess or obsolete to their estimated net realizable value based on our current market outlook for those products. This amount includes $24 million in the International segment primarily related to a restructuring of our Australian business and market conditions in Iraq. In addition, reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were increased in the U.S. and Canada by $16 million and $5 million in 2016, respectively.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets: We record goodwill and intangible assets in conjunction with acquisitions that we make. These assets comprise 41% of our total assets as of December 31, 2016. We record goodwill as the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets that we acquire. We record intangible assets at fair value at the date of acquisition and amortize the value of intangible assets over the assets' estimated useful lives unless we determine that an asset has an indefinite life. We make significant judgments and estimates in both calculating the fair value of these assets and determining their estimated useful lives. The carrying values of our goodwill and intangible assets, by reporting unit, were as follows as of December 31, 2016 (in millions):\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 39: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nU.S. Eastern Region and Gulf Coast\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nU.S. Western Region\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nCanada\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nInternational\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCustomer base intangibles\n</td> <td>\n$ 159\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 101\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 6\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 13\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 279\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIndefinite lived trade name\n</td> <td>81 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>51 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>132 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGoodwill\n</td> <td>289 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>152 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>41 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>482 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets:\nOur long-lived assets consist primarily of:\nTable 40: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncustomer base intangibles; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 41: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nproperty, plant and equipment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe carrying value of these assets is subject to an impairment test when circumstances indicate a possible impairment. These circumstances would include significant decreases in our operating results and significant changes in market demand for our products and services. When events and circumstances indicate a possible impairment, we assess recoverability from future operations using an undiscounted cash flow analysis, derived from the lowest appropriate asset group. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, we would recognize an impairment charge to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe group customer base intangible assets on a basis consistent with our reporting units. We determine the fair value of customer base intangibles using a discounted cash flow analysis. The most significant factor in the determination of the fair value of our customer base intangibles is forecasted sales to our customers including, in particular, our largest customers. Possible indicators of impairment could include the following:\nTable 42: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nprolonged decline in commodity oil and natural gas prices,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 43: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe resulting decline in activity levels of many of our major customers,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 44: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nsignificant reductions in capital spending budgets of our customers; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 45: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\na pessimistic outlook for the price of oil and natural gas.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAlthough we determined there were no impairments in 2016, significant decreases in our forecasted sales, particularly with our largest customers, could result in future impairments of our customer base intangible assets.\nThe carrying value of property, plant and equipment as of December 31, 2016 was $135 million, or 6% of total assets. This amount was comprised of $92 million, $20 million and $23 million in our U.S., Canada and International segments, respectively. We group property, plant and equipment and evaluate it for recoverability at a country or regional level. We determine the fair value of property, plant and equipment based on appraisal procedures which involve both market and cost techniques depending on the nature of the specific assets and the availability of market information. In 2016, no indicators of property, plant and equipment impairment were present. Based on the nature of our property, plant and equipment and the reduction in carrying value each year through depreciation, we believe future impairments are not likely.\nWhen testing for the impairment of the value of long-lived assets, we make forecasts of:\nTable 46: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nour future operating results,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 47: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe extent and timing of future cash flows,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 48: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nworking capital,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 49: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nprofitability; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 50: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nsales growth trends.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe make these forecasts using the best available information at the time, including information regarding current market conditions and customer spending forecasts. While we believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable, because of the volatile nature of the energy industry, actual results may differ materially from the projected results which could result in the recognition of additional impairment charges. Factors that could lead to actual results differing materially from projected results include, among other things, further reductions of oil and natural gas prices and changes in projected sales growth rates.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets: We test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment annually, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at four reporting units (U.S. Eastern Region and Gulf Coast, U.S. Western Region, Canada and International). Within each reporting unit, we have elected to aggregate the component countries and regions into a single reporting unit based on their similar economic characteristics, products, customers, suppliers, methods of distribution and the manner in which we operate each segment. We perform our annual tests for indications of goodwill impairment as of October 1st of each year, updating on an interim basis should indications of impairment exist.\nWhen we perform the goodwill impairment test, we compare the carrying value of the reporting unit that has the goodwill with the estimated fair value of that reporting unit. If the carrying value is more than the estimated fair value, a second step is performed. In the second step, we calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. We recognize impairment losses to the extent that recorded goodwill exceeds implied goodwill. Our impairment methodology uses discounted cash flow and multiples of cash earnings valuation techniques, acquisition control premium and valuation comparisons to similar businesses to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. Each of these methods involves Level 3 unobservable market inputs and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding:\nTable 51: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nfuture operating results,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 52: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe extent and timing of future cash flows,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 53: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nworking capital,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 54: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nsales prices,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 55: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nprofitability,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 56: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ndiscount rates; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 57: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nsales growth trends.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe make these forecasts using the best available information at the time including information regarding current market conditions and customer spending forecasts. While we believe that these assumptions and estimates are reasonable, because of the volatile nature of the energy industry, actual results may differ materially from the projected results which could result in the recognition of additional impairment charges. Factors that could lead to actual results differing materially from projected results include, among other things:\nTable 58: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nreduction of oil and natural gas prices,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 59: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nchanges in projected sales growth rate; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 60: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nchanges in factors affecting our discount rate including risk premiums, risk free interest rates and costs of capital.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn connection with our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2016, we tested the carrying value of goodwill for our U.S. and International reporting units. Our Canada reporting unit has no goodwill. No goodwill impairments were indicated as a result of those tests as the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value.\nIntangible assets with indefinite useful lives are recorded in our U.S. segment. We test these assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. This test compares the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets with their estimated fair value. If the carrying value is more than the estimated fair value, we recognize impairment losses in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value. Our impairment methodology uses discounted cash flow and estimated royalty rate valuation techniques. Utilizing these valuation methods, we make certain assumptions and estimates regarding:\nTable 61: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nfuture operating results,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 62: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nsales prices,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ndiscount rates; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nsales growth trends.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nAs with the goodwill impairment test described above, while we believe that our assumptions and estimates are reasonable, because of the volatile nature of the energy industry, actual results may differ materially from the projected results which could result in the recognition of additional impairment charges. No impairment charges were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2016. The estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets substantially exceeded their carrying value.\nIncome Taxes: We use the liability method for determining our income taxes, under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates. Under this method, the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the tax rate expected to be in effect when the taxes will actually be paid or refunds received. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nIn determining the need for valuation allowances and our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, we consider and make judgments regarding all the available positive and negative evidence, including the timing of the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, estimated future taxable income, ongoing, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and recent financial results of operations. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable however could be adjusted in the future if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present in certain jurisdictions and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth.\nOur tax provision is based upon our expected taxable income and statutory rates in effect in each country in which we operate. We are subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and foreign tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the amount of income taxes we provide during any given year.\nA tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including any related appeals or litigation processes, on the basis of the technical merits. We adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which the new information is available.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax positions as income taxes in our financial statements. We intend to permanently reinvest certain earnings of our foreign subsidiaries in operations outside of the U.S., and accordingly, we have not provided for U.S. income taxes on such earnings.",

Our business is segregated into three geographic reportable segments, consisting of our U.S., Canada and International operations. We serve our customers from approximately 300 service locations. We offer a wide array of PVF and oilfield supplies encompassing a complete line of products from our global network of over 12,000 suppliers to our more than 17,000 customers. We are diversified by geography, the industry sectors we serve and the products we sell. We seek to provide best-in-class service to our customers by satisfying the most complex, multi-site needs of many of the largest companies in the energy sector as their primary PVF supplier. We believe the critical role we play in our customers' supply chain, together with our extensive product offering, broad global presence, customer-linked scalable information systems and efficient distribution capabilities, serve to solidify our long-standing customer relationships and drive our growth. As a result, we have an average relationship of over 25 years with our 25 largest customers.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nKey Drivers of Our Business\nOur revenue are predominantly derived from the sale of PVF and other oilfield and industrial supplies to the energy sector globally. Our business is, therefore, dependent upon both the current conditions and future prospects in the energy industry and, in particular, maintenance and expansionary operating and capital expenditures by our customers in the upstream, midstream and downstream sectors of the industry. We have seen customer spending fall off significantly beginning in late 2014 and continuing through 2016 as a result of lower oil and natural gas prices. Long-term growth in spending has been driven by several factors, including underinvestment in global energy infrastructure, growth in shale and unconventional exploration and production ( E&P\u201d) activity, and anticipated strength in the oil, natural gas, refined products and petrochemical sectors. The outlook for future oil, natural gas, refined products and petrochemical PVF spending is influenced by numerous factors, including the following:\n\ufeff\n\u2022Oil and Natural Gas Prices. Sales of PVF and related products to the oil and natural gas industry constitute over 90% of our sales. As a result, we depend upon the oil and natural gas industry and its ability and willingness to make maintenance and capital expenditures to explore for, produce and process oil, natural gas and refined products. Oil and natural gas prices, both current and projected, along with the costs necessary to produce oil and gas, impact other drivers of our business, including capital spending by customers, additions and maintenance to pipeline mileage, refinery utilization and petrochemical processing activity.\n\u2022Economic Conditions. The demand for the products we distribute is dependent on the general economy, the energy sector and other factors. Changes in the general economy or in the energy sector (domestically or internationally) can cause demand for the products we distribute to materially change.\n\u2022Manufacturer and Distributor Inventory Levels of PVF and Related Products. Manufacturer and distributor inventory levels of PVF and related products can change significantly from period to period. Increased inventory levels by manufacturers or other distributors can cause an oversupply of PVF and related products in the industry sectors we serve and reduce the prices that we are able to charge for the products we distribute. Reduced prices, in turn, would likely reduce our profitability. Conversely, decreased manufacturer inventory levels may ultimately lead to increased demand for our products and would likely result in increased sales volumes and overall profitability.\n\u2022 Steel Prices, Availability and Supply and Demand. Fluctuations in steel prices can lead to volatility in the pricing of the products we distribute, especially carbon steel tubular products, which can influence the buying patterns of our customers. A majority of the products we distribute contain various types of steel. The worldwide supply and demand for these products, or other steel products that we do not supply, impacts the pricing and availability of our products and, ultimately, our sales and operating profitability.\nRecent Trends and Outlook\nDuring 2016, the average oil price of West Texas Intermediate ( WTI\u201d) decreased to $43.29 per barrel compared to $48.66 per barrel in 2015. Natural gas prices decreased to an average price of $2.52/Mcf (Henry Hub) for 2016 compared to $2.62/Mcf (Henry Hub) for 2015. North American drilling rig activity decreased 45% in 2016 compared to 2015.\n\ufeff\nIn recent years, there has been an increase in the global supply of crude oil, including the contribution of U.S. shale oil, at a pace exceeding demand growth. This increase combined with a hesitance on the part of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC\u201d) to curb production triggered a dramatic decline in oil prices that began in late 2014, continued throughout 2015, and persists today, but supply and demand is expected to tighten with production cuts announced by OPEC in November 2016. This low price environment has, in turn, resulted in a dramatic decline in exploration and production ( E&P\u201d) capital spending by our customers, which directly impacts our business. In 2016, customer spending fell by 27%, following a 21% decline in 2015, which brought spending to its lowest levels since 2009. This marks the first time in nearly 30 years that global spending has been down in consecutive years. However, we are encouraged by recent improvements in oil prices and drilling activity and expect 2017 revenue to be higher than 2016. Prominent exploration and production ( E&P\u201d) spending surveys, which include many of our customers, indicate that 2017 spending will increase with more significant growth in 2018 and 2019. We expect our business to follow the same trend.\n\ufeff\nIn January 2017, a new U.S. President took office and new U.S. Congress was seated. They have publicly made statements regarding the desire to support United States energy producers, refocus the EPA on its core mission, focus on United States interests first and lessen the regulatory burden on businesses to create job growth. They have also announced an aggressive policy agenda to change the tax system, modify the relationships between the United States and other countries, cancel or modify trade treaties and remake relationships with other countries. Until specific laws are passed, executive actions are taken or federal regulatory action is enacted, it is unclear what impact these policies will have on our business. While at first impression these policies could decrease the regulatory and tax burden on our business and the businesses of our U.S. customers, increase oil and gas production in the U.S. and, as a result, our U.S. business activity and increase the sales of product from our U.S. suppliers, it is not clear that all impacts would be positive. However, in the absence of specifics and given the government's generally supportive stance for the oil and gas industry, and based on\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nE&P spending surveys and our customers' current outlook for oil and gas supply and demand, we expect our business to increase in 2017 with continued growth through 2018 and 2019.\n\ufeff\nWe have taken steps in 2016 to reduce our operating costs. We have maintained our hiring and salary freezes, which were implemented in 2015, and eliminated an additional 600 full-time positions and closed 30 branches in 2016. As a result of these actions, we recorded pre-tax severance and restructuring charges of $20 million in 2016. We have reduced our headcount by approximately 1,500 or 30%, and our number of branch locations by 74, or 31%, since June 2014. In addition to these efforts to address costs, we continuously manage our investment in working capital to an appropriate level based on current and forecasted sales volumes.\n\ufeff\nIn the third quarter of 2016, we incurred non-cash inventory-related charges totaling $45 million necessary to reduce the carrying value of certain products determined to be excess or obsolete to their estimated net realizable value based on our current market outlook for those products. This amount included $24 million in the International segment primarily related to a restructuring of our Australian business and market conditions in Iraq. Reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were increased in the U.S. and Canada by $16 million and $5 million, respectively.\n\ufeff\nIn August 2016, we announced a plan to restructure and downsize our Australian operations in response to the continued downturn in the oil and gas and mining industries in the region. As a result of this plan, we incurred $17 million of charges, including $10 million of inventory-related charges, $4 million of lease termination and property costs, $2 million of employee severance and $1 million of other relocation costs. These charges included $7 million of cash costs. The restructuring plan was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 2016. Elsewhere in our International segment, the United Kingdom's decision to exit the European Union ( Brexit\u201d) has created uncertainty around European currencies, along with uncertain effects of future trade and other cross border activities of the U.K. with the European Union and other countries. We expect a minimal impact on our business, and our regional distribution centers in both Bradford, U.K. and Rotterdam, Netherlands position us well to serve our customers in the U.K. and the European Union.\nWe determine backlog by the amount of unshipped customer orders, either specific or general in nature, which the customer may revise or cancel in certain instances. The table below details our backlog by segment (in millions):\n\n*Amounts excluded U.S. OCTG backlog of $0 million, $42 million, and $157 million for 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. We disposed of our U.S. OCTG product line in February 2016.\nApproximately 28% of our December 31, 2016 ending backlog was associated with one customer in our U.S. segment as the result of a significant ongoing customer project. There can be no assurance that the backlog amounts will ultimately be realized as revenue or that we will earn a profit on the backlog of orders, but we expect that substantially all of the sales in our backlog will be realized in 2017.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe following table shows key industry indicators for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014\nThe breakdown of our sales by sector for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was as follows (in millions):\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 the following table summarizes our results of operations (in millions):\n\ufeff\n\n(1)Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to an equivalent GAAP measure, see pages 32-34 herein.\nSales. Sales include the revenue recognized from the sales of the products we distribute, services we provide and freight billings to customers, less cash discounts taken by customers in return for their early payment. Our sales were $3,041 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $4,529 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $1,488 million decrease reflected a $24 million impact of the decline in foreign currencies in areas where we operate compared to the U.S. dollar.\nU.S. Segment-Our U.S. sales decreased $1,275 million to $2,297 million for 2016 from $3,572 for 2015. This 36% decrease reflected a $698 million decrease in the upstream sector, a $329 million decrease in the midstream sector and a $248 million decrease in the downstream sector. The decline in the upstream sector included a $287 million impact from the disposition of our U.S. OCTG product line. The remaining decrease in sales 2016 as compared 2015 was caused by decreased customer spending for both maintenance, repair and operations ( MRO\u201d) and projects, driven by the sustained low oil and natural gas prices and the resulting decline in rig count.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCanadian Segment-Our Canadian sales decreased $90 million to $243 million for 2016 from $333 million for 2015. This 27% decrease reflected a $79 million decrease in the upstream business also due to a decrease in customer spending. Approximately $10 million, or 11%, of the total decline was a result of the weaker Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.\nInternational Segment-Our International sales decreased $123 million to $501 million for 2016 from $624 million for 2015. This $123 million, or 20%, decrease reflected the combined impact of lower project activity and deferral of MRO expenditures particularly in Norway, Australia, the Netherlands, the U.K., and Singapore. The impact of the decline in the foreign currencies in areas where we operate outside of the U.S. dollar accounted for $14 million, or 11%, of the total decline.\nGross Profit. Our gross profit was $468 million (15.4% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $786 million (17.4% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $318 million decrease was primarily attributable to the reduction in sales volumes. In addition, gross profit for 2016 was negatively impacted by $45 million of inventory-related charges to reduce the carrying value of certain excess and obsolete inventory items to their realizable value. Gross profit for 2016 benefited modestly from lower product costs reflected in our last-in, first-out ( LIFO\u201d) inventory costing methodology. LIFO resulted in a reduction of cost of sales of $14 million and $53 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding the impact of LIFO and the inventory-related charges, gross profit percentage improved 20 basis points as a result of sales mix changes including the elimination of our lower margin OCTG product line.\nCertain purchasing costs and warehousing activities (including receiving, inspection, and stocking costs), as well as general warehousing expenses, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses and not in cost of sales. As such, our gross profit may not be comparable to others who may include these expenses as a component of costs of goods sold. Purchasing and warehousing activities costs approximated $30 million and $37 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nAdjusted Gross Profit. Adjusted Gross Profit decreased to $523 million (17.2% of sales) for 2016 from $814 million (18.0% of sales) for 2015, a decrease of $291 million. Adjusted Gross Profit for 2016 included the impact of the $45 million of inventory-related charges discussed above. Adjusted Gross Profit is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted Gross Profit as sales, less cost of sales, plus depreciation and amortization, plus amortization of intangibles, and plus or minus the impact of our LIFO inventory costing methodology. We present Adjusted Gross Profit because we believe it is a useful indicator of our operating performance without regard to items, such as amortization of intangibles, that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon the nature and extent of acquisitions. Similarly, the impact of the LIFO inventory costing method can cause results to vary substantially from company to company depending upon whether they elect to utilize LIFO and depending upon which method they may elect. We use Adjusted Gross Profit as a key performance indicator in managing our business. We believe that gross profit is the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles that is most directly comparable to Adjusted Gross Profit.\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted Gross Profit, a non-GAAP financial measure, with our gross profit, as derived from our consolidated financial statements (in millions):\n\ufeff\n\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expenses. Costs such as salaries, wages, employee benefits, rent, utilities, communications, insurance, fuel and taxes (other than state and federal income taxes) that are necessary to operate our branch and corporate operations are included in SG&A. Also contained in this category are certain items that are non-operational in nature, including certain costs of acquiring and integrating other businesses. Our SG&A expenses were $524 million (17.2% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $606 million (13.4% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2015. SG&A for 2016 and 2015 included $20 million and $14 million, respectively, of severance and restructuring charges resulting from cost reduction efforts. SG&A for 2016 also included $15 million of expense related to the implementation of a new information technology system in the international segment as compared to $9 million of expense in 2015. The full year 2016 reflected a $6 million favorable impact from foreign exchange rates compared to the full year of 2015. Excluding these amounts, SG&A decreased $88 million which was attributable to volume-related declines and the cost reduction efforts we have made.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\ufeff\nGoodwill and Intangibles Asset Impairment. In December 2015, because of the continued decline in commodity prices and activity levels, we performed an assessment of current market conditions and our future long-term expectations of oil and gas markets and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units were lower than their carrying values. Our assessment took into consideration, among other things, significant further reductions in projected spending by our customers in 2016 and a more pessimistic long-term outlook for the price of oil and natural gas, and the resulting impact on our 2016 budget and long-term financial forecast. As a result of this assessment, we completed an interim goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2015. This test resulted in an impairment charge of $292 million comprised of $109 million in our U.S. reporting unit and $183 million in our International reporting unit. No such charges were incurred in 2016.\n\ufeff\nAs a result of these same factors, we performed impairment tests of other intangible assets as well and incurred impairment charges of $128 million related to our indefinite-lived trade name within our U.S. segment and $42 million related to the customer base intangible assets within our International segment. No such charges were incurred in 2016.\nOperating Loss. Operating loss was $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared $282 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an improvement of $226 million.\nU.S. Segment-Our U.S. segment had operating income of $6 million for 2016 as compared to an operating loss of $47 million for 2015. Excluding the $237 million of goodwill and intangible asset impairments in 2015, the decline of $184 million was primarily driven by lower revenue due to decreased customer spending offset by a reduction in SG&A expenses. In addition, severance and restructuring expenses and inventory-related charges negatively impacted operating income by $22 million and $6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nCanadian Segment-Our Canadian segment incurred an operating loss of $5 million for 2016 as compared to operating income of $9 million for 2015. The decrease of $14 million reflected the decline in sales offset by corresponding reductions in SG&A. Severance and restructuring expenses and inventory-related charges negatively impacted operating income by $6 million and $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nInternational Segment-Our International segment incurred an operating loss of $57 million for 2016 as compared to an operating loss of $244 million in 2015. Excluding the $225 million of goodwill and intangibles impairment charges in 2015, the $38 million decrease was a result of lower sales offset by corresponding reductions in SG&A. Severance and restructuring expenses and inventory-related charges negatively impacted operating income by $37 million and $7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nInterest Expense. Our interest expense was $35 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $48 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease can be attributed to lower average debt levels in 2016.\nOther Expense. Our other expense decreased to $0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. In 2015, other expense included $5 million of expense related to the disposition of our U.S. OCTG product line, a $3 million write off of debt issuance costs, foreign currency losses of $3 million, and a $3 million charge related to a litigation matter. In 2016, we had no such charges.\nIncome Tax Benefit. Our income tax benefit was $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to benefit of $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our effective tax rates were 9% and 3% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These rates generally differ from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% as a result of state income taxes and differing, generally lower, foreign income tax rates. The 2016 effective tax rate of 9% was lower than our customary effective tax rate as a result of the mix of pre-tax losses in all segments, including an increase in the relative significance of pre-tax losses in foreign jurisdictions where the losses have no corresponding tax benefit. The 2015 effective tax rate of 3% was lower than our customary effective tax rate primarily due to the a non-tax deductible impairment charge combined with tax expense related to provisions for valuation allowances and the mix of income and losses in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.\nNet Loss. Our net loss was $83 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $331 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an improvement of $248 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $75 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $235 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our Adjusted EBITDA decreased $160 million over that period primarily as a result of the factors noted above.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, amortization of intangibles and certain other expenses, including non-cash expenses, (such as equity-based compensation, severance and restructuring, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments and asset impairments, including inventory) and plus or minus the impact of our LIFO inventory costing methodology.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors a helpful measure for comparing our operating performance with the performance of other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. We believe that net income is the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles that is most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA.\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, with our net loss, as derived from our consolidated financial statements (in millions):\n\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 the following table summarizes our results of operations (in millions):\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n(1)Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to an equivalent GAAP measure, see pages 36-38 herein.\nSales. Our sales were $4,529 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $5,933 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $1,404 million decrease reflected a $162 million impact of the decline in foreign currencies in areas where we operate compared to the U.S. dollar.\nU.S. Segment-Our U.S. sales decreased $855 million to $3,572 million for 2015 from $4,427 million for 2014. This 19% decrease reflected a $659 million, or 36%, decrease in the upstream sector, a $167 million, or 10%, decrease in the midstream sector and a modest decline in the downstream sector. The decline in all sectors reflects the decrease in customer spending related to the decline in oil and natural gas prices and the resulting decline in rig count.\nCanadian Segment-Our Canadian sales decreased $300 million to $333 million for 2015 from $633 million for 2014. This 47% decrease reflected a $276 million, or 53%, decrease in upstream business due to a decrease in customer spending. Approximately $51 million, or 17%, of the total decline was a result of the weaker Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.\nInternational Segment-Our International sales decreased $249 million to $624 million for 2015 from $873 million for 2014. This 29% decrease reflected the combined impact of lower project activity and deferral of MRO expenditures particularly in Norway, the U.K., Australia and the Netherlands. The decrease in sales included the impact of the decline in the foreign currencies in areas where we operate compared to the U.S. dollar, which accounted for $111 million, or 45%, of the total decline.\nGross Profit. Our gross profit was $786 million (17.4% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $1,018 million (17.2% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2014. Gross profit for 2015 benefited from lower product costs reflected in our last-in first-out ( LIFO\u201d) inventory costing methodology. LIFO resulted in a reduction in cost of sales of $53 million in 2015 as compared to an increase in cost of sales of $12 million in 2014. Excluding the impact of LIFO, gross profit declined 120 basis points primarily as the result of the impact of customer pricing pressures related to the decline in oil prices and sales mix changes.\nCertain purchasing costs and warehousing activities (including receiving, inspection, and stocking costs), as well as general warehousing expenses, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses and not in cost of sales. As such, our gross profit may not be comparable to others who may include these expenses as a component of costs of goods sold. Purchasing and warehousing activities costs approximated $37 million and $46 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAdjusted Gross Profit. Adjusted Gross Profit decreased to $814 million (18.0% of sales) for 2015 from $1,120 million (18.9% of sales) for 2014, a decrease of $306 million. Adjusted Gross Profit is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted Gross Profit as sales, less cost of sales, plus depreciation and amortization, plus amortization of intangibles, and plus or minus the impact of our LIFO inventory costing methodology. We present Adjusted Gross Profit because we believe it is a useful indicator of our operating performance without regard to items, such as amortization of intangibles, that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon the nature and extent of acquisitions they have been involved in. Similarly, the impact of the LIFO inventory costing method can cause results to vary substantially from company to company depending upon whether they elect to utilize LIFO and depending upon which method they may elect. We use Adjusted Gross Profit as a key performance indicator in managing our business. We believe that gross profit is the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles that is most directly comparable to Adjusted Gross Profit.\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted Gross Profit, a non-GAAP financial measure, with our gross profit, as derived from our consolidated financial statements (in millions):\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expenses. Our SG&A expenses were $606 million (13.4% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $716 million (12.1% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2014. Included within our 2015 SG&A expenses were $14 million of severance and restructuring charges resulting from cost reduction efforts as well as $5 million of incremental expense related to our MSD Engineering and Hypteck acquisitions. Included within our 2014 SG&A expenses were $8 million of severance and related costs and $6 million of charges related to the cancellation of certain executive employment agreements, $3 million of which represents the accelerated recognition of equity-based compensation expense. Excluding these amounts, SG&A decreased $115 million. Approximately $37 million of the decrease was due to the impact of weaker foreign currencies in the countries in which we operate relative to the U.S. dollar. The remaining decrease was attributable to volume-related declines and the cost reduction efforts we have made.\n\ufeff\nGoodwill and Intangibles Asset Impairment. In December 2015, because of the continued decline in commodity prices and activity levels, we performed an assessment of current market conditions and our future long-term expectations of oil and gas markets and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units were lower than their carrying values. Our assessment took into consideration, among other things, significant further reductions in projected spending by our customers in 2016 and a more pessimistic long-term outlook for the price of oil and natural gas, and the resulting impact on our 2016 budget and long-term financial forecast. As a result of this assessment, we completed an interim goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2015. This test resulted in an impairment charge of $292 million comprised of $109 million in our U.S. reporting unit and $183 million in our International reporting unit.\n\ufeff\nAs a result of these same factors, we performed impairment tests of other intangible assets as well and incurred impairment charges of $128 million related to our indefinite-lived trade name within our U.S. segment and $42 million related to the customer base intangible assets within our International segment.\nOperating (Loss) Income. Operating loss was $282 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to operating income of $302 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $584 million.\nU.S. Segment-Our U.S. segment incurred an operating loss of $47 million for 2015 as compared to operating income of $266 million for 2014. Excluding the $237 million of goodwill and intangible asset impairment, the decline of $76 million was driven by lower sales due to decreased customer spending offset by a reduction in SG&A expenses. Severance expenses negatively impacted operating income by $6 million and $7 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCanadian Segment-Operating income for our Canadian segment decreased to $9 million for 2015 from $28 million for 2014. The decrease of $19 million reflected the decline in sales offset by corresponding reductions in SG&A. Severance expenses negatively impacted operating income by $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nInternational Segment-Our International segment incurred an operating loss of $244 million for 2015 as compared to operating income of $8 million in 2014. Excluding the $225 million of goodwill and intangibles impairment charges, the $27 million decrease\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nwas a result of lower sales offset by corresponding reductions in SG&A. Severance expenses negatively impacted operating income by $7 million and $3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nInterest Expense. Our interest expense was $48 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $62 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease can be attributed to lower average debt levels in 2015. During 2015, total debt was reduced by $930 million with $355 million of net proceeds from our June 2015 Preferred Stock issuance combined with positive cash flows from operations.\nOther Income (Expense). Our other expense decreased to $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $14 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. In 2015, other expense included $5 million of expense related to our disposition of the OCTG business, a $3 million write off of debt issuance costs and foreign currency losses of $3 million as compared to a foreign currency loss of $3 million and a $1 million loss on the change of fair value derivatives in 2014. Additionally, the 2015 expenses included a $3 million charge related to a litigation matter while the 2014 expenses included a $6 million charge related to the sale of our Canadian progressive captivity pump business as well as a $4 million charge related to the loss on the disposition of our rolled and welded business.\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense). Our income tax benefit was $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to expense of $82 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our effective tax rates were 3% and 36% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These rates generally differ from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% as a result of state income taxes and differing, generally lower, foreign income tax rates. The change in the effective income tax rate between fiscal year 2015 and 2014 was primarily due to a non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge during the last quarter of 2015, tax expense during fiscal year 2015 related to provision for valuation allowances and the mix of income and losses in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate.\nNet (Loss) Income. Our net loss was $331 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to net income of $144 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $475 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $235 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $424 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our Adjusted EBITDA decreased $189 million over that period primarily as a result of the factors noted above.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, amortization of intangibles and certain other expenses, including non-cash expenses, (such as equity-based compensation, severance and restructuring, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments and asset impairments, including inventory) and plus or minus the impact of our LIFO inventory costing methodology.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors a helpful measure for comparing our operating performance with the performance of other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. We believe that net income is the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles that is most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, with our net (loss) income, as derived from our consolidated financial statements (in millions):\n\ufeff\n\nFinancial Condition and Cash Flows\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth our cash flows for the periods indicated below (in millions):\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $253 million in 2016 compared to $690 million provided by operations in 2015. The decrease in cash provided by operations was primarily the result of reduced profitability combined with a reduction in the pace of working capital contraction in response to slowing sales. Excluding cash, working capital decreased $316 million in 2016 (from 2015) as compared to a decrease of $588 million in 2015 (from 2014). The current year decline in working capital was impacted most significantly by a $141 million and $128 million reduction in inventory and accounts receivable, respectively, caused by declining sales levels. We continue to actively manage our working capital to an appropriate level given current market conditions.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $690 million in 2015 compared to $106 million used in operations in 2014. The $796 million increase in net cash provided by operations was primarily the result of reduced working capital requirements. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, working capital decreased $543 million in 2015 (from 2014) as compared to an increase of $289 million in 2014 (from 2013). The 2015 decline in working capital was impacted most significantly by a $419 million and $412 million reduction in inventory and accounts receivable, respectively, caused by declining sales levels.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $16 million in 2016, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $41 million in 2015. The $57 million increase in cash provided by investing activities is the result of $48 million in proceeds from the disposition of our U.S. OCTG product line. Our capital expenditures were $33 million and $39 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We expect capital expenditures in 2017 to be approximately $32 million.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nNet cash used in investing activities was $41 million in 2015, compared to $362 million in 2014. The $321 million decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the acquisitions of Stream AS, MSD Engineering Pte. Limited, and Hypteck AS which required cash of $344 million in 2014. Our capital expenditures were $39 million in 2015 and $20 million in 2014. The 2015 increase in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to our implementation of a new information technology system within our international segment.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $226 million in 2016, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $599 million in 2015. Net repayments on our Global ABL Facility totaled $0 million in 2016, compared to $673 million in the 2015. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we repaid $100 million of our Term Loan using available cash on hand. In 2016, we used $95 million and $24 million to fund purchases of our common stock and dividends on our preferred stock, respectively. In June 2015, we received $355 million of net proceeds related to the issuance of Series A Preferred Stock. We used these proceeds to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our Term Loan and our Global ABL Facility.\n\ufeff\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity consist of cash generated from our operating activities, existing cash balances and borrowings under our existing Global ABL Facility. At December 31, 2016, our total liquidity, including cash on hand, was $534 million. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from our operating activities is primarily dependent on our sales of products to our customers at profits sufficient to cover our fixed and variable expenses. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $109 million and $69 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, $61 million and $51 million of our cash and cash equivalents were maintained in the accounts of our various foreign subsidiaries and, if those amounts were transferred among countries or repatriated to the U.S., those amounts may be subject to additional tax liabilities, which would be recognized in our financial statements in the period during which the transfer decision was made. We currently have the intent and ability to indefinitely reinvest the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries, and there are currently no plans for the repatriation of those amounts.\nOur primary credit facilities consist of a seven-year Term Loan maturing in November 2019 with an original principal amount of $794 million and a five-year $1.05 billion Global ABL Facility that provides a $977 million facility in the United States, a $30 million facility in Norway, a $20 million facility in Canada, a $10 million facility in Australia, a $5 million facility in the United Kingdom, a $4 million facility in the Netherlands and a $4 million facility in Belgium. The Global ABL matures in July 2019. The Global ABL Facility contains an accordion feature that allows us to increase the principal amount of the facility by up to $300 million, subject to additional lender commitments. As of December 31, 2016, we had no outstanding borrowings and $425 million of Excess Availability, as defined under this Global ABL Facility. Availability is dependent on a borrowing base comprised of a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventory which is subject to redetermination from time to time. As of December 31, 2016, there was $414 million outstanding under the Term Loan, which matures on November 9, 2019.\nOur credit ratings are below investment grade\u201d and, as such, could impact both our ability to raise new funds as well as the interest rates on our future borrowings. Our existing obligations restrict our ability to incur additional debt. We were in compliance with the covenants contained in our various credit facilities as of and during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nWe believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy the anticipated cash requirements associated with our existing operations for at least the next twelve months. However, our future cash requirements could be higher than we currently expect as a result of various factors. Additionally, our ability to generate sufficient cash from our operating activities depends on our future performance, which is subject to general economic, political, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. We may from time to time seek to raise additional debt or equity financing in the public or private markets, based on market conditions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. We may also seek, from time to time, depending on market conditions, to refinance certain categories of our debt, and we may seek to consummate equity offerings. Any such transaction would be subject to market conditions, compliance with all of our credit agreements, and various other factors.\n\ufeff\nIn November 2015, the Company's board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for common stock up to $100 million, which was increased in November 2016 to $125 million. The program is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2017. The shares may be repurchased at management's discretion in the open market. Depending on market conditions and other factors, these repurchases may be commenced or suspended from time to time without prior notice. In 2016, we purchased 6,861,191 shares of common stock at a total cost of $95 million. In total under this plan, we have purchased 7,677,580 shares at a total cost of $107 million.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nContractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our minimum payment obligations as of December 31, 2016 relating to long-term debt, interest payments, capital leases, operating leases, purchase obligations and other long-term liabilities for the periods indicated (in millions):\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n(1) Long-term debt is based on debt outstanding at December 31, 2016.\n(2) Interest payments are based on interest rates in effect at December 31, 2016 and assume contractual amortization payments.\n(3) Purchase obligations reflect our commitments to purchase PVF products in the ordinary course of business. While our vendors often allow us to cancel these purchase orders without penalty, in certain cases cancellations may subject us to cancellation fees or penalties, depending on the terms of the contract.\nWe historically have been an acquisitive company. We expect to fund future acquisitions primarily from (i) borrowings, either the unused portion of our facilities or new debt issuances, (ii) cash provided by operations, or (iii) the issuance of additional equity in connection with the acquisitions.\nOther Commitments\nIn the normal course of business with customers, vendors and others,", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

Our business is segregated into three geographic reportable segments, consisting of our U.S., Canada and International operations. We serve our customers from approximately 300 service locations. We offer a wide array of PVF and oilfield supplies encompassing a complete line of products from our global network of over 12,000 suppliers to our more than 17,000 customers. We are diversified by geography, the industry sectors we serve and the products we sell. We seek to provide best-in-class service to our customers by satisfying the most complex, multi-site needs of many of the largest companies in the energy sector as their primary PVF supplier. We believe the critical role we play in our customers' supply chain, together with our extensive product offering, broad global presence, customer-linked scalable information systems and efficient distribution capabilities, serve to solidify our long-standing customer relationships and drive our growth. As a result, we have an average relationship of over 25 years with our 25 largest customers.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nKey Drivers of Our Business\nOur revenue are predominantly derived from the sale of PVF and other oilfield and industrial supplies to the energy sector globally. Our business is, therefore, dependent upon both the current conditions and future prospects in the energy industry and, in particular, maintenance and expansionary operating and capital expenditures by our customers in the upstream, midstream and downstream sectors of the industry. We have seen customer spending fall off significantly beginning in late 2014 and continuing through 2016 as a result of lower oil and natural gas prices. Long-term growth in spending has been driven by several factors, including underinvestment in global energy infrastructure, growth in shale and unconventional exploration and production ( E&P\u201d) activity, and anticipated strength in the oil, natural gas, refined products and petrochemical sectors. The outlook for future oil, natural gas, refined products and petrochemical PVF spending is influenced by numerous factors, including the following:\n\ufeff\n\u2022Oil and Natural Gas Prices. Sales of PVF and related products to the oil and natural gas industry constitute over 90% of our sales. As a result, we depend upon the oil and natural gas industry and its ability and willingness to make maintenance and capital expenditures to explore for, produce and process oil, natural gas and refined products. Oil and natural gas prices, both current and projected, along with the costs necessary to produce oil and gas, impact other drivers of our business, including capital spending by customers, additions and maintenance to pipeline mileage, refinery utilization and petrochemical processing activity.\n\u2022Economic Conditions. The demand for the products we distribute is dependent on the general economy, the energy sector and other factors. Changes in the general economy or in the energy sector (domestically or internationally) can cause demand for the products we distribute to materially change.\n\u2022Manufacturer and Distributor Inventory Levels of PVF and Related Products. Manufacturer and distributor inventory levels of PVF and related products can change significantly from period to period. Increased inventory levels by manufacturers or other distributors can cause an oversupply of PVF and related products in the industry sectors we serve and reduce the prices that we are able to charge for the products we distribute. Reduced prices, in turn, would likely reduce our profitability. Conversely, decreased manufacturer inventory levels may ultimately lead to increased demand for our products and would likely result in increased sales volumes and overall profitability.\n\u2022 Steel Prices, Availability and Supply and Demand. Fluctuations in steel prices can lead to volatility in the pricing of the products we distribute, especially carbon steel tubular products, which can influence the buying patterns of our customers. A majority of the products we distribute contain various types of steel. The worldwide supply and demand for these products, or other steel products that we do not supply, impacts the pricing and availability of our products and, ultimately, our sales and operating profitability.\nRecent Trends and Outlook\nDuring 2016, the average oil price of West Texas Intermediate ( WTI\u201d) decreased to $43.29 per barrel compared to $48.66 per barrel in 2015. Natural gas prices decreased to an average price of $2.52/Mcf (Henry Hub) for 2016 compared to $2.62/Mcf (Henry Hub) for 2015. North American drilling rig activity decreased 45% in 2016 compared to 2015.\n\ufeff\nIn recent years, there has been an increase in the global supply of crude oil, including the contribution of U.S. shale oil, at a pace exceeding demand growth. This increase combined with a hesitance on the part of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC\u201d) to curb production triggered a dramatic decline in oil prices that began in late 2014, continued throughout 2015, and persists today, but supply and demand is expected to tighten with production cuts announced by OPEC in November 2016. This low price environment has, in turn, resulted in a dramatic decline in exploration and production ( E&P\u201d) capital spending by our customers, which directly impacts our business. In 2016, customer spending fell by 27%, following a 21% decline in 2015, which brought spending to its lowest levels since 2009. This marks the first time in nearly 30 years that global spending has been down in consecutive years. However, we are encouraged by recent improvements in oil prices and drilling activity and expect 2017 revenue to be higher than 2016. Prominent exploration and production ( E&P\u201d) spending surveys, which include many of our customers, indicate that 2017 spending will increase with more significant growth in 2018 and 2019. We expect our business to follow the same trend.\n\ufeff\nIn January 2017, a new U.S. President took office and new U.S. Congress was seated. They have publicly made statements regarding the desire to support United States energy producers, refocus the EPA on its core mission, focus on United States interests first and lessen the regulatory burden on businesses to create job growth. They have also announced an aggressive policy agenda to change the tax system, modify the relationships between the United States and other countries, cancel or modify trade treaties and remake relationships with other countries. Until specific laws are passed, executive actions are taken or federal regulatory action is enacted, it is unclear what impact these policies will have on our business. While at first impression these policies could decrease the regulatory and tax burden on our business and the businesses of our U.S. customers, increase oil and gas production in the U.S. and, as a result, our U.S. business activity and increase the sales of product from our U.S. suppliers, it is not clear that all impacts would be positive. However, in the absence of specifics and given the government's generally supportive stance for the oil and gas industry, and based on\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nE&P spending surveys and our customers' current outlook for oil and gas supply and demand, we expect our business to increase in 2017 with continued growth through 2018 and 2019.\n\ufeff\nWe have taken steps in 2016 to reduce our operating costs. We have maintained our hiring and salary freezes, which were implemented in 2015, and eliminated an additional 600 full-time positions and closed 30 branches in 2016. As a result of these actions, we recorded pre-tax severance and restructuring charges of $20 million in 2016. We have reduced our headcount by approximately 1,500 or 30%, and our number of branch locations by 74, or 31%, since June 2014. In addition to these efforts to address costs, we continuously manage our investment in working capital to an appropriate level based on current and forecasted sales volumes.\n\ufeff\nIn the third quarter of 2016, we incurred non-cash inventory-related charges totaling $45 million necessary to reduce the carrying value of certain products determined to be excess or obsolete to their estimated net realizable value based on our current market outlook for those products. This amount included $24 million in the International segment primarily related to a restructuring of our Australian business and market conditions in Iraq. Reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were increased in the U.S. and Canada by $16 million and $5 million, respectively.\n\ufeff\nIn August 2016, we announced a plan to restructure and downsize our Australian operations in response to the continued downturn in the oil and gas and mining industries in the region. As a result of this plan, we incurred $17 million of charges, including $10 million of inventory-related charges, $4 million of lease termination and property costs, $2 million of employee severance and $1 million of other relocation costs. These charges included $7 million of cash costs. The restructuring plan was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 2016. Elsewhere in our International segment, the United Kingdom's decision to exit the European Union ( Brexit\u201d) has created uncertainty around European currencies, along with uncertain effects of future trade and other cross border activities of the U.K. with the European Union and other countries. We expect a minimal impact on our business, and our regional distribution centers in both Bradford, U.K. and Rotterdam, Netherlands position us well to serve our customers in the U.K. and the European Union.\nWe determine backlog by the amount of unshipped customer orders, either specific or general in nature, which the customer may revise or cancel in certain instances.

EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to an equivalent GAAP measure, see pages 32-34 herein.\nSales. Sales include the revenue recognized from the sales of the products we distribute, services we provide and freight billings to customers, less cash discounts taken by customers in return for their early payment. Our sales were $3,041 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $4,529 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $1,488 million decrease reflected a $24 million impact of the decline in foreign currencies in areas where we operate compared to the U.S. dollar.\nU.S. Segment-Our U.S. sales decreased $1,275 million to $2,297 million for 2016 from $3,572 for 2015. This 36% decrease reflected a $698 million decrease in the upstream sector, a $329 million decrease in the midstream sector and a $248 million decrease in the downstream sector. The decline in the upstream sector included a $287 million impact from the disposition of our U.S. OCTG product line. The remaining decrease in sales 2016 as compared 2015 was caused by decreased customer spending for both maintenance, repair and operations ( MRO\u201d) and projects, driven by the sustained low oil and natural gas prices and the resulting decline in rig count.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCanadian Segment-Our Canadian sales decreased $90 million to $243 million for 2016 from $333 million for 2015. This 27% decrease reflected a $79 million decrease in the upstream business also due to a decrease in customer spending. Approximately $10 million, or 11%, of the total decline was a result of the weaker Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.\nInternational Segment-Our International sales decreased $123 million to $501 million for 2016 from $624 million for 2015. This $123 million, or 20%, decrease reflected the combined impact of lower project activity and deferral of MRO expenditures particularly in Norway, Australia, the Netherlands, the U.K., and Singapore. The impact of the decline in the foreign currencies in areas where we operate outside of the U.S. dollar accounted for $14 million, or 11%, of the total decline.\nGross Profit. Our gross profit was $468 million (15.4% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $786 million (17.4% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $318 million decrease was primarily attributable to the reduction in sales volumes. In addition, gross profit for 2016 was negatively impacted by $45 million of inventory-related charges to reduce the carrying value of certain excess and obsolete inventory items to their realizable value. Gross profit for 2016 benefited modestly from lower product costs reflected in our last-in, first-out ( LIFO\u201d) inventory costing methodology. LIFO resulted in a reduction of cost of sales of $14 million and $53 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding the impact of LIFO and the inventory-related charges, gross profit percentage improved 20 basis points as a result of sales mix changes including the elimination of our lower margin OCTG product line.\nCertain purchasing costs and warehousing activities (including receiving, inspection, and stocking costs), as well as general warehousing expenses, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses and not in cost of sales. As such, our gross profit may not be comparable to others who may include these expenses as a component of costs of goods sold. Purchasing and warehousing activities costs approximated $30 million and $37 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nAdjusted Gross Profit. Adjusted Gross Profit decreased to $523 million (17.2% of sales) for 2016 from $814 million (18.0% of sales) for 2015, a decrease of $291 million. Adjusted Gross Profit for 2016 included the impact of the $45 million of inventory-related charges discussed above. Adjusted Gross Profit is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted Gross Profit as sales, less cost of sales, plus depreciation and amortization, plus amortization of intangibles, and plus or minus the impact of our LIFO inventory costing methodology. We present Adjusted Gross Profit because we believe it is a useful indicator of our operating performance without regard to items, such as amortization of intangibles, that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon the nature and extent of acquisitions. Similarly, the impact of the LIFO inventory costing method can cause results to vary substantially from company to company depending upon whether they elect to utilize LIFO and depending upon which method they may elect. We use Adjusted Gross Profit as a key performance indicator in managing our business. We believe that gross profit is the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles that is most directly comparable to Adjusted Gross Profit.\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted Gross Profit, a non-GAAP financial measure, with our gross profit, as derived from our consolidated financial statements (in millions):\n\ufeff\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPercentage\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPercentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nof Revenue\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nof Revenue\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross profit, as reported\n</td> <td>\n$ 468\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>15.4% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 786\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>17.4% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>22 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>0.7% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>21 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>0.5% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmortization of intangibles\n</td> <td>47 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1.6% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>60 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1.3% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDecrease in LIFO reserve\n</td> <td>(14) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(0.5%) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(53) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(1.2%) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdjusted Gross Profit\n</td> <td>\n$ 523\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>17.2% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 814\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>18.0% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expenses. Costs such as salaries, wages, employee benefits, rent, utilities, communications, insurance, fuel and taxes (other than state and federal income taxes) that are necessary to operate our branch and corporate operations are included in SG&A. Also contained in this category are certain items that are non-operational in nature, including certain costs of acquiring and integrating other businesses. Our SG&A expenses were $524 million (17.2% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $606 million (13.4% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2015. SG&A for 2016 and 2015 included $20 million and $14 million, respectively, of severance and restructuring charges resulting from cost reduction efforts. SG&A for 2016 also included $15 million of expense related to the implementation of a new information technology system in the international segment as compared to $9 million of expense in 2015. The full year 2016 reflected a $6 million favorable impact from foreign exchange rates compared to the full year of 2015. Excluding these amounts, SG&A decreased $88 million which was attributable to volume-related declines and the cost reduction efforts we have made.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\ufeff\nGoodwill and Intangibles Asset Impairment. In December 2015, because of the continued decline in commodity prices and activity levels, we performed an assessment of current market conditions and our future long-term expectations of oil and gas markets and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units were lower than their carrying values. Our assessment took into consideration, among other things, significant further reductions in projected spending by our customers in 2016 and a more pessimistic long-term outlook for the price of oil and natural gas, and the resulting impact on our 2016 budget and long-term financial forecast. As a result of this assessment, we completed an interim goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2015. This test resulted in an impairment charge of $292 million comprised of $109 million in our U.S. reporting unit and $183 million in our International reporting unit. No such charges were incurred in 2016.\n\ufeff\nAs a result of these same factors, we performed impairment tests of other intangible assets as well and incurred impairment charges of $128 million related to our indefinite-lived trade name within our U.S. segment and $42 million related to the customer base intangible assets within our International segment. No such charges were incurred in 2016.\nOperating Loss. Operating loss was $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared $282 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an improvement of $226 million.\nU.S. Segment-Our U.S. segment had operating income of $6 million for 2016 as compared to an operating loss of $47 million for 2015. Excluding the $237 million of goodwill and intangible asset impairments in 2015, the decline of $184 million was primarily driven by lower revenue due to decreased customer spending offset by a reduction in SG&A expenses. In addition, severance and restructuring expenses and inventory-related charges negatively impacted operating income by $22 million and $6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nCanadian Segment-Our Canadian segment incurred an operating loss of $5 million for 2016 as compared to operating income of $9 million for 2015. The decrease of $14 million reflected the decline in sales offset by corresponding reductions in SG&A. Severance and restructuring expenses and inventory-related charges negatively impacted operating income by $6 million and $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nInternational Segment-Our International segment incurred an operating loss of $57 million for 2016 as compared to an operating loss of $244 million in 2015. Excluding the $225 million of goodwill and intangibles impairment charges in 2015, the $38 million decrease was a result of lower sales offset by corresponding reductions in SG&A. Severance and restructuring expenses and inventory-related charges negatively impacted operating income by $37 million and $7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nInterest Expense. Our interest expense was $35 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $48 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease can be attributed to lower average debt levels in 2016.\nOther Expense. Our other expense decreased to $0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. In 2015, other expense included $5 million of expense related to the disposition of our U.S. OCTG product line, a $3 million write off of debt issuance costs, foreign currency losses of $3 million, and a $3 million charge related to a litigation matter. In 2016, we had no such charges.\nIncome Tax Benefit. Our income tax benefit was $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to benefit of $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our effective tax rates were 9% and 3% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These rates generally differ from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% as a result of state income taxes and differing, generally lower, foreign income tax rates. The 2016 effective tax rate of 9% was lower than our customary effective tax rate as a result of the mix of pre-tax losses in all segments, including an increase in the relative significance of pre-tax losses in foreign jurisdictions where the losses have no corresponding tax benefit. The 2015 effective tax rate of 3% was lower than our customary effective tax rate primarily due to the a non-tax deductible impairment charge combined with tax expense related to provisions for valuation allowances and the mix of income and losses in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.\nNet Loss. Our net loss was $83 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $331 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an improvement of $248 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $75 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $235 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our Adjusted EBITDA decreased $160 million over that period primarily as a result of the factors noted above.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, amortization of intangibles and certain other expenses, including non-cash expenses, (such as equity-based compensation, severance and restructuring, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments and asset impairments, including inventory) and plus or minus the impact of our LIFO inventory costing methodology.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors a helpful measure for comparing our operating performance with the performance of other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. We believe that net income is the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles that is most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA.\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, with our net loss, as derived from our consolidated financial statements (in millions):\nTable 26: <table> <tr>

Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to an equivalent GAAP measure, see pages 36-38 herein.\nSales. Our sales were $4,529 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $5,933 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $1,404 million decrease reflected a $162 million impact of the decline in foreign currencies in areas where we operate compared to the U.S. dollar.\nU.S. Segment-Our U.S. sales decreased $855 million to $3,572 million for 2015 from $4,427 million for 2014. This 19% decrease reflected a $659 million, or 36%, decrease in the upstream sector, a $167 million, or 10%, decrease in the midstream sector and a modest decline in the downstream sector. The decline in all sectors reflects the decrease in customer spending related to the decline in oil and natural gas prices and the resulting decline in rig count.\nCanadian Segment-Our Canadian sales decreased $300 million to $333 million for 2015 from $633 million for 2014. This 47% decrease reflected a $276 million, or 53%, decrease in upstream business due to a decrease in customer spending. Approximately $51 million, or 17%, of the total decline was a result of the weaker Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.\nInternational Segment-Our International sales decreased $249 million to $624 million for 2015 from $873 million for 2014. This 29% decrease reflected the combined impact of lower project activity and deferral of MRO expenditures particularly in Norway, the U.K., Australia and the Netherlands. The decrease in sales included the impact of the decline in the foreign currencies in areas where we operate compared to the U.S. dollar, which accounted for $111 million, or 45%, of the total decline.\nGross Profit. Our gross profit was $786 million (17.4% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $1,018 million (17.2% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2014. Gross profit for 2015 benefited from lower product costs reflected in our last-in first-out ( LIFO\u201d) inventory costing methodology. LIFO resulted in a reduction in cost of sales of $53 million in 2015 as compared to an increase in cost of sales of $12 million in 2014. Excluding the impact of LIFO, gross profit declined 120 basis points primarily as the result of the impact of customer pricing pressures related to the decline in oil prices and sales mix changes.\nCertain purchasing costs and warehousing activities (including receiving, inspection, and stocking costs), as well as general warehousing expenses, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses and not in cost of sales. As such, our gross profit may not be comparable to others who may include these expenses as a component of costs of goods sold. Purchasing and warehousing activities costs approximated $37 million and $46 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAdjusted Gross Profit. Adjusted Gross Profit decreased to $814 million (18.0% of sales) for 2015 from $1,120 million (18.9% of sales) for 2014, a decrease of $306 million. Adjusted Gross Profit is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted Gross Profit as sales, less cost of sales, plus depreciation and amortization, plus amortization of intangibles, and plus or minus the impact of our LIFO inventory costing methodology. We present Adjusted Gross Profit because we believe it is a useful indicator of our operating performance without regard to items, such as amortization of intangibles, that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon the nature and extent of acquisitions they have been involved in. Similarly, the impact of the LIFO inventory costing method can cause results to vary substantially from company to company depending upon whether they elect to utilize LIFO and depending upon which method they may elect. We use Adjusted Gross Profit as a key performance indicator in managing our business. We believe that gross profit is the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles that is most directly comparable to Adjusted Gross Profit.\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted Gross Profit, a non-GAAP financial measure, with our gross profit, as derived from our consolidated financial statements (in millions):\n\ufeff\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPercentage\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPercentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nof Revenue\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nof Revenue\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross profit, as reported\n</td> <td>\n$ 786\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>17.4% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 1,018\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>17.2% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>21 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>0.5% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>22 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>0.4% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmortization of intangibles\n</td> <td>60 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1.3% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>68 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1.1% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Decrease) increase in LIFO reserve\n</td> <td>(53) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(1.2%) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>12 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>0.2% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdjusted Gross Profit\n</td> <td>\n$ 814\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>18.0% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 1,120\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>18.9% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expenses. Our SG&A expenses were $606 million (13.4% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $716 million (12.1% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2014. Included within our 2015 SG&A expenses were $14 million of severance and restructuring charges resulting from cost reduction efforts as well as $5 million of incremental expense related to our MSD Engineering and Hypteck acquisitions. Included within our 2014 SG&A expenses were $8 million of severance and related costs and $6 million of charges related to the cancellation of certain executive employment agreements, $3 million of which represents the accelerated recognition of equity-based compensation expense. Excluding these amounts, SG&A decreased $115 million. Approximately $37 million of the decrease was due to the impact of weaker foreign currencies in the countries in which we operate relative to the U.S. dollar. The remaining decrease was attributable to volume-related declines and the cost reduction efforts we have made.\n\ufeff\nGoodwill and Intangibles Asset Impairment. In December 2015, because of the continued decline in commodity prices and activity levels, we performed an assessment of current market conditions and our future long-term expectations of oil and gas markets and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units were lower than their carrying values. Our assessment took into consideration, among other things, significant further reductions in projected spending by our customers in 2016 and a more pessimistic long-term outlook for the price of oil and natural gas, and the resulting impact on our 2016 budget and long-term financial forecast. As a result of this assessment, we completed an interim goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2015. This test resulted in an impairment charge of $292 million comprised of $109 million in our U.S. reporting unit and $183 million in our International reporting unit.\n\ufeff\nAs a result of these same factors, we performed impairment tests of other intangible assets as well and incurred impairment charges of $128 million related to our indefinite-lived trade name within our U.S. segment and $42 million related to the customer base intangible assets within our International segment.\nOperating (Loss) Income. Operating loss was $282 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to operating income of $302 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $584 million.\nU.S. Segment-Our U.S. segment incurred an operating loss of $47 million for 2015 as compared to operating income of $266 million for 2014. Excluding the $237 million of goodwill and intangible asset impairment, the decline of $76 million was driven by lower sales due to decreased customer spending offset by a reduction in SG&A expenses. Severance expenses negatively impacted operating income by $6 million and $7 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCanadian Segment-Operating income for our Canadian segment decreased to $9 million for 2015 from $28 million for 2014. The decrease of $19 million reflected the decline in sales offset by corresponding reductions in SG&A. Severance expenses negatively impacted operating income by $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nInternational Segment-Our International segment incurred an operating loss of $244 million for 2015 as compared to operating income of $8 million in 2014. Excluding the $225 million of goodwill and intangibles impairment charges, the $27 million decrease\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nwas a result of lower sales offset by corresponding reductions in SG&A. Severance expenses negatively impacted operating income by $7 million and $3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nInterest Expense. Our interest expense was $48 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $62 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease can be attributed to lower average debt levels in 2015. During 2015, total debt was reduced by $930 million with $355 million of net proceeds from our June 2015 Preferred Stock issuance combined with positive cash flows from operations.\nOther Income (Expense). Our other expense decreased to $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $14 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. In 2015, other expense included $5 million of expense related to our disposition of the OCTG business, a $3 million write off of debt issuance costs and foreign currency losses of $3 million as compared to a foreign currency loss of $3 million and a $1 million loss on the change of fair value derivatives in 2014. Additionally, the 2015 expenses included a $3 million charge related to a litigation matter while the 2014 expenses included a $6 million charge related to the sale of our Canadian progressive captivity pump business as well as a $4 million charge related to the loss on the disposition of our rolled and welded business.\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense). Our income tax benefit was $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to expense of $82 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our effective tax rates were 3% and 36% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These rates generally differ from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% as a result of state income taxes and differing, generally lower, foreign income tax rates. The change in the effective income tax rate between fiscal year 2015 and 2014 was primarily due to a non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge during the last quarter of 2015, tax expense during fiscal year 2015 related to provision for valuation allowances and the mix of income and losses in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate.\nNet (Loss) Income. Our net loss was $331 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to net income of $144 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $475 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $235 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $424 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our Adjusted EBITDA decreased $189 million over that period primarily as a result of the factors noted above.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, amortization of intangibles and certain other expenses, including non-cash expenses, (such as equity-based compensation, severance and restructuring, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments and asset impairments, including inventory) and plus or minus the impact of our LIFO inventory costing methodology.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors a helpful measure for comparing our operating performance with the performance of other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. We believe that net income is the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles that is most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, with our net (loss) income, as derived from our consolidated financial statements (in millions):\n\ufeff\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet (loss) income\n</td> <td>\n$ (331)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 144\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\n</td> <td>(11) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>82 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>48 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>62 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>21 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>22 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmortization of intangibles\n</td> <td>60 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>68 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Decrease) increase in LIFO reserve\n</td> <td>(53) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>12 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGoodwill and intangible asset impairment\n</td> <td>462 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEquity-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>10 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>9 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSeverance and restructuring charges\n</td> <td>14 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>8 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoss on disposition of non-core product lines\n</td> <td>5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>10 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nForeign currency losses\n</td> <td>3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWrite off of debt issuance costs\n</td> <td>3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLitigation matter\n</td> <td>3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nChange in fair value of derivative instruments\n</td> <td>1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCancellation of executive employment agreements (cash portion)\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n$ 235\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 424\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancial Condition and Cash Flows\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth our cash flows for the periods indicated below (in millions):\n\ufeff\nTable 30: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating activities\n</td> <td>\n$ 253\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 690\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ (106)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvesting activities\n</td> <td>16 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(41) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(362) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFinancing activities\n</td> <td>(226) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(599) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>467 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n$ 43\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 50\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $253 million in 2016 compared to $690 million provided by operations in 2015. The decrease in cash provided by operations was primarily the result of reduced profitability combined with a reduction in the pace of working capital contraction in response to slowing sales. Excluding cash, working capital decreased $316 million in 2016 (from 2015) as compared to a decrease of $588 million in 2015 (from 2014). The current year decline in working capital was impacted most significantly by a $141 million and $128 million reduction in inventory and accounts receivable, respectively, caused by declining sales levels. We continue to actively manage our working capital to an appropriate level given current market conditions.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $690 million in 2015 compared to $106 million used in operations in 2014. The $796 million increase in net cash provided by operations was primarily the result of reduced working capital requirements. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, working capital decreased $543 million in 2015 (from 2014) as compared to an increase of $289 million in 2014 (from 2013). The 2015 decline in working capital was impacted most significantly by a $419 million and $412 million reduction in inventory and accounts receivable, respectively, caused by declining sales levels.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $16 million in 2016, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $41 million in 2015. The $57 million increase in cash provided by investing activities is the result of $48 million in proceeds from the disposition of our U.S. OCTG product line. Our capital expenditures were $33 million and $39 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We expect capital expenditures in 2017 to be approximately $32 million.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nNet cash used in investing activities was $41 million in 2015, compared to $362 million in 2014. The $321 million decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the acquisitions of Stream AS, MSD Engineering Pte. Limited, and Hypteck AS which required cash of $344 million in 2014. Our capital expenditures were $39 million in 2015 and $20 million in 2014. The 2015 increase in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to our implementation of a new information technology system within our international segment.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $226 million in 2016, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $599 million in 2015. Net repayments on our Global ABL Facility totaled $0 million in 2016, compared to $673 million in the 2015. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we repaid $100 million of our Term Loan using available cash on hand. In 2016, we used $95 million and $24 million to fund purchases of our common stock and dividends on our preferred stock, respectively. In June 2015, we received $355 million of net proceeds related to the issuance of Series A Preferred Stock. We used these proceeds to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our Term Loan and our Global ABL Facility.\n\ufeff\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity consist of cash generated from our operating activities, existing cash balances and borrowings under our existing Global ABL Facility. At December 31, 2016, our total liquidity, including cash on hand, was $534 million. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from our operating activities is primarily dependent on our sales of products to our customers at profits sufficient to cover our fixed and variable expenses. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $109 million and $69 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, $61 million and $51 million of our cash and cash equivalents were maintained in the accounts of our various foreign subsidiaries and, if those amounts were transferred among countries or repatriated to the U.S., those amounts may be subject to additional tax liabilities, which would be recognized in our financial statements in the period during which the transfer decision was made. We currently have the intent and ability to indefinitely reinvest the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries, and there are currently no plans for the repatriation of those amounts.\nOur primary credit facilities consist of a seven-year Term Loan maturing in November 2019 with an original principal amount of $794 million and a five-year $1.05 billion Global ABL Facility that provides a $977 million facility in the United States, a $30 million facility in Norway, a $20 million facility in Canada, a $10 million facility in Australia, a $5 million facility in the United Kingdom, a $4 million facility in the Netherlands and a $4 million facility in Belgium. The Global ABL matures in July 2019. The Global ABL Facility contains an accordion feature that allows us to increase the principal amount of the facility by up to $300 million, subject to additional lender commitments. As of December 31, 2016, we had no outstanding borrowings and $425 million of Excess Availability, as defined under this Global ABL Facility. Availability is dependent on a borrowing base comprised of a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventory which is subject to redetermination from time to time. As of December 31, 2016, there was $414 million outstanding under the Term Loan, which matures on November 9, 2019.\nOur credit ratings are below investment grade\u201d and, as such, could impact both our ability to raise new funds as well as the interest rates on our future borrowings. Our existing obligations restrict our ability to incur additional debt. We were in compliance with the covenants contained in our various credit facilities as of and during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nWe believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy the anticipated cash requirements associated with our existing operations for at least the next twelve months. However, our future cash requirements could be higher than we currently expect as a result of various factors. Additionally, our ability to generate sufficient cash from our operating activities depends on our future performance, which is subject to general economic, political, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. We may from time to time seek to raise additional debt or equity financing in the public or private markets, based on market conditions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. We may also seek, from time to time, depending on market conditions, to refinance certain categories of our debt, and we may seek to consummate equity offerings. Any such transaction would be subject to market conditions, compliance with all of our credit agreements, and various other factors.\n\ufeff\nIn November 2015, the Company's board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for common stock up to $100 million, which was increased in November 2016 to $125 million. The program is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2017. The shares may be repurchased at management's discretion in the open market. Depending on market conditions and other factors, these repurchases may be commenced or suspended from time to time without prior notice. In 2016, we purchased 6,861,191 shares of common stock at a total cost of $95 million. In total under this plan, we have purchased 7,677,580 shares at a total cost of $107 million.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nContractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our minimum payment obligations as of December 31, 2016 relating to long-term debt, interest payments, capital leases, operating leases, purchase obligations and other long-term liabilities for the periods indicated (in millions):\n\ufeff\nTable 31: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nMore Than\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n2018-2019\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n2020-2021\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 414\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 8\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 406\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest payments (2)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>58 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>21 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>37 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating leases\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>185 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>40 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>55 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>36 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>54 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPurchase obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>180 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>180 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nForeign exchange forward contracts\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther long-term liabilities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>24 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>24 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 861\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 249\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 498\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 36\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 78\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\n(1) Long-term debt is based on debt outstanding at December 31, 2016.\n(2) Interest payments are based on interest rates in effect at December 31, 2016 and assume contractual amortization payments.\n(3) Purchase obligations reflect our commitments to purchase PVF products in the ordinary course of business.
