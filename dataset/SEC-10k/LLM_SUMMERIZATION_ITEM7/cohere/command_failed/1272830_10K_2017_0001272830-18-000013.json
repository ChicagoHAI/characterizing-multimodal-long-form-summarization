Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion together with Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of many factors, including the factors we describe under Item 1A - Risk Factors,\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a leading provider of cloud communications services for businesses and consumers. Our business services transform the way people work and businesses operate through a portfolio of communications solutions that enable internal collaboration among employees, while also keeping companies closely connected with their customers, across any mode of communication, on any cloud-connected device. Vonage customers can choose among or combine two separate service delivery options to suit their specific cloud communication needs. They can buy Vonage Business as a subscription and they can buy our Vonage API Platform and consume our cloud communication as a service product as programmable modules, delivered via APIs. We also provide a robust suite of feature-rich residential communication solutions.\nBusiness\nFor our Business customers, we provide innovative, cloud-based Unified Communications as a Service, or UCaaS, solutions, comprised of integrated voice, text, video, data, collaboration, and mobile applications over our flexible, scalable Session Initiation Protocol based Voice over Internet Protocol, or VoIP, network. We also offer CPaaS solutions designed to enhance the way businesses communicate with their customers by embedding communications into apps, websites and business processes. In combination, our products and services permit our business customers to communicate with their customers and employees through any cloud-connected device, in any place, at any time without the often costly investment required with on-site equipment. We have a robust set of product families tailored to serve the full range of the business value chain, from the SMB market, through mid-market and enterprise markets. We provide customers with multiple deployment options, designed to provide the reliability and quality of service they demand. We provide customers the ability to integrate our cloud communications platform with many cloud-based productivity and CRM solutions, including Google's G Suite, Zendesk, Salesforce's Sales Cloud, Oracle, and Clio. With our ability to integrate these cloud-based, workplace tools, Vonage integrates the entire business communications value chain - from employee communications that maximize productivity to the direct engagement with customers that CPaaS provides. When combined with our MPLS network, as well as voice services over customers' broadband networks via our SmartWan solution, we create a differentiated offering.\nConsumer\nFor our Consumer customers, we enable users to access and utilize our services and features, via their existing internet connections, including over 3G/4G, LTE, Cable, or DSL broadband networks. This technology enables us to offer our Consumer customers attractively priced voice and messaging services and other features around the world on a variety of devices. Our Consumer strategy is focused on the continued penetration of our core North American markets, where we will continue to provide value in international long distance and target under-served segments.\nServices outside of the United States\nWe currently have UCaaS and consumer operations in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada and believe that our low-cost Internet based communications platform enables us to cost effectively deliver voice and messaging services to other locations throughout the world. Through Nexmo, we have operations in the United States, United Kingdom, Hong Kong, and Singapore, and provide CPaaS solutions to our customers located in many countries around the world.\nTrends in Our Industry\nA number of trends in our industry have a significant effect on our results of operations and are important to an understanding of our financial statements.\n31 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2017\nCompetitive landscape. We face intense competition from traditional telephone companies, wireless companies, cable companies, and alternative communication providers. Most traditional wireline and wireless telephone service providers and cable companies are substantially larger and better capitalized than we are and have the advantage of a large existing customer base. In addition, because our competitors provide other services, they often choose to offer VoIP services or other voice services as part of a bundle that includes other products, such as video, high speed Internet access, and wireless telephone service, which we do not offer. In addition, such competitors may in the future require new customers or existing customers making changes to their service to purchase voice services when purchasing high speed Internet access. Further, as wireless providers offer more minutes at lower prices, better coverage, and companion landline alternative services, their services have become more attractive to households as a replacement for wireline service. We also compete against alternative communication providers. Some of these service providers have chosen to sacrifice telephony revenue in order to gain market share and have offered their services at low prices or for free. As we continue to introduce applications that integrate different forms of voice and messaging services over multiple devices, we are facing competition from emerging competitors focused on similar integration, as well as from alternative voice communication providers. In addition, our competitors have partnered and may in the future partner with other competitors to offer products and services, leveraging their collective competitive positions. We also are subject to the risk of future disruptive technologies. In connection with our emphasis on the international long distance market in the United States, we face competition from low-cost international calling cards and VoIP providers in addition to traditional telephone companies, cable companies, and wireless companies, each of which may implement promotional pricing targeting international long distance callers.\nRegulation. Our business has developed in a relatively lightly-regulated environment. The United States and other countries, however, are examining how VoIP services should be regulated. In particular, state telecommunications regulators continue to try to regulate VoIP service despite the FCC's 2004 Vonage Preemption Order that preempted state regulation. For example, on July 28, 2015, the Minnesota Public Utility Commission found that it has authority to regulate Charter's \u2018fixed' interconnected VoIP service. In addition to regulatory matters that directly address VoIP, a number of other regulatory initiatives could impact our business. One such regulatory initiative is net neutrality. On February 26, 2015, the FCC adopted strong net neutrality rules. On December 14, 2017 the FCC voted to reverse its 2015 neutrality rules. The FCC's recent reversal of its stance on net neutrality may have a negative long term impact on businesses such as ours who rely on the Internet to create and deliver products and services. Challenges to the FCC's ruling are underway, with public interest groups, states, local municipalities and companies seeking redress in the courts and/or through legislation. See also the discussion under \"Regulation\" in Note 11 to our financial statements for a discussion of regulatory issues that impact us.\nKey Operating Data\nThe table below includes key operating data that our management uses to measure the growth and operating performance of the Business segment:\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>498,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>376,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>219,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average monthly revenues per seat (2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43.86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44.94\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42.79\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Seats (at period end) (2)\n</td> <td>727,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>638,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>541,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue churn (2)\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes revenues of $139,665 and $58,148 from CPaaS for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.\n(2) UCaaS only.\nRevenues. Business revenues includes revenues from our business customers from primarily from acquired entities.\nAverage monthly revenues per seat. Average monthly revenues per seat for a particular period is calculated by dividing our revenues for that period by the simple average number of seats for the period, and dividing the result by the number of months in the period. The simple average number of seats for the period is the number of seats on the first day of the period, plus the number of seats on the last day of the period, divided by two. Our average monthly revenues per seat decreased from $44.94 for 2016 to $43.86 for 2017 in part due to the loss of cloud service revenues for some of the Company's UCaaS customers as a result of the sale of our Hosted Infrastructure product line in May 2017 along with the Company's plan to sell access more selectively during the current year period.\nSeats. Seats include, as of a particular date, all paid seats from which a customer can make an outbound telephone call on that date and virtual seats. Seats exclude electronic fax lines and toll free numbers, which do not allow outbound telephone calls by customers. Seats increased from 638,096 as of December 31, 2016 to 727,085 as of December 31, 2017. This increase is due to continued growth in our Business customers as we have increased marketing investment to attract these more profitable customers.\n32 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2017\nRevenue churn. Revenue churn is calculated by dividing the monthly recurring revenue from customers or customer locations that have terminated during a period by the simple average of the total monthly recurring revenue from all customers in a given period. The simple average of total monthly recurring revenue from all customers during the period is the total monthly recurring revenue on the first day of the period, plus the total monthly recurring revenue on the last day of the period, divided by two. Terminations, as used in the calculation of churn statistics, do not include customers terminated during the period if termination occurred within the first month after activation. Other companies may calculate revenue churn differently, and their revenue churn data may not be directly comparable to ours. Revenue churn decreased from 1.4% for the year ended 2016 to 1.3% for the year ended 2017. Our revenue churn will fluctuate over time due to economic conditions, loss of customers who are acquired, and competitive pressures including promotional pricing. We are continuing to invest in our overall quality of service which includes customer care headcount and systems, billing systems, on-boarding processes and self-service options to ensure we scale our processes to our growth and continue to improve the overall customer experience.\nThe table below includes key operating data that our management uses to measure the growth and operating performance of the Consumer segment:\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>503,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>579,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>676,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average monthly revenues per subscriber line\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27.58\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscriber lines (at period end)\n</td> <td>1,492,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,711,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,940,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer churn\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues. Consumer revenues represents revenue from our consumer customers including revenues from our legacy business customers using Vonage VoIP products.\nAverage monthly revenues per subscriber line. Average monthly revenues per subscriber line for a particular period is calculated by dividing our revenues for that period by the simple average number of subscriber lines for the period, and dividing the result by the number of months in the period. The simple average number of subscriber lines for the period is the number of subscriber lines on the first day of the period, plus the number of subscriber lines on the last day of the period, divided by two. Our average monthly revenues per subscriber line decreased from $26.43 for 2016 to $26.19 for 2017 due primarily to lower international long distance pay-per-use revenue.\nSubscriber lines. Our subscriber lines include, as of a particular date, all paid subscriber lines from which a customer can make an outbound telephone call on that date. Our subscriber lines include fax lines, including fax lines bundled with subscriber lines in our small office home office calling plans and soft phones, but do not include our virtual phone numbers and toll free numbers, which only allow inbound telephone calls to customers. Subscriber lines decreased from 1,711,366 as of December 31, 2016 to 1,492,067 as of December 31, 2017, reflecting planned actions to enhance the profitability of the assisted sales channel by eliminating lower performing locations and restructuring the pricing offers, and to shift investment to our business market.\nCustomer churn. Customer churn is calculated by dividing the number of customers that have terminated during a period by the simple average of number of customers in a given period. The simple average number of customers during the period is the number of customers on the first day of the period, plus the number of customers on the last day of the period, divided by two. Terminations, as used in the calculation of churn statistics, do not include customers terminated during the period if termination occurred within the first month after activation. Other companies may calculate customer churn differently, and their customer churn data may not be directly comparable to ours. Customer churn decreased to 2.0% for 2017 from 2.2% for 2016. The decrease was due primarily to our decision to maximize customer value by focusing marketing spend on higher return channels and away from assisted selling channels which had higher early life churn. We monitor customer churn on a daily basis and use it as an indicator of the level of customer satisfaction. Customers who have been with us for a year or more tend to have a lower churn rate than customers who have not. In addition, our customers who are international callers generally churn at a lower rate than customers who are domestic callers. Our customer churn will fluctuate over time due to economic conditions, competitive pressures including promotional pricing targeting international long distance callers, marketplace perception of our services, and our ability to provide high quality customer care and network quality and add future innovative products and services. Customer churn differs from our previously reported average monthly customer churn in that our business customers are no longer included in this metric. See the discussion below for detail regarding churn impacting our business customers.\n33 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2017\nREVENUES\nRevenues consist of services revenue and customer equipment and shipping revenue. Substantially all of our revenues are services revenue. For consumer customers in the United States, we offer domestic and international rate plans, including a variety of residential plans and mobile plans. Through our acquisitions we offer SMB, mid-market, and enterprise customers several service plans with different pricing structures and contractual requirements ranging in duration from month-to-month to three years. In addition, we provide managed equipment to business customers for which the customers pay a monthly fee. Customers also have the opportunity to purchase premium features for additional fees. In addition, through our acquisition of Nexmo we derive revenue from usage-based fees earned from customers using our cloud-based software products. These usage-based software products include our messaging, voice, Verify and chat APIs. Usage-based fees include number of text messages sent or received using our messaging APIs, minutes of call duration activity for our voice APIs, and number of converted authentications for our Verify API. Services revenue is offset by the cost of certain customer acquisition activities, such as rebates and promotions. In addition, in certain instances, we charge disconnect fees which are recognized as revenue at the time the disconnect fees are collected from our customer.\nIn the United States, we charge regulatory, compliance, E-911, and intellectual property-related recovery fees on a monthly basis to defray costs, and to cover taxes that we are charged by the suppliers of telecommunications services. In addition, we recognize revenue on a gross basis for contributions to the Federal Universal Service Fund, or USF, and related fees. All other taxes are recorded on a net basis.\nCustomer equipment and shipping revenue consists of revenue from sales of customer equipment to our wholesalers or directly to customers and retailers. In addition, customer equipment and shipping revenues include revenues from the sale of VoIP telephones in order to access our small and medium business services. Customer equipment and shipping revenue also includes the fees, when collected, that we charge our customers for shipping any equipment to them.\nOPERATING EXPENSE\nOperating expenses consist of cost of service, cost of goods sold, sales and marketing expense, engineering and development expense, general and administrative expense, and depreciation and amortization.\n34 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT

Other income (expense), net increased by $1,599, or 462% in 2017 compared to 2016 due the sale of the Hosted Infrastructure product line during the second quarter of 2017 as further discussed in Note 12, Acquisitions and Dispositions.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\nInterest expense. The increase in interest expense of $4,256, or 48%, was due mainly to increased borrowings under the credit agreement, or the 2016 Credit Facility, entered into by the Company in June 2016 in order to finance the acquisition of Nexmo.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change 2016 to 2017\n</td> <td>% Change 2016 to 2017\n</td> <td>$ Change 2015 to 2016\n</td> <td>% Change 2015 to 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(79,726\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17,694\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(18,418\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(62,032\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(351\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>174\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>57\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized tax expense of $79,726 which primarily reflects the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, which was signed into law by the President of the United States on December 22, 2017. The TCJA most notably reduces the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% along with eliminating the alternative minimum tax, or AMT, and imposes a mandatory one-time tax on foreign earnings. Based upon currently available information, the Company estimates that the enactment of the legislation will result in a charge to income tax expense of $69,378 which is primarily associated with the re-measurement of the Company's deferred tax balances at the 21% income tax rate.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company's tax expense reflects a discrete period tax expense of $1,220 which was recorded related to expired stock options which was partially offset by $389, $661 and $77 which was recorded in the second quarter of 2016, the third quarter of 2016, and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. In addition, certain acquisition related expenses incurred in the second quarter of 2016 are treated as a permanent difference as the expenses are not deductible for tax purposes but are a reduction of pre-tax income. In the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2016, the reduction in the value of our contingent consideration in connection with the acquisition of Nexmo was treated as a permanent difference resulting in a decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016. In the first quarter of 2015 a discrete period tax benefit of $1,058 was recorded in discontinued operations related to the write-off of intercompany loans associated with the wind down of our joint venture in Brazil.\nDiscontinued Operations Attributable to Vonage\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company had a loss from discontinued operations of $2,380 as a result of the Company exiting the Brazilian market.\n39 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2017\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nFor the three years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 we generated income from operations. We expect to continue to balance efforts to grow our revenue while consistently achieving operating profitability. To grow our revenue, we continue to make investments in growth initiatives, marketing, application development, network quality and expansion, and customer care. Although we believe we will achieve consistent profitability in the future, we ultimately may not be successful and we may not achieve consistent profitability. We believe that cash flow from operations and cash on hand will fund our operations for at least the next twelve months.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change 2016 to 2017\n</td> <td>$ Change 2015 to 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>128,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>134,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(41,029\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(30,737\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(191,449\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(153,509\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>160,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(37,940\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>(96,242\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>68,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(164,296\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate on changes on cash\n</td> <td>1,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(316\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>871\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities increased to $128,058 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $93,456 for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase in operating income adjusted for non-cash items of $27,817 driven by a decrease in operating expenses as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily attributable to decreased sales and marketing costs. Also attributing to the increase in operating activities was a decrease in cash used for working capital requirements of $6,785 during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to a decrease in timing of prepayments made during the current year.\nCash provided by operating activities decreased to $93,456 for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $134,485 for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to an increase in cash used for working capital requirements of $34,209 due to increased payments for acquisition and integration related costs along with increased payments related to interest on the Company's outstanding financing arrangements.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $30,737, which is a decrease from cash used in investing activities of $191,449 during the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily attributable to payments of $163,042 made during the prior year to acquire Nexmo slightly offset by a decrease in cash provided from the maturity and sale of marketable securities of $14,389.\nCash used in investing activities increased to $191,449 for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $153,509 during the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily driven by an increase in payments made for the acquisition of businesses of $46,298 related the acquisition of Nexmo in 2016 as compared to payments made during 2015 for the acquisitions of Simple Signal and iCore. This was offset by an increase in cash provided by the sale and maturity of available for sale securities of $7,768 during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used by financing activities was $96,242 for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to cash provided by financing activities of $68,054 during the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable increased payments for financing arrangements net of new borrowings of $195,188 slightly offset by fewer repurchases of common stock of $23,360 during the current year.\nCash provided by financing activities increased to $68,054 for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $35,451 for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to increased proceeds from financing arrangements net or repayments of $53,938 in connection with the 2016 Credit Facility offset by an increase in payments made to repurchase common stock of $16,991.\n40 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2017\nSources of Liquidity\nThe principal sources of liquidity are derived from available borrowings under our existing financing arrangements, existing cash on hand, and cash flows from operations. As described in Note 7, Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit Facility, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company's financing arrangements consist of the 2016 Credit Facility comprised of a $125,000 term note and a $325,000 revolving credit facility.\nUses of Liquidity\nAcquisition of Businesses\nNexmo was acquired on June 3, 2016. Nexmo shareholders are receiving consideration of $231,122. Of the consideration, $194,684 (net of cash acquired of $16,094) was paid at close, consisting of $163,093 of cash (net of $16,094 of cash acquired) and 6,823 in shares of Vonage common stock valued at $31,591. The remaining $36,438 of the $231,122 purchase price is in the form of restricted cash, restricted stock and options held by Nexmo management and employees, subject to vesting requirements over time. We financed the transaction with $179,000 from our 2016 Credit Facility.\niCore was acquired on August 31, 2015 for $92,000 cash consideration, increased by $689 of working capital excess as of the closing date, resulting in a total acquisition cost of $92,689. We financed the transaction with $10,689 of cash on hand and $82,000 from our 2015 revolving credit facility.\nSimple Signal was acquired on April 1, 2015 for $25,578. We financed the transaction by borrowing $20,000 from our 2014 revolving credit facility.\nCapital expenditures\nFor 2017, capital expenditures were primarily for the implementation of software solutions and purchase of network equipment as we continue to expand our network. Our capital expenditures for the year ended 2017 were $33,289, of which $11,374 was for software acquisition and development. The majority of these expenditures are comprised of investments in information technology and systems infrastructure, including an electronic data warehouse, online customer service, and customer management platforms. For 2018, we believe our capital and software expenditures will be approximately $35,000.\nAvailable Borrowings Under the 2016 Credit Facility\nWe maintain significant availability under our lines of credit to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. As of December 31, 2017, amounts available under the 2016 Credit Facility totaled $184 million.\nState and Local Sales Taxes\nWe also have contingent liabilities for state and local sales taxes. As of December 31, 2017, we had a reserve of $1,147. If our ultimate liability exceeds this amount, it could affect our liquidity unfavorably. However, we currently do not believe that these contingent liabilities will significantly impair our liquidity.\n41 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2017\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS\nThe table below summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2017, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods.\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less\nthan\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2-3\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 5\nyears\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(unaudited)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016 term note\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016 revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>141,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest related to 2016 term note\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest related to 2016 revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,698\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>369,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,947\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>263,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Commercial Commitments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standby letters of credit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,562\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,562\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations and other commercial commitments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>371,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>263,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCredit Facility. On June 3, 2016, we entered the 2016 Credit Facility consisting of a $125,000 term note and a $325,000 revolving credit facility. See Note 7, Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit Facility in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCapital lease obligations. At December 31, 2017, we had current capital lease obligations of $140 mainly related to leasing of office equipment.\nOperating lease obligations. At December 31, 2017, we had future commitments for operating leases for co-location facilities mainly in the United States that accommodate a portion of our network equipment, for office spaces leased in Holmdel, New Jersey for our headquarters, as well as various other locations for field sales and administration offices, in Tel Aviv, Israel for application development, and in London United Kingdom for our UK office.\nPurchase obligations. The purchase obligations are primarily commitments to vendors who will provide local inbound services, provide customer care services, provide efax service, provide carrier operation, provide data center with technical supports, provide networks and telephone related services, provide marketing infrastructure and services, provide customer caller ID, provide electricity to our office, license patents to us, partner with us in international operations, process LNP orders, and lease office space to us. In certain cases, we may terminate these arrangements early upon payment of specified fees. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which we are contractually committed. We also purchase products and services as needed with no firm commitment. For this reason, the amounts presented do not provide a reliable indicator of our expected future cash outflows or changes in our expected cash position. See also Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined critical accounting policies as those policies management believes are most important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operation and which require the Company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, the Company has identified the following critical accounting policies and estimated addressed below. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 and Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following describes our critical accounting policies and estimates:\nUse of Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\n42 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2017\nWe base our estimates on historical experience, available market information, appropriate valuation methodologies, and on various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Estimates are used for such items as depreciable lives for long-lived assets including intangible assets, tax provisions, uncollectible accounts, and assets and liabilities assumed in business combinations, among others. In addition, estimates are used to test long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment.\nRevenue Recognition\nOperating revenues consist of services revenues and sales of equipment to customers. The point in time at which revenues are recognized is determined in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition, and Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 605, Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exist; delivery has occurred; the selling prices is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.\nServices Revenue\nSubstantially all of our revenues are services revenues, which are derived from monthly subscription fees, usage based billion, and, in Vonage Enterprise, we offer domestic and international rate plans, including a variety of residential plans and mobile plans. For business customers, we offer SMB, mid-market, and enterprise customers several service plans with different pricing structures and contractual requirements ranging in duration from month-to-month to three years. As a result of multiple billing cycles each month, we estimate the amount of revenues earned from customers but not billed from the end of each billing cycle to the end of each reporting period and record these amounts as accounts receivable. These estimates are based primarily upon historical evidence and have been consistent with our actual results.\nIn the United States, we charge regulatory, compliance, E-911, and intellectual property-related fees on a monthly basis to defray costs, and to cover taxes that we are charged by the suppliers of telecommunications services. These charges, along with the remittance to the relevant government entity, are recorded on a net basis. In addition, we collect Federal Universal Service Fund, or USF, fees from customers to recover our obligation to contribute to the fund, as allowed by the FCC. We recognize USF revenues on a gross basis and record the related fees in cost of sales.\nThrough Nexmo, we provide CPaaS solutions to our customers through innovative communication APIs for text messaging and voice communications, allowing developers and enterprises to embed contextual communications into mobile apps, websites and business workflows via text, social media, chat apps and voice. Nexmo has two types of revenue activities:\n\u2022Retail - Revenue is primarily derived from supplying messaging (SMS and Voice) services to customers. Nexmo customers are typically billed in advance of use of our service. Revenue is recognized in the period when messages are sent by the customer.\n\u2022Trading - We refer to transactions with service providers or bulk SMS aggregators customers as \"trading\" activity. We sell services to these customers who then onsell to their customers, delivering voice or SMS messages. Since the aggregator is our customer, revenue is recognized on a gross basis with related costs included in cost of sales.\nCustomer Equipment and Shipping Revenue\nRevenue is generated from sales of customer equipment to wholesalers or directly to customers for replacement devices, or for upgrading their device at the time of customer sign-up for which we charge an additional fee. In addition, customer equipment and shipping revenues include revenues from the sale of VoIP telephones in order to access our small and medium business services. Customer equipment and shipping revenues also include the fees that customers are charged for shipping their customer equipment to them. Customer equipment and shipping revenues include sales to our wholeslaers, who subsequently resell this customer equipment to customers. Revenues are reduced for payments to retailers and rebates to customers to the extent of customer equipment and shipping revenues.\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Refer to Item 15, Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information on the adoption of ASU 2014-09.\nValuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had goodwill of $373,764 consisting of $149,328 associated with the acquisition of Nexmo, which comprises the CPaaS reporting unit, and $224,436 associated with the acquisitions of iCore, Simple Signal, Telesphere and gUnify, which collectively comprise the UCaaS reporting unit. The Company does not have any goodwill allocated to its Consumer segment as of December 31, 2017. In addition, the Company recognized intangible assets measured primarily based upon significant inputs that are not observable in the market and represent Level 3 measurements as defined by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements. Intangible assets acquired in the settlement of litigation or by direct purchase are accounted for based upon the fair value of assets received.\n43 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2017\nThe Company applies ASC 805, Business Combinations and ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other to account for goodwill and intangible assets. The Company amortizes all finite-lived intangible assets over their respective estimated useful lives while goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized. Goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment on an annual basis on October 1st and, when specific circumstances dictate, between annual tests. The Company tests for goodwill at the reporting unit level, which is identified by assessing whether the components of the Company's operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available. With respect to the annual goodwill impairment test, the Company identified the UCaaS and CPaaS reporting units which collectively represent the Business segment. The goodwill impairment test involves evaluating qualitative information to determine if it is more than 50% likely that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If such a determination is made or if the Company chooses not to utilize a qualitative approach, then the traditional two-step goodwill impairment test described below is applied. The first step, identifying a potential impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step would need to be conducted; otherwise, no further steps are necessary as no potential impairment exists. The second step, measuring the impairment loss, compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. Any excess of the reporting unit goodwill carrying value over the respective implied fair value is recognized as an impairment loss. There was no impairment of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Company performed step one of the two-step impairment test for its UCaaS and CPaaS reporting units as of October 1, 2017 utilizing the income approach. Under the income approach, the Company estimated that the fair value of the reporting units' invested capital exceeded its carrying value and, as such, the Company concluded that goodwill associated with the reporting units in the following table is not impaired:\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reporting Unit (Segment)\n</td> <td>% Fair Value Over Carrying Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>UCaaS (Business)\n</td> <td>392\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CPaaS (Business)\n</td> <td>295\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe perform a review of purchased-intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than we had originally estimated or that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances exist, we assess the recoverability of purchased-intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairments, if any, are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. If the useful life of the asset is shorter than originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of amortization and amortize the remaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life. There was no impairment of purchased-intangible assets identified for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, or 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities at enacted income tax rates for the temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Any effects of changes in income tax rates or tax laws are included in the provision for income taxes in the period of enactment. Our net deferred tax assets primarily consist of net operating loss carry forwards, or NOLs,. We are required to record a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets if we conclude that it is more likely than not that taxable income generated in the future will be insufficient to utilize the future income tax benefit from our net deferred tax assets (namely, the NOLs) prior to expiration. We periodically review this conclusion, which requires significant management judgment. If we are able to conclude in a future period that a future income tax benefit from our net deferred tax assets has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized, we are required in that period to reduce the related valuation allowance with a corresponding decrease in income tax expense. This would result in a non-cash benefit to our net income in the period of the determination. In subsequent periods, we would expect to recognize income tax expense equal to our pre-tax income multiplied by our effective income tax rate, an expense that was not recognized prior to the reduction of the valuation allowance.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had NOLs for United States federal and state tax purposes, including those NOLs acquired as part of past business combinations, of $556,368 and $146,254, respectively, expiring at various times from years ending through 2037. In addition, we had NOLs for United Kingdom tax purposes of $50,142 with no expiration date.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, if we undergo an ownership change\u201d which is generally defined as a greater than 50% change by value in our equity ownership over a three-year period, our ability to use our pre-change of control NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes against our post-change income may be limited. The Section 382 limitation is applied annually so as to limit the use of our pre-change NOLs to an amount that generally equals the value of our stock immediately before the ownership change multiplied by a designated federal long-term tax-exempt rate. At December 31, 2017, there were no limitations on the use of our NOLs except for the NOLs of Vocalocity as of the date of acquisition for which the Company has reflected in the deferred tax asset.\n44 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2017\nCapitalized Software\nCapitalized costs include external consulting fees, payroll related cost for employees who are directly associated with, and who devote time to, the Company's internal-use software projects. Capitalization begins when the planning stage is complete, and continues during the application development stage. Capitalization ceases when the software has been tested and is ready for its intended use. Internal and external costs incurred during the preliminary project stage, post implementation operation stage and ongoing maintenance are expensed as incurred. The Company amortizes completed internal-use software that is used on its network to expense over its estimated useful life.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2, Summary of Significant

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion together with Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of many factors, including the factors we describe under Item 1A - Risk Factors,\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a leading provider of cloud communications services for businesses and consumers. Our business services transform the way people work and businesses operate through a portfolio of communications solutions that enable internal collaboration among employees, while also keeping companies closely connected with their customers, across any mode of communication, on any cloud-connected device. Vonage customers can choose among or combine two separate service delivery options to suit their specific cloud communication needs. They can buy Vonage Business as a subscription and they can buy our Vonage API Platform and consume our cloud communication as a service product as programmable modules, delivered via APIs. We also provide a robust suite of feature-rich residential communication solutions.\nBusiness\nFor our Business customers, we provide innovative, cloud-based Unified Communications as a Service, or UCaaS, solutions, comprised of integrated voice, text, video, data, collaboration, and mobile applications over our flexible, scalable Session Initiation Protocol based Voice over Internet Protocol, or VoIP, network. We also offer CPaaS solutions designed to enhance the way businesses communicate with their customers by embedding communications into apps, websites and business processes. In combination, our products and services permit our business customers to communicate with their customers and employees through any cloud-connected device, in any place, at any time without the often costly investment required with on-site equipment. We have a robust set of product families tailored to serve the full range of the business value chain, from the SMB market, through mid-market and enterprise markets. We provide customers with multiple deployment options, designed to provide the reliability and quality of service they demand. We provide customers the ability to integrate our cloud communications platform with many cloud-based productivity and CRM solutions, including Google's G Suite, Zendesk, Salesforce's Sales Cloud, Oracle, and Clio.

When combined with our MPLS network, as well as voice services over customers' broadband networks via our SmartWan solution, we create a differentiated offering.\nConsumer\nFor our Consumer customers, we enable users to access and utilize our services and features, via their existing internet connections, including over 3G/4G, LTE, Cable, or DSL broadband networks. This technology enables us to offer our Consumer customers attractively priced voice and messaging services and other features around the world on a variety of devices. Our Consumer strategy is focused on the continued penetration of our core North American markets, where we will continue to provide value in international long distance and target under-served segments.\nServices outside of the United States\nWe currently have UCaaS and consumer operations in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada and believe that our low-cost Internet based communications platform enables us to cost effectively deliver voice and messaging services to other locations throughout the world. Through Nexmo, we have operations in the United States, United Kingdom, Hong Kong, and Singapore, and provide CPaaS solutions to our customers located in many countries around the world.\nTrends in Our Industry\nA number of trends in our industry have a significant effect on our results of operations and are important to an understanding of our financial statements.\n31 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2017\nCompetitive landscape. We face intense competition from traditional telephone companies, wireless companies, cable companies, and alternative communication providers. Most traditional wireline and wireless telephone service providers and cable companies are substantially larger and better capitalized than we are and have the advantage of a large existing customer base. In addition, because our competitors provide other services, they often choose to offer VoIP services or other voice services as part of a bundle that includes other products, such as video, high speed Internet access, and wireless telephone service, which we do not offer. In addition, such competitors may in the future require new customers or existing customers making changes to their service to purchase voice services when purchasing high speed Internet access. Further, as wireless providers offer more minutes at lower prices, better coverage, and companion landline alternative services, their services have become more attractive to households as a replacement for wireline service. We also compete against alternative communication providers. Some of these service providers have chosen to sacrifice telephony revenue in order to gain market share and have offered their services at low prices or for free. As we continue to introduce applications that integrate different forms of voice and messaging services over multiple devices, we are facing competition from emerging competitors focused on similar integration, as well as from alternative voice communication providers. In addition, our competitors have partnered and may in the future partner with other competitors to offer products and services, leveraging their collective competitive positions. We also are subject to the risk of future disruptive technologies. In connection with our emphasis on the international long distance market in the United States, we face competition from low-cost international calling cards and VoIP providers in addition to traditional telephone companies, cable companies, and wireless companies, each of which may implement promotional pricing targeting international long distance callers.\nRegulation. Our business has developed in a relatively lightly-regulated environment. The United States and other countries, however, are examining how VoIP services should be regulated. In particular, state telecommunications regulators continue to try to regulate VoIP service despite the FCC's 2004 Vonage Preemption Order that preempted state regulation. For example, on July 28, 2015, the Minnesota Public Utility Commission found that it has authority to regulate Charter's \u2018fixed' interconnected VoIP service. In addition to regulatory matters that directly address VoIP, a number of other regulatory initiatives could impact our business. One such regulatory initiative is net neutrality. On February 26, 2015, the FCC adopted strong net neutrality rules. On December 14, 2017 the FCC voted to reverse its 2015 neutrality rules. The FCC's recent reversal of its stance on net neutrality may have a negative long term impact on businesses such as ours who rely on the Internet to create and deliver products and services. Challenges to the FCC's ruling are underway, with public interest groups, states, local municipalities and companies seeking redress in the courts and/or through legislation. See also the discussion under \"Regulation\" in Note 11 to our financial statements for a discussion of regulatory issues that impact us.\nKey Operating Data\nThe table below includes key operating data that our management uses to measure the growth and operating performance of the Business segment:\n\n(1) Includes revenues of $139,665 and $58,148 from CPaaS for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.\n(2) UCaaS only.\nRevenues. Business revenues includes revenues from our business customers from primarily from acquired entities.\nAverage monthly revenues per seat. Average monthly revenues per seat for a particular period is calculated by dividing our revenues for that period by the simple average number of seats for the period, and dividing the result by the number of months in the period. The simple average number of seats for the period is the number of seats on the first day of the period, plus the number of seats on the last day of the period, divided by two. Our average monthly revenues per seat decreased from $44.94 for 2016 to $43.86 for 2017 in part due to the loss of cloud service revenues for some of the Company's UCaaS customers as a result of the sale of our Hosted Infrastructure product line in May 2017 along with the Company's plan to sell access more selectively during the current year period.\nSeats. Seats include, as of a particular date, all paid seats from which a customer can make an outbound telephone call on that date and virtual seats. Seats exclude electronic fax lines and toll free numbers, which do not allow outbound telephone calls by customers. Seats increased from 638,096 as of December 31, 2016 to 727,085 as of December 31, 2017. This increase is due to continued growth in our Business customers as we have increased marketing investment to attract these more profitable customers.\n32 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2017\nRevenue churn. Revenue churn is calculated by dividing the monthly recurring revenue from customers or customer locations that have terminated during a period by the simple average of the total monthly recurring revenue from all customers in a given period. The simple average of total monthly recurring revenue from all customers during the period is the total monthly recurring revenue on the first day of the period, plus the total monthly recurring revenue on the last day of the period, divided by two. Terminations, as used in the calculation of churn statistics, do not include customers terminated during the period if termination occurred within the first month after activation. Other companies may calculate revenue churn differently, and their revenue churn data may not be directly comparable to ours. Revenue churn decreased from 1.4% for the year ended 2016 to 1.3% for the year ended 2017. Our revenue churn will fluctuate over time due to economic conditions, loss of customers who are acquired, and competitive pressures including promotional pricing. We are continuing to invest in our overall quality of service which includes customer care headcount and systems, billing systems, on-boarding processes and self-service options to ensure we scale our processes to our growth and continue to improve the overall customer experience.\nThe table below includes key operating data that our management uses to measure the growth and operating performance of the Consumer segment:\n\nRevenues. Consumer revenues represents revenue from our consumer customers including revenues from our legacy business customers using Vonage VoIP products.\nAverage monthly revenues per subscriber line. Average monthly revenues per subscriber line for a particular period is calculated by dividing our revenues for that period by the simple average number of subscriber lines for the period, and dividing the result by the number of months in the period. The simple average number of subscriber lines for the period is the number of subscriber lines on the first day of the period, plus the number of subscriber lines on the last day of the period, divided by two. Our average monthly revenues per subscriber line decreased from $26.43 for 2016 to $26.19 for 2017 due primarily to lower international long distance pay-per-use revenue.\nSubscriber lines. Our subscriber lines include, as of a particular date, all paid subscriber lines from which a customer can make an outbound telephone call on that date. Our subscriber lines include fax lines, including fax lines bundled with subscriber lines in our small office home office calling plans and soft phones, but do not include our virtual phone numbers and toll free numbers, which only allow inbound telephone calls to customers. Subscriber lines decreased from 1,711,366 as of December 31, 2016 to 1,492,067 as of December 31, 2017, reflecting planned actions to enhance the profitability of the assisted sales channel by eliminating lower performing locations and restructuring the pricing offers, and to shift investment to our business market.\nCustomer churn. Customer churn is calculated by dividing the number of customers that have terminated during a period by the simple average of number of customers in a given period. The simple average number of customers during the period is the number of customers on the first day of the period, plus the number of customers on the last day of the period, divided by two. Terminations, as used in the calculation of churn statistics, do not include customers terminated during the period if termination occurred within the first month after activation. Other companies may calculate customer churn differently, and their customer churn data may not be directly comparable to ours. Customer churn decreased to 2.0% for 2017 from 2.2% for 2016. The decrease was due primarily to our decision to maximize customer value by focusing marketing spend on higher return channels and away from assisted selling channels which had higher early life churn. We monitor customer churn on a daily basis and use it as an indicator of the level of customer satisfaction. Customers who have been with us for a year or more tend to have a lower churn rate than customers who have not. In addition, our customers who are international callers generally churn at a lower rate than customers who are domestic callers. Our customer churn will fluctuate over time due to economic conditions, competitive pressures including promotional pricing targeting international long distance callers, marketplace perception of our services, and our ability to provide high quality customer care and network quality and add future innovative products and services. Customer churn differs from our previously reported average monthly customer churn in that our business customers are no longer included in this metric. See the discussion below for detail regarding churn impacting our business customers.\n33 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2017\nREVENUES\nRevenues consist of services revenue and customer equipment and shipping revenue. Substantially all of our revenues are services revenue. For consumer customers in the United States, we offer domestic and international rate plans, including a variety of residential plans and mobile plans. Through our acquisitions we offer SMB, mid-market, and enterprise customers several service plans with different pricing structures and contractual requirements ranging in duration from month-to-month to three years. In addition, we provide managed equipment to business customers for which the customers pay a monthly fee. Customers also have the opportunity to purchase premium features for additional fees. In addition, through our acquisition of Nexmo we derive revenue from usage-based fees earned from customers using our cloud-based software products. These usage-based software products include our messaging, voice, Verify and chat APIs. Usage-based fees include number of text messages sent or received using our messaging APIs, minutes of call duration activity for our voice APIs, and number of converted authentications for our Verify API. Services revenue is offset by the cost of certain customer acquisition activities, such as rebates and promotions. In addition, in certain instances, we charge disconnect fees which are recognized as revenue at the time the disconnect fees are collected from our customer.\nIn the United States, we charge regulatory, compliance, E-911, and intellectual property-related recovery fees on a monthly basis to defray costs, and to cover taxes that we are charged by the suppliers of telecommunications services. In addition, we recognize revenue on a gross basis for contributions to the Federal Universal Service Fund, or USF, and related fees. All other taxes are recorded on a net basis.\nCustomer equipment and shipping revenue consists of revenue from sales of customer equipment to our wholesalers or directly to customers and retailers. In addition, customer equipment and shipping revenues include revenues from the sale of VoIP telephones in order to access our small and medium business services. Customer equipment and shipping revenue also includes the fees, when collected, that we charge our customers for shipping any equipment to them.\nOPERATING EXPENSE\nOperating expenses consist of cost of service, cost of goods sold, sales and marketing expense, engineering and development expense, general and administrative expense, and depreciation and amortization.\n34 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2017\nRESULTS OF OPERATION\nThe following table sets forth, as a percentage of consolidated operating revenues, our consolidated statement of income for the periods indicated:\n\nManagement's discussion of the results of operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015\nWe calculate gross margin in order to evaluate operating revenues as total revenues less cost of service, which primarily consists of fees that we pay to third parties on an ongoing basis in order to provide our services, and cost of goods sold which primarily includes costs incurred when a customer first subscribes to our service.\nThe following table presents the composition of gross margin for the years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015:\n\n(1) Excludes depreciation and amortization of $27,308, $28,489, and $24,868, respectively.\n35 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2017\nBusiness Segment Gross Margin for the Years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015\n\n(1) Includes customer premise equipment, access, professional services, and shipping and handling.\n(2) Excludes depreciation and amortization of $20,100, $18,820, and $15,819, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nThe following table describes the increase in business gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016:\n\n36 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2017\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\nThe following table describes the increase in business gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015:\n\nConsumer Gross Margin for the Years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015\n\n(1) Includes customer premise equipment, professional services, and shipping and handling.\n(2) Excludes depreciation and amortization of $7,208, $9,669, and $9,049, respectively.\n37 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2017\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nThe following table describes the decrease in consumer gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016:\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\nThe following table describes the decrease in consumer gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015:\n\nOperating Expenses\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nTotal other operating expenses decreased by $18,376 during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to the following:\n \u2022 Sales and marketing expense decreased by $17,718, or (5)%, due to a continued shift during 2017 in traditional marketing investments targeting Consumer customers to more selective targeted advertising focused on attracting more profitable Business customers resulting in overall fewer media marketing programs being deployed during the current year. \n \u2022 General and administrative expense decreased by $767, or (1)%, primarily due to a decrease in consulting and legal fees associated with the acquisition of Nexmo during the previous year. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\nTotal other operating expenses increased $10,215 during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the following:\n \u2022 Sales and marketing expense decreased by $16,927, or 5%, due to a shift in traditional media marketing investments from Consumer to Business customers as part of an effort to attract these more profitable customers. \n \u2022 Engineering and development expense increased by $2,539, or 9%, due to incremental investment in new business products and services, the acquisition of Nexmo in 2016 and the acquisition of iCore and Simple Signal in 2015. \n \u2022 General and administrative expense increased by $14,151, or 13%, primarily due to the addition of Simple Signal, iCore and Nexmo, offset by the reduction of Nexmo contingent consideration of $11,472. \n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization increased $10,452, or 17%, primarily due to the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles from the acquisition of Simple Signal in April 2015, iCore in August 2015, and Nexmo in June 2016. \n38 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2017\nOther Income (Expense)\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nInterest expense. The increase in interest expense of $1,826, or 14%, was due mainly to higher interest rates in 2017 compared to 2016, offset by lower principal balances, and the additional interest expense associated with our interest rate swaps arrangement.\nOther income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net increased by $1,599, or 462% in 2017 compared to 2016 due the sale of the Hosted Infrastructure product line during the second quarter of 2017 as further discussed in Note 12, Acquisitions and Dispositions.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\nInterest expense. The increase in interest expense of $4,256, or 48%, was due mainly to increased borrowings under the credit agreement, or the 2016 Credit Facility, entered into by the Company in June 2016 in order to finance the acquisition of Nexmo.\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized tax expense of $79,726 which primarily reflects the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, which was signed into law by the President of the United States on December 22, 2017. The TCJA most notably reduces the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% along with eliminating the alternative minimum tax, or AMT, and imposes a mandatory one-time tax on foreign earnings. Based upon currently available information, the Company estimates that the enactment of the legislation will result in a charge to income tax expense of $69,378 which is primarily associated with the re-measurement of the Company's deferred tax balances at the 21% income tax rate.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company's tax expense reflects a discrete period tax expense of $1,220 which was recorded related to expired stock options which was partially offset by $389, $661 and $77 which was recorded in the second quarter of 2016, the third quarter of 2016, and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. In addition, certain acquisition related expenses incurred in the second quarter of 2016 are treated as a permanent difference as the expenses are not deductible for tax purposes but are a reduction of pre-tax income. In the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2016, the reduction in the value of our contingent consideration in connection with the acquisition of Nexmo was treated as a permanent difference resulting in a decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016. In the first quarter of 2015 a discrete period tax benefit of $1,058 was recorded in discontinued operations related to the write-off of intercompany loans associated with the wind down of our joint venture in Brazil.\nDiscontinued Operations Attributable to Vonage\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company had a loss from discontinued operations of $2,380 as a result of the Company exiting the Brazilian market.\n39 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2017\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nFor the three years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 we generated income from operations. We expect to continue to balance efforts to grow our revenue while consistently achieving operating profitability. To grow our revenue, we continue to make investments in growth initiatives, marketing, application development, network quality and expansion, and customer care. Although we believe we will achieve consistent profitability in the future, we ultimately may not be successful and we may not achieve consistent profitability. We believe that cash flow from operations and cash on hand will fund our operations for at least the next twelve months.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated:\n\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities increased to $128,058 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $93,456 for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase in operating income adjusted for non-cash items of $27,817 driven by a decrease in operating expenses as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily attributable to decreased sales and marketing costs. Also attributing to the increase in operating activities was a decrease in cash used for working capital requirements of $6,785 during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to a decrease in timing of prepayments made during the current year.\nCash provided by operating activities decreased to $93,456 for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $134,485 for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to an increase in cash used for working capital requirements of $34,209 due to increased payments for acquisition and integration related costs along with increased payments related to interest on the Company's outstanding financing arrangements.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $30,737, which is a decrease from cash used in investing activities of $191,449 during the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily attributable to payments of $163,042 made during the prior year to acquire Nexmo slightly offset by a decrease in cash provided from the maturity and sale of marketable securities of $14,389.\nCash used in investing activities increased to $191,449 for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $153,509 during the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily driven by an increase in payments made for the acquisition of businesses of $46,298 related the acquisition of Nexmo in 2016 as compared to payments made during 2015 for the acquisitions of Simple Signal and iCore. This was offset by an increase in cash provided by the sale and maturity of available for sale securities of $7,768 during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used by financing activities was $96,242 for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to cash provided by financing activities of $68,054 during the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable increased payments for financing arrangements net of new borrowings of $195,188 slightly offset by fewer repurchases of common stock of $23,360 during the current year.\nCash provided by financing activities increased to $68,054 for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $35,451 for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to increased proceeds from financing arrangements net or repayments of $53,938 in connection with the 2016 Credit Facility offset by an increase in payments made to repurchase common stock of $16,991.\n40 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2017\nSources of Liquidity\nThe principal sources of liquidity are derived from available borrowings under our existing financing arrangements, existing cash on hand, and cash flows from operations. As described in Note 7, Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit Facility, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company's financing arrangements consist of the 2016 Credit Facility comprised of a $125,000 term note and a $325,000 revolving credit facility.\nUses of Liquidity\nAcquisition of Businesses\nNexmo was acquired on June 3, 2016. Nexmo shareholders are receiving consideration of $231,122. Of the consideration, $194,684 (net of cash acquired of $16,094) was paid at close, consisting of $163,093 of cash (net of $16,094 of cash acquired) and 6,823 in shares of Vonage common stock valued at $31,591. The remaining $36,438 of the $231,122 purchase price is in the form of restricted cash, restricted stock and options held by Nexmo management and employees, subject to vesting requirements over time. We financed the transaction with $179,000 from our 2016 Credit Facility.\niCore was acquired on August 31, 2015 for $92,000 cash consideration, increased by $689 of working capital excess as of the closing date, resulting in a total acquisition cost of $92,689. We financed the transaction with $10,689 of cash on hand and $82,000 from our 2015 revolving credit facility.\nSimple Signal was acquired on April 1, 2015 for $25,578. We financed the transaction by borrowing $20,000 from our 2014 revolving credit facility.\nCapital expenditures\nFor 2017, capital expenditures were primarily for the implementation of software solutions and purchase of network equipment as we continue to expand our network. Our capital expenditures for the year ended 2017 were $33,289, of which $11,374 was for software acquisition and development. The majority of these expenditures are comprised of investments in information technology and systems infrastructure, including an electronic data warehouse, online customer service, and customer management platforms. For 2018, we believe our capital and software expenditures will be approximately $35,000.\nAvailable Borrowings Under the 2016 Credit Facility\nWe maintain significant availability under our lines of credit to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. As of December 31, 2017, amounts available under the 2016 Credit Facility totaled $184 million.\nState and Local Sales Taxes\nWe also have contingent liabilities for state and local sales taxes. As of December 31, 2017, we had a reserve of $1,147. If our ultimate liability exceeds this amount, it could affect our liquidity unfavorably. However, we currently do not believe that these contingent liabilities will significantly impair our liquidity.\n41 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2017\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS\nThe table below summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2017, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods.\n\nCredit Facility. On June 3, 2016, we entered the 2016 Credit Facility consisting of a $125,000 term note and a $325,000 revolving credit facility. See Note 7, Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit Facility in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCapital lease obligations. At December 31, 2017, we had current capital lease obligations of $140 mainly related to leasing of office equipment.\nOperating lease obligations. At December 31, 2017, we had future commitments for operating leases for co-location facilities mainly in the United States that accommodate a portion of our network equipment, for office spaces leased in Holmdel, New Jersey for our headquarters, as well as various other locations for field sales and administration offices, in Tel Aviv, Israel for application development, and in London United Kingdom for our UK office.\nPurchase obligations. The purchase obligations are primarily commitments to vendors who will provide local inbound services, provide customer care services, provide efax service, provide carrier operation, provide data center with technical supports, provide networks and telephone related services, provide marketing infrastructure and services, provide customer caller ID, provide electricity to our office, license patents to us, partner with us in international operations, process LNP orders, and lease office space to us. In certain cases, we may terminate these arrangements early upon payment of specified fees. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which we are contractually committed. We also purchase products and services as needed with no firm commitment. For this reason, the amounts presented do not provide a reliable indicator of our expected future cash outflows or changes in our expected cash position. See also Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined critical accounting policies as those policies management believes are most important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operation and which require the Company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, the Company has identified the following critical accounting policies and estimated addressed below. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 and Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following describes our critical accounting policies and estimates:\nUse of Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\n42 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2017\nWe base our estimates on historical experience, available market information, appropriate valuation methodologies, and on various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Estimates are used for such items as depreciable lives for long-lived assets including intangible assets, tax provisions, uncollectible accounts, and assets and liabilities assumed in business combinations, among others. In addition, estimates are used to test long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment.\nRevenue Recognition\nOperating revenues consist of services revenues and sales of equipment to customers. The point in time at which revenues are recognized is determined in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition, and Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 605, Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exist; delivery has occurred; the selling prices is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.\nServices Revenue\nSubstantially all of our revenues are services revenues, which are derived from monthly subscription fees, usage based billion, and, in Vonage Enterprise, we offer domestic and international rate plans, including a variety of residential plans and mobile plans. For business customers, we offer SMB, mid-market, and enterprise customers several service plans with different pricing structures and contractual requirements ranging in duration from month-to-month to three years. As a result of multiple billing cycles each month, we estimate the amount of revenues earned from customers but not billed from the end of each billing cycle to the end of each reporting period and record these amounts as accounts receivable. These estimates are based primarily upon historical evidence and have been consistent with our actual results.\nIn the United States, we charge regulatory, compliance, E-911, and intellectual property-related fees on a monthly basis to defray costs, and to cover taxes that we are charged by the suppliers of telecommunications services. These charges, along with the remittance to the relevant government entity, are recorded on a net basis. In addition, we collect Federal Universal Service Fund, or USF, fees from customers to recover our obligation to contribute to the fund, as allowed by the FCC. We recognize USF revenues on a gross basis and record the related fees in cost of sales.\nThrough Nexmo, we provide CPaaS solutions to our customers through innovative communication APIs for text messaging and voice communications, allowing developers and enterprises to embed contextual communications into mobile apps, websites and business workflows via text, social media, chat apps and voice. Nexmo has two types of revenue activities:\n\u2022Retail - Revenue is primarily derived from supplying messaging (SMS and Voice) services to customers. Nexmo customers are typically billed in advance of use of our service. Revenue is recognized in the period when messages are sent by the customer.\n\u2022Trading - We refer to transactions with service providers or bulk SMS aggregators customers as \"trading\" activity. We sell services to these customers who then onsell to their customers, delivering voice or SMS messages. Since the aggregator is our customer, revenue is recognized on a gross basis with related costs included in cost of sales.\nCustomer Equipment and Shipping Revenue\nRevenue is generated from sales of customer equipment to wholesalers or directly to customers for replacement devices, or for upgrading their device at the time of customer sign-up for which we charge an additional fee. In addition, customer equipment and shipping revenues include revenues from the sale of VoIP telephones in order to access our small and medium business services. Customer equipment and shipping revenues also include the fees that customers are charged for shipping their customer equipment to them. Customer equipment and shipping revenues include sales to our wholeslaers, who subsequently resell this customer equipment to customers. Revenues are reduced for payments to retailers and rebates to customers to the extent of customer equipment and shipping revenues.\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Refer to Item 15, Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information on the adoption of ASU 2014-09.\nValuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had goodwill of $373,764 consisting of $149,328 associated with the acquisition of Nexmo, which comprises the CPaaS reporting unit, and $224,436 associated with the acquisitions of iCore, Simple Signal, Telesphere and gUnify, which collectively comprise the UCaaS reporting unit. The Company does not have any goodwill allocated to its Consumer segment as of December 31, 2017. In addition, the Company recognized intangible assets measured primarily based upon significant inputs that are not observable in the market and represent Level 3 measurements as defined by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements. Intangible assets acquired in the settlement of litigation or by direct purchase are accounted for based upon the fair value of assets received.\n43 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2017\nThe Company applies ASC 805, Business Combinations and ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other to account for goodwill and intangible assets. The Company amortizes all finite-lived intangible assets over their respective estimated useful lives while goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized. Goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment on an annual basis on October 1st and, when specific circumstances dictate, between annual tests. The Company tests for goodwill at the reporting unit level, which is identified by assessing whether the components of the Company's operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available. With respect to the annual goodwill impairment test, the Company identified the UCaaS and CPaaS reporting units which collectively represent the Business segment. The goodwill impairment test involves evaluating qualitative information to determine if it is more than 50% likely that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If such a determination is made or if the Company chooses not to utilize a qualitative approach, then the traditional two-step goodwill impairment test described below is applied. The first step, identifying a potential impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step would need to be conducted; otherwise, no further steps are necessary as no potential impairment exists. The second step, measuring the impairment loss, compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. Any excess of the reporting unit goodwill carrying value over the respective implied fair value is recognized as an impairment loss. There was no impairment of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Company performed step one of the two-step impairment test for its UCaaS and CPaaS reporting units as of October 1, 2017 utilizing the income approach. Under the income approach, the Company estimated that the fair value of the reporting units' invested capital exceeded its carrying value and, as such, the Company concluded that goodwill associated with the reporting units in the following table is not impaired:\n\nWe perform a review of purchased-intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than we had originally estimated or that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances exist, we assess the recoverability of purchased-intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairments, if any, are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. If the useful life of the asset is shorter than originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of amortization and amortize the remaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life. There was no impairment of purchased-intangible assets identified for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, or 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities at enacted income tax rates for the temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Any effects of changes in income tax rates or tax laws are included in the provision for income taxes in the period of enactment. Our net deferred tax assets primarily consist of net operating loss carry forwards, or NOLs,. We are required to record a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets if we conclude that it is more likely than not that taxable income generated in the future will be insufficient to utilize the future income tax benefit from our net deferred tax assets (namely, the NOLs) prior to expiration. We periodically review this conclusion, which requires significant management judgment. If we are able to conclude in a future period that a future income tax benefit from our net deferred tax assets has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized, we are required in that period to reduce the related valuation allowance with a corresponding decrease in income tax expense. This would result in a non-cash benefit to our net income in the period of the determination. In subsequent periods, we would expect to recognize income tax expense equal to our pre-tax income multiplied by our effective income tax rate, an expense that was not recognized prior to the reduction of the valuation allowance.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had NOLs for United States federal and state tax purposes, including those NOLs acquired as part of past business combinations, of $556,368 and $146,254, respectively, expiring at various times from years ending through 2037. In addition, we had NOLs for United Kingdom tax purposes of $50,142 with no expiration date.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, if we undergo an ownership change\u201d which is generally defined as a greater than 50% change by value in our equity ownership over a three-year period, our ability to use our pre-change of control NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes against our post-change income may be limited. The Section 382 limitation is applied annually so as to limit the use of our pre-change NOLs to an amount that generally equals the value of our stock immediately before the ownership change multiplied by a designated federal long-term tax-exempt rate. At December 31, 2017, there were no limitations on the use of our NOLs except for the NOLs of Vocalocity as of the date of acquisition for which the Company has reflected in the deferred tax asset.\n44 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2017\nCapitalized Software\nCapitalized costs include external consulting fees, payroll related cost for employees who are directly associated with, and who devote time to, the Company's internal-use software projects. Capitalization begins when the planning stage is complete, and continues during the application", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion together with Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of many factors, including the factors we describe under Item 1A - Risk Factors,\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a leading provider of cloud communications services for businesses and consumers. Our business services transform the way people work and businesses operate through a portfolio of communications solutions that enable internal collaboration among employees, while also keeping companies closely connected with their customers, across any mode of communication, on any cloud-connected device. Vonage customers can choose among or combine two separate service delivery options to suit their specific cloud communication needs. They can buy Vonage Business as a subscription and they can buy our Vonage API Platform and consume our cloud communication as a service product as programmable modules, delivered via APIs. We also provide a robust suite of feature-rich residential communication solutions.\nBusiness\nFor our Business customers, we provide innovative, cloud-based Unified Communications as a Service, or UCaaS, solutions, comprised of integrated voice, text, video, data, collaboration, and mobile applications over our flexible, scalable Session Initiation Protocol based Voice over Internet Protocol, or VoIP, network. We also offer CPaaS solutions designed to enhance the way businesses communicate with their customers by embedding communications into apps, websites and business processes. In combination, our products and services permit our business customers to communicate with their customers and employees through any cloud-connected device, in any place, at any time without the often costly investment required with on-site equipment. We have a robust set of product families tailored to serve the full range of the business value chain, from the SMB market, through mid-market and enterprise markets. We provide customers with multiple deployment options, designed to provide the reliability and quality of service they demand. We provide customers the ability to integrate our cloud communications platform with many cloud-based productivity and CRM solutions, including Google's G Suite, Zendesk, Salesforce's Sales Cloud, Oracle, and Clio. With our ability to integrate these cloud-based, workplace tools, Vonage integrates the entire business communications value chain - from employee communications that maximize productivity to the direct engagement with customers that CPaaS provides. When combined with our MPLS network, as well as voice services over customers' broadband networks via our SmartWan solution, we create a differentiated offering.\nConsumer\nFor our Consumer customers, we enable users to access and utilize our services and features, via their existing internet connections, including over 3G/4G, LTE, Cable, or DSL broadband networks. This technology enables us to offer our Consumer customers attractively priced voice and messaging services and other features around the world on a variety of devices. Our Consumer strategy is focused on the continued penetration of our core North American markets, where we will continue to provide value in international long distance and target under-served segments.\nServices outside of the United States\nWe currently have UCaaS and consumer operations in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada and believe that our low-cost Internet based communications platform enables us to cost effectively deliver voice and messaging services to other locations throughout the world. Through Nexmo, we have operations in the United States, United Kingdom, Hong Kong, and Singapore, and provide CPaaS solutions to our customers located in many countries around the world.\nTrends in Our Industry\nA number of trends in our industry have a significant effect on our results of operations and are important to an understanding of our financial statements.\n31 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2017\nCompetitive landscape. We face intense competition from traditional telephone companies, wireless companies, cable companies, and alternative communication providers. Most traditional wireline and wireless telephone service providers and cable companies are substantially larger and better capitalized than we are and have the advantage of a large existing customer base. In addition, because our competitors provide other services, they often choose to offer VoIP services or other voice services as part of a bundle that includes other products, such as video, high speed Internet access, and wireless telephone service, which we do not offer. In addition, such competitors may in the future require new customers or existing customers making changes to their service to purchase voice services when purchasing high speed Internet access. Further, as wireless providers offer more minutes at lower prices, better coverage, and companion landline alternative services, their services have become more attractive to households as a replacement for wireline service. We also compete against alternative communication providers. Some of these service providers have chosen to sacrifice telephony revenue in order to gain market share and have offered their services at low prices or for free. As we continue to introduce applications that integrate different forms of voice and messaging services over multiple devices, we are facing competition from emerging competitors focused on similar integration, as well as from alternative voice communication providers. In addition, our competitors have partnered and may in the future partner with other competitors to offer products and services, leveraging their collective competitive positions. We also are subject to the risk of future disruptive technologies. In connection with our emphasis on the international long distance market in the United States, we face competition from low-cost international calling cards and VoIP providers in addition to traditional telephone companies, cable companies, and wireless companies, each of which may implement promotional pricing targeting international long distance callers.\nRegulation. Our business has developed in a relatively lightly-regulated environment. The United States and other countries, however, are examining how VoIP services should be regulated. In particular, state telecommunications regulators continue to try to regulate VoIP service despite the FCC's 2004 Vonage Preemption Order that preempted state regulation. For example, on July 28, 2015, the Minnesota Public Utility Commission found that it has authority to regulate Charter's \u2018fixed' interconnected VoIP service. In addition to regulatory matters that directly address VoIP, a number of other regulatory initiatives could impact our business. One such regulatory initiative is net neutrality. On February 26, 2015, the FCC adopted strong net neutrality rules. On December 14, 2017 the FCC voted to reverse its 2015 neutrality rules. The FCC's recent reversal of its stance on net neutrality may have a negative long term impact on businesses such as ours who rely on the Internet to create and deliver products and services. Challenges to the FCC's ruling are underway, with public interest groups, states, local municipalities and companies seeking redress in the courts and/or through legislation. See also the discussion under \"Regulation\" in Note 11 to our financial statements for a discussion of regulatory issues that impact us.\nKey Operating Data\nThe table below includes key operating data that our management uses to measure the growth and operating performance of the Business segment:\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>498,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>376,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>219,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average monthly revenues per seat (2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43.86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44.94\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42.79\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Seats (at period end) (2)\n</td> <td>727,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>638,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>541,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue churn (2)\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes revenues of $139,665 and $58,148 from CPaaS for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.\n(2) UCaaS only.\nRevenues. Business revenues includes revenues from our business customers from primarily from acquired entities.\nAverage monthly revenues per seat. Average monthly revenues per seat for a particular period is calculated by dividing our revenues for that period by the simple average number of seats for the period, and dividing the result by the number of months in the period. The simple average number of seats for the period is the number of seats on the first day of the period, plus the number of seats on the last day of the period, divided by two. Our average monthly revenues per seat decreased from $44.94 for 2016 to $43.86 for 2017 in part due to the loss of cloud service revenues for some of the Company's UCaaS customers as a result of the sale of our Hosted Infrastructure product line in May 2017 along with the Company's plan to sell access more selectively during the current year period.\nSeats. Seats include, as of a particular date, all paid seats from which a customer can make an outbound telephone call on that date and virtual seats. Seats exclude electronic fax lines and toll free numbers, which do not allow outbound telephone calls by customers. Seats increased from 638,096 as of December 31, 2016 to 727,085 as of December 31, 2017. This increase is due to continued growth in our Business customers as we have increased marketing investment to attract these more profitable customers.\n32 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2017\nRevenue churn. Revenue churn is calculated by dividing the monthly recurring revenue from customers or customer locations that have terminated during a period by the simple average of the total monthly recurring revenue from all customers in a given period. The simple average of total monthly recurring revenue from all customers during the period is the total monthly recurring revenue on the first day of the period, plus the total monthly recurring revenue on the last day of the period, divided by two. Terminations, as used in the calculation of churn statistics, do not include customers terminated during the period if termination occurred within the first month after activation. Other companies may calculate revenue churn differently, and their revenue churn data may not be directly comparable to ours. Revenue churn decreased from 1.4% for the year ended 2016 to 1.3% for the year ended 2017. Our revenue churn will fluctuate over time due to economic conditions, loss of customers who are acquired, and competitive pressures including promotional pricing. We are continuing to invest in our overall quality of service which includes customer care headcount and systems, billing systems, on-boarding processes and self-service options to ensure we scale our processes to our growth and continue to improve the overall customer experience.\nThe table below includes key operating data that our management uses to measure the growth and operating performance of the Consumer segment:\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>503,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>579,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>676,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average monthly revenues per subscriber line\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27.58\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscriber lines (at period end)\n</td> <td>1,492,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,711,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,940,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer churn\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues. Consumer revenues represents revenue from our consumer customers including revenues from our legacy business customers using Vonage VoIP products.\nAverage monthly revenues per subscriber line. Average monthly revenues per subscriber line for a particular period is calculated by dividing our revenues for that period by the simple average number of subscriber lines for the period, and dividing the result by the number of months in the period. The simple average number of subscriber lines for the period is the number of subscriber lines on the first day of the period, plus the number of subscriber lines on the last day of the period, divided by two. Our average monthly revenues per subscriber line decreased from $26.43 for 2016 to $26.19 for 2017 due primarily to lower international long distance pay-per-use revenue.\nSubscriber lines. Our subscriber lines include, as of a particular date, all paid subscriber lines from which a customer can make an outbound telephone call on that date. Our subscriber lines include fax lines, including fax lines bundled with subscriber lines in our small office home office calling plans and soft phones, but do not include our virtual phone numbers and toll free numbers, which only allow inbound telephone calls to customers. Subscriber lines decreased from 1,711,366 as of December 31, 2016 to 1,492,067 as of December 31, 2017, reflecting planned actions to enhance the profitability of the assisted sales channel by eliminating lower performing locations and restructuring the pricing offers, and to shift investment to our business market.\nCustomer churn. Customer churn is calculated by dividing the number of customers that have terminated during a period by the simple average of number of customers in a given period. The simple average number of customers during the period is the number of customers on the first day of the period, plus the number of customers on the last day of the period, divided by two. Terminations, as used in the calculation of churn statistics, do not include customers terminated during the period if termination occurred within the first month after activation. Other companies may calculate customer churn differently, and their customer churn data may not be directly comparable to ours. Customer churn decreased to 2.0% for 2017 from 2.2% for 2016. The decrease was due primarily to our decision to maximize customer value by focusing marketing spend on higher return channels and away from assisted selling channels which had higher early life churn. We monitor customer churn on a daily basis and use it as an indicator of the level of customer satisfaction. Customers who have been with us for a year or more tend to have a lower churn rate than customers who have not. In addition, our customers who are international callers generally churn at a lower rate than customers who are domestic callers. Our customer churn will fluctuate over time due to economic conditions, competitive pressures including promotional pricing targeting international long distance callers, marketplace perception of our services, and our ability to provide high quality customer care and network quality and add future innovative products and services. Customer churn differs from our previously reported average monthly customer churn in that our business customers are no longer included in this metric. See the discussion below for detail regarding churn impacting our business customers.\n33 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2017\nREVENUES\nRevenues consist of services revenue and customer equipment and shipping revenue. Substantially all of our revenues are services revenue. For consumer customers in the United States, we offer domestic and international rate plans, including a variety of residential plans and mobile plans. Through our acquisitions we offer SMB, mid-market, and enterprise customers several service plans with different pricing structures and contractual requirements ranging in duration from month-to-month to three years. In addition, we provide managed equipment to business customers for which the customers pay a monthly fee. Customers also have the opportunity to purchase premium features for additional fees. In addition, through our acquisition of Nexmo we derive revenue from usage-based fees earned from customers using our cloud-based software products. These usage-based software products include our messaging, voice, Verify and chat APIs. Usage-based fees include number of text messages sent or received using our messaging APIs, minutes of call duration activity for our voice APIs, and number of converted authentications for our Verify API. Services revenue is offset by the cost of certain customer acquisition activities, such as rebates and promotions. In addition, in certain instances, we charge disconnect fees which are recognized as revenue at the time the disconnect fees are collected from our customer.\nIn the United States, we charge regulatory, compliance, E-911, and intellectual property-related recovery fees on a monthly basis to defray costs, and to cover taxes that we are charged by the suppliers of telecommunications services. In addition, we recognize revenue on a gross basis for contributions to the Federal Universal Service Fund, or USF, and related fees. All other taxes are recorded on a net basis.\nCustomer equipment and shipping revenue consists of revenue from sales of customer equipment to our wholesalers or directly to customers and retailers. In addition, customer equipment and shipping revenues include revenues from the sale of VoIP telephones in order to access our small and medium business services. Customer equipment and shipping revenue also includes the fees, when collected, that we charge our customers for shipping any equipment to them.\nOPERATING EXPENSE\nOperating expenses consist of cost of service, cost of goods sold, sales and marketing expense, engineering and development expense, general and administrative expense, and depreciation and amortization.\n34 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT

2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to the following:\n \u2022 Sales and marketing expense decreased by $17,718, or (5)%, due to a continued shift during 2017 in traditional marketing investments targeting Consumer customers to more selective targeted advertising focused on attracting more profitable Business customers resulting in overall fewer media marketing programs being deployed during the current year. \n \u2022 General and administrative expense decreased by $767, or (1)%, primarily due to a decrease in consulting and legal fees associated with the acquisition of Nexmo during the previous year. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\nTotal other operating expenses increased $10,215 during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the following:\n \u2022 Sales and marketing expense decreased by $16,927, or 5%, due to a shift in traditional media marketing investments from Consumer to Business customers as part of an effort to attract these more profitable customers. \n \u2022 Engineering and development expense increased by $2,539, or 9%, due to incremental investment in new business products and services, the acquisition of Nexmo in 2016 and the acquisition of iCore and Simple Signal in 2015. \n \u2022 General and administrative expense increased by $14,151, or 13%, primarily due to the addition of Simple Signal, iCore and Nexmo, offset by the reduction of Nexmo contingent consideration of $11,472. \n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization increased $10,452, or 17%, primarily due to the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles from the acquisition of Simple Signal in April 2015, iCore in August 2015, and Nexmo in

Other income (expense), net increased by $1,599, or 462% in 2017 compared to 2016 due the sale of the Hosted Infrastructure product line during the second quarter of 2017 as further discussed in Note 12, Acquisitions and Dispositions.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\nInterest expense. The increase in interest expense of $4,256, or 48%, was due mainly to increased borrowings under the credit agreement, or the 2016 Credit Facility, entered into by the Company in June 2016 in order to finance the acquisition of Nexmo.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change 2016 to 2017\n</td> <td>% Change 2016 to 2017\n</td> <td>$ Change 2015 to 2016\n</td> <td>% Change 2015 to 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(79,726\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17,694\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(18,418\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(62,032\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(351\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>174\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>57\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized tax expense of $79,726 which primarily reflects the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, which was signed into law by the President of the United States on December 22, 2017. The TCJA most notably reduces the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% along with eliminating the alternative minimum tax, or AMT, and imposes a mandatory one-time tax on foreign earnings. Based upon currently available information, the Company estimates that the enactment of the legislation will result in a charge to income tax expense of $69,378 which is primarily associated with the re-measurement of the Company's deferred tax balances at the 21% income tax rate.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company's tax expense reflects a discrete period tax expense of $1,220 which was recorded related to expired stock options which was partially offset by $389, $661 and $77 which was recorded in the second quarter of 2016, the third quarter of 2016, and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. In addition, certain acquisition related expenses incurred in the second quarter of 2016 are treated as a permanent difference as the expenses are not deductible for tax purposes but are a reduction of pre-tax income. In the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2016, the reduction in the value of our contingent consideration in connection with the acquisition of Nexmo was treated as a permanent difference resulting in a decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016. In the first quarter of 2015 a discrete period tax benefit of $1,058 was recorded in discontinued operations related to the write-off of intercompany loans associated with the wind down of our joint venture in Brazil.\nDiscontinued Operations Attributable to Vonage\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company had a loss from discontinued operations of $2,380 as a result of the Company exiting the Brazilian market.\n39 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2017\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nFor the three years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 we generated income from operations. We expect to continue to balance efforts to grow our revenue while consistently achieving operating profitability. To grow our revenue, we continue to make investments in growth initiatives, marketing, application development, network quality and expansion, and customer care. Although we believe we will achieve consistent profitability in the future, we ultimately may not be successful and we may not achieve consistent profitability. We believe that cash flow from operations and cash on hand will fund our operations for at least the next twelve months.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change 2016 to 2017\n</td> <td>$ Change 2015 to 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>128,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>134,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(41,029\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(30,737\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(191,449\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(153,509\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>160,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(37,940\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>(96,242\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>68,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(164,296\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate on changes on cash\n</td> <td>1,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(316\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>871\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities increased to $128,058 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $93,456 for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase in operating income adjusted for non-cash items of $27,817 driven by a decrease in operating expenses as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily attributable to decreased sales and marketing costs. Also attributing to the increase in operating activities was a decrease in cash used for working capital requirements of $6,785 during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to a decrease in timing of prepayments made during the current year.\nCash provided by operating activities decreased to $93,456 for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $134,485 for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to an increase in cash used for working capital requirements of $34,209 due to increased payments for acquisition and integration related costs along with increased payments related to interest on the Company's outstanding financing arrangements.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $30,737, which is a decrease from cash used in investing activities of $191,449 during the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily attributable to payments of $163,042 made during the prior year to acquire Nexmo slightly offset by a decrease in cash provided from the maturity and sale of marketable securities of $14,389.\nCash used in investing activities increased to $191,449 for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $153,509 during the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily driven by an increase in payments made for the acquisition of businesses of $46,298 related the acquisition of Nexmo in 2016 as compared to payments made during 2015 for the acquisitions of Simple Signal and iCore. This was offset by an increase in cash provided by the sale and maturity of available for sale securities of $7,768 during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used by financing activities was $96,242 for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to cash provided by financing activities of $68,054 during the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable increased payments for financing arrangements net of new borrowings of $195,188 slightly offset by fewer repurchases of common stock of $23,360 during the current year.\nCash provided by financing activities increased to $68,054 for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $35,451 for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to increased proceeds from financing arrangements net or repayments of $53,938 in connection with the 2016 Credit Facility offset by an increase in payments made to repurchase common stock of $16,991.\n40 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2017\nSources of Liquidity\nThe principal sources of liquidity are derived from available borrowings under our existing financing arrangements, existing cash on hand, and cash flows from operations. As described in Note 7, Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit Facility, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company's financing arrangements consist of the 2016 Credit Facility comprised of a $125,000 term note and a $325,000 revolving credit facility.\nUses of Liquidity\nAcquisition of Businesses\nNexmo was acquired on June 3, 2016. Nexmo shareholders are receiving consideration of $231,122. Of the consideration, $194,684 (net of cash acquired of $16,094) was paid at close, consisting of $163,093 of cash (net of $16,094 of cash acquired) and 6,823 in shares of Vonage common stock valued at $31,591. The remaining $36,438 of the $231,122 purchase price is in the form of restricted cash, restricted stock and options held by Nexmo management and employees, subject to vesting requirements over time. We financed the transaction with $179,000 from our 2016 Credit Facility.\niCore was acquired on August 31, 2015 for $92,000 cash consideration, increased by $689 of working capital excess as of the closing date, resulting in a total acquisition cost of $92,689. We financed the transaction with $10,689 of cash on hand and $82,000 from our 2015 revolving credit facility.\nSimple Signal was acquired on April 1, 2015 for $25,578. We financed the transaction by borrowing $20,000 from our 2014 revolving credit facility.\nCapital expenditures\nFor 2017, capital expenditures were primarily for the implementation of software solutions and purchase of network equipment as we continue to expand our network. Our capital expenditures for the year ended 2017 were $33,289, of which $11,374 was for software acquisition and development. The majority of these expenditures are comprised of investments in information technology and systems infrastructure, including an electronic data warehouse, online customer service, and customer management platforms. For 2018, we believe our capital and software expenditures will be approximately $35,000.\nAvailable Borrowings Under the 2016 Credit Facility\nWe maintain significant availability under our lines of credit to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. As of December 31, 2017, amounts available under the 2016 Credit Facility totaled $184 million.\nState and Local Sales Taxes\nWe also have contingent liabilities for state and local sales taxes. As of December 31, 2017, we had a reserve of $1,147. If our ultimate liability exceeds this amount, it could affect our liquidity unfavorably. However, we currently do not believe that these contingent liabilities will significantly impair our liquidity.\n41 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2017\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS\nThe table below summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2017, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods.\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less\nthan\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2-3\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 5\nyears\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(unaudited)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016 term note\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016 revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>141,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest related to 2016 term note\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest related to 2016 revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,698\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>369,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,947\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>263,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Commercial Commitments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standby letters of credit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,562\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,562\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations and other commercial commitments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>371,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>263,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCredit Facility. On June 3, 2016, we entered the 2016 Credit Facility consisting of a $125,000 term note and a $325,000 revolving credit facility. See Note 7, Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit Facility in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCapital lease obligations. At December 31, 2017, we had current capital lease obligations of $140 mainly related to leasing of office equipment.\nOperating lease obligations. At December 31, 2017, we had future commitments for operating leases for co-location facilities mainly in the United States that accommodate a portion of our network equipment, for office spaces leased in Holmdel, New Jersey for our headquarters, as well as various other locations for field sales and administration offices, in Tel Aviv, Israel for application development, and in London United Kingdom for our UK office.\nPurchase obligations. The purchase obligations are primarily commitments to vendors who will provide local inbound services, provide customer care services, provide efax service, provide carrier operation, provide data center with technical supports, provide networks and telephone related services, provide marketing infrastructure and services, provide customer caller ID, provide electricity to our office, license patents to us, partner with us in international operations, process LNP orders, and lease office space to us. In certain cases, we may terminate these arrangements early upon payment of specified fees. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which we are contractually committed. We also purchase products and services as needed with no firm commitment. For this reason, the amounts presented do not provide a reliable indicator of our expected future cash outflows or changes in our expected cash position. See also Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined critical accounting policies as those policies management believes are most important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operation and which require the Company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, the Company has identified the following critical accounting policies and estimated addressed below. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 and Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following describes our critical accounting policies and estimates:\nUse of Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\n42 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2017\nWe base our estimates on historical experience, available market information, appropriate valuation methodologies, and on various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Estimates are used for such items as depreciable lives for long-lived assets including intangible assets, tax provisions, uncollectible accounts, and assets and liabilities assumed in business combinations, among others. In addition, estimates are used to test long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment.\nRevenue Recognition\nOperating revenues consist of services revenues and sales of equipment to customers. The point in time at which revenues are recognized is determined in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition, and Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 605, Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exist; delivery has occurred; the selling prices is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.\nServices Revenue\nSubstantially all of our revenues are services revenues, which are derived from monthly subscription fees, usage based billion, and, in Vonage Enterprise, we offer domestic and international rate plans, including a variety of residential plans and mobile plans. For business customers, we offer SMB, mid-market, and enterprise customers several service plans with different pricing structures and contractual requirements ranging in duration from month-to-month to three years. As a result of multiple billing cycles each month, we estimate the amount of revenues earned from customers but not billed from the end of each billing cycle to the end of each reporting period and record these amounts as accounts receivable. These estimates are based primarily upon historical evidence and have been consistent with our actual results.\nIn the United States, we charge regulatory, compliance, E-911, and intellectual property-related fees on a monthly basis to defray costs, and to cover taxes that we are charged by the suppliers of telecommunications services. These charges, along with the remittance to the relevant government entity, are recorded on a net basis. In addition, we collect Federal Universal Service Fund, or USF, fees from customers to recover our obligation to contribute to the fund, as allowed by the FCC. We recognize USF revenues on a gross basis and record the related fees in cost of sales.\nThrough Nexmo, we provide CPaaS solutions to our customers through innovative communication APIs for text messaging and voice communications, allowing developers and enterprises to embed contextual communications into mobile apps, websites and business workflows via text, social media, chat apps and voice. Nexmo has two types of revenue activities:\n\u2022Retail - Revenue is primarily derived from supplying messaging (SMS and Voice) services to customers. Nexmo customers are typically billed in advance of use of our service. Revenue is recognized in the period when messages are sent by the customer.\n\u2022Trading - We refer to transactions with service providers or bulk SMS aggregators customers as \"trading\" activity. We sell services to these customers who then onsell to their customers, delivering voice or SMS messages. Since the aggregator is our customer, revenue is recognized on a gross basis with related costs included in cost of sales.\nCustomer Equipment and Shipping Revenue\nRevenue is generated from sales of customer equipment to wholesalers or directly to customers for replacement devices, or for upgrading their device at the time of customer sign-up for which we charge an additional fee. In addition, customer equipment and shipping revenues include revenues from the sale of VoIP telephones in order to access our small and medium business services. Customer equipment and shipping revenues also include the fees that customers are charged for shipping their customer equipment to them. Customer equipment and shipping revenues include sales to our wholeslaers, who subsequently resell this customer equipment to customers. Revenues are reduced for payments to retailers and rebates to customers to the extent of customer equipment and shipping revenues.\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Refer to Item 15, Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information on the adoption of ASU 2014-09.\nValuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had goodwill of $373,764 consisting of $149,328 associated with the acquisition of Nexmo, which comprises the CPaaS reporting unit, and $224,436 associated with the acquisitions of iCore, Simple Signal, Telesphere and gUnify, which collectively comprise the UCaaS reporting unit. The Company does not have any goodwill allocated to its Consumer segment as of December 31, 2017. In addition, the Company recognized intangible assets measured primarily based upon significant inputs that are not observable in the market and represent Level 3 measurements as defined by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements. Intangible assets acquired in the settlement of litigation or by direct purchase are accounted for based upon the fair value of assets received.\n43 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2017\nThe Company applies ASC 805, Business Combinations and ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other to account for goodwill and intangible assets. The Company amortizes all finite-lived intangible assets over their respective estimated useful lives while goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized. Goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment on an annual basis on October 1st and, when specific circumstances dictate, between annual tests. The Company tests for goodwill at the reporting unit level, which is identified by assessing whether the components of the Company's operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available. With respect to the annual goodwill impairment test, the Company identified the UCaaS and CPaaS reporting units which collectively represent the Business segment. The goodwill impairment test involves evaluating qualitative information to determine if it is more than 50% likely that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If such a determination is made or if the Company chooses not to utilize a qualitative approach, then the traditional two-step goodwill impairment test described below is applied. The first step, identifying a potential impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step would need to be conducted; otherwise, no further steps are necessary as no potential impairment exists. The second step, measuring the impairment loss, compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. Any excess of the reporting unit goodwill carrying value over the respective implied fair value is recognized as an impairment loss. There was no impairment of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Company performed step one of the two-step impairment test for its UCaaS and CPaaS reporting units as of October 1, 2017 utilizing the income approach. Under the income approach, the Company estimated that the fair value of the reporting units' invested capital exceeded its carrying value and, as such, the Company concluded that goodwill associated with the reporting units in the following table is not impaired:\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reporting Unit (Segment)\n</td> <td>% Fair Value Over Carrying Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>UCaaS (Business)\n</td> <td>392\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CPaaS (Business)\n</td> <td>295\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe perform a review of purchased-intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than we had originally estimated or that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances exist, we assess the recoverability of purchased-intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairments, if any, are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. If the useful life of the asset is shorter than originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of amortization and amortize the remaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life. There was no impairment of purchased-intangible assets identified for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, or 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities at enacted income tax rates for the temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Any effects of changes in income tax rates or tax laws are included in the provision for income taxes in the period of enactment. Our net deferred tax assets primarily consist of net operating loss carry forwards, or NOLs,. We are required to record a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets if we conclude that it is more likely than not that taxable income generated in the future will be insufficient to utilize the future income tax benefit from our net deferred tax assets (namely, the NOLs) prior to expiration. We periodically review this conclusion, which requires significant management judgment. If we are able to conclude in a future period that a future income tax benefit from our net deferred tax assets has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized, we are required in that period to reduce the related valuation allowance with a corresponding decrease in income tax expense. This would result in a non-cash benefit to our net income in the period of the determination. In subsequent periods, we would expect to recognize income tax expense equal to our pre-tax income multiplied by our effective income tax rate, an expense that was not recognized prior to the reduction of the valuation allowance.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had NOLs for United States federal and state tax purposes, including those NOLs acquired as part of past business combinations, of $556,368 and $146,254, respectively, expiring at various times from years ending through 2037. In addition, we had NOLs for United Kingdom tax purposes of $50,142 with no expiration date.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, if we undergo an ownership change\u201d which is generally defined as a greater than 50% change by value in our equity ownership over a three-year period, our ability to use our pre-change of control NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes against our post-change income may be limited. The Section 382 limitation is applied annually so as to limit the use of our pre-change NOLs to an amount that generally equals the value of our stock immediately before the ownership change multiplied by a designated federal long-term tax-exempt rate. At December 31, 2017, there were no limitations on the use of our NOLs except for the NOLs of Vocalocity as of the date of acquisition for which the Company has reflected in the deferred tax asset.\n44 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2017\nCapitalized Software\nCapitalized costs include external consulting fees, payroll related cost for employees who are directly associated with, and who devote time to, the Company's internal-use software projects. Capitalization begins when the planning stage is complete, and continues during the application"}
