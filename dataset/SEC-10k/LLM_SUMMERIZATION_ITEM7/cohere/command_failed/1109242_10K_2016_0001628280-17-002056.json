Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis discussion presents management's analysis of the financial condition and results of operations as of and for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes related thereto presented elsewhere in this Report. See also Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe have established various accounting policies that govern the application of GAAP in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses. Our financial position and results of operations can be materially affected by these estimates and assumptions. Critical accounting policies are those policies that are most important to the determination of our financial condition and results of operations or that require management to make assumptions and estimates that are subjective or complex. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d Management believes that the following policies are critical.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Allowance for Off-Balance Sheet Items\nOur allowance for loan and lease losses methodologies incorporate a variety of risk considerations, both quantitative and qualitative, in establishing an allowance for loan and lease losses that management believes is appropriate at each reporting date. Quantitative factors include our historical loss experiences on segmented loan pools by type and risk rating, delinquency and charge-off trends, collateral values, changes in nonperforming loans and leases, and other factors. Qualitative factors include the general economic environment in our markets, delinquency and charge-off trends, and the change in nonperforming loans and leases. Concentration of credit, change of lending management and staff, quality of the loan and lease review system, and changes in interest rates are other qualitative factors that are considered in our methodologies. See Financial Condition - Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Allowance for Off-Balance Sheet Items,\u201d Results of Operations - Provision for Credit Losses\u201d and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d for additional information on methodologies used to determine the allowance for loan and lease losses and the allowance for off-balance sheet items.\nLoan Sales\nThe guaranteed portions of certain SBA loans are normally sold to secondary market investors. When SBA loans are sold, we generally retain the right to service the loans. We record a loan servicing asset when the benefits of servicing are expected to be more than adequate compensation to a servicer, which is determined by discounting all of the future net cash flows associated with the contractual rights and obligations of the servicing agreement. The expected future net cash flows are discounted at a rate equal to the return that would adequately compensate a substitute servicer for performing the servicing. In addition to the anticipated rate of loan prepayments and discount rates, other assumptions (such as the cost to service the underlying loans, foreclosure costs, ancillary income and float rates) are also used in determining the value of the loan servicing assets. Loan servicing assets are discussed in more detail in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 6 - Servicing Assets and Liabilities\u201d presented elsewhere herein.\nPurchased Credit Impaired Loans\nPurchased credit impaired ( PCI\u201d) loans are accounted for in accordance with ASC Subtopic 310-30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality.\u201d A purchased loan is deemed to be credit impaired when there is evidence of credit deterioration since its origination and it is probable at the acquisition date that we would be unable to collect all contractually required payments. We apply PCI loan accounting when (i) we acquire loans deemed to be impaired, and (ii) as a general policy election for non-impaired loans that we acquire in a distressed bank acquisition.\nFor PCI loans, at the time of acquisition we (i) calculated the contractual amount and timing of undiscounted principal and interest payments (the undiscounted contractual cash flows\u201d) and (ii) estimated the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal and interest payments (the undiscounted expected cash flows\u201d). The difference between the undiscounted contractual cash flows and the undiscounted expected cash flows is the nonaccretable difference. The nonaccretable difference represents an estimate of the loss exposure of principal and interest related to the PCI loan portfolios; such amount is subject to change over time based on the performance of such loans. The carrying value of PCI loans is reduced by payments received, both principal and interest, and increased by the portion of the accretable yield recognized as interest income.\nThe excess of expected cash flows at acquisition over the initial fair value of acquired impaired loans is referred to as the accretable yield\u201d and is recorded as interest income over the estimated life of the loans using the effective yield. If estimated cash flows are indeterminable, the recognition of interest income will cease to be recognized.\nAs part of the fair value process and the subsequent accounting, the Company aggregates PCI loans into pools having common credit risk characteristics such as product type, geographic location and risk rating. Increases in expected cash flows over those previously estimated increase the accretable yield and are recognized as interest income prospectively. Decreases in the amount and changes in the timing of expected cash flows compared to those previously estimated decrease the accretable yield and usually result in a provision for loan losses and the establishment of an allowance for loan losses. As the accretable yield increases or decreases from changes in cash flow expectations, the offset is a decrease or increase to the nonaccretable difference. The accretable yield is measured at each financial reporting date based on information then currently available and represents the difference between the remaining undiscounted expected cash flows and the current carrying value of the loans. In addition, the Company removes loans from loan pools when the Company receives payment in settlement with the borrower, sells the loan, or foreclose upon the collateral securing the loan. The Company recognizes \"Disposition gain on Purchased Credit Impaired Loans\" when the cash proceeds or the amount received are in excess of the loan's carrying amount. The removal of the loan from the loan pool and the recognition of disposition gains do not affect the then applicable loan pool accretable yield.\nBelow is a summary of acquired purchased credit impaired loans as of the acquisition date, August 31, 2014 and December 31, 2016.\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

there is an expectation that the estimated cash flows will be received. If the timing and amount of cash flows is not reasonably estimable, the loans may be classified as nonaccrual with interest income recognized on either a cash basis or as a reduction of the principal amount outstanding.\nSecurities\nThe classification and accounting for securities are discussed in more detail in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 5 - Securities\u201d presented elsewhere herein. Under FASB ASC 320, Investments,\u201d securities generally must be classified as held to maturity, available for sale or trading. The appropriate classification is based partially on our ability to hold the securities to maturity and largely on management's\nintentions with respect to either holding or selling the securities. The classification of securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities. Unrealized gains and losses on trading securities flow directly through earnings during the periods in which they arise. Securities that are classified as held to maturity are recorded at amortized cost. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are recorded as a separate component of stockholders' equity (accumulated other comprehensive income or loss) and do not affect earnings until realized or are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired.\nThe fair values of securities are generally determined by quoted market prices obtained from independent external brokers or independent external pricing service providers who have experience in valuing these securities. In obtaining such valuation information from third parties, we have evaluated the methodologies used to develop the resulting fair values. We perform a monthly review of alternative pricing received from third parties to ensure that the prices represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value. The procedures include, but are not limited to, initial and on-going review of third party pricing methodologies, review of pricing trends, and monitoring of trading volumes.\nWe review securities on an ongoing basis for the presence of other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) or permanent impairment, taking into consideration current market conditions, fair value in relationship to cost, extent and nature of the change in fair value, issuer rating changes and trends, whether we intend to sell a security or if it is likely that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost basis of the investment, which may be maturity, and other factors.\nFor debt securities, the classification of OTTI depends on whether we intend to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its costs basis, and on the nature of the impairment. If we intend to sell a security or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, an OTTI write-down is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the security's amortized cost basis and its fair value. If we do not intend to sell the security or it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, the OTTI write-down is separated into an amount representing credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and the amount related to all other factors, which is recognized in other comprehensive income net of tax. A credit loss is the difference between the cost basis of the security and the present value of cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the security's effective interest rate at the date of acquisition. The cost basis of an other than temporarily impaired security is written down by the amount of impairment recognized in earnings. The new cost basis is not adjusted for subsequent recoveries in fair value.\nManagement does not believe that there are any securities that are deemed OTTI as of December 31, 2016.\nIncome Taxes\nIn accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 740, the Company periodically reviews its income tax positions based on tax laws and regulations and financial reporting considerations, and records adjustments as appropriate. This review takes into consideration the status of current taxing authorities' examinations of the Company's tax returns, recent positions taken by the taxing authorities on similar transactions, if any, and the overall tax environment.\nAs of each reporting date, management considers the realization of deferred tax assets based on management's judgment of various future events and uncertainties, including the timing and amount of future income, as well as the implementation of various tax planning strategies to maximize realization of deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of December 31, 2016, management determined that a valuation allowance of $1.0 million was appropriate against certain state net operating losses. For all other deferred tax assets, management believes it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized principally through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. Management further believes that future taxable income will be sufficient to realize the benefits of temporary deductible differences that cannot be realized through carry-back to prior years or through the reversal of future temporary taxable differences.\nIncome taxes are discussed in more detail in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 12 - Income Taxes\u201d presented elsewhere herein.\nExecutive Overview\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, net income was $56.5 million, $53.8 million and $49.8 million, respectively. The increase in net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was due mainly to the increase in net interest income by 8.2 percent or $12.1 million, primarily because of an increase in loans and leases receivable, a decrease in income tax expense and lower noninterest expense, offset by the impact of lower gain on sales of securities, disposition gains on PCI loans and lower negative provision for loan and lease losses.\nThe increase in net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was due mainly to the growth in net interest income from the 20 percent increase in average interest-earning assets, higher levels of SBA loan sales and their related gains, and higher amounts of disposition gains on PCI loans and securities, reduced by increased amounts of noninterest expenses reflecting the CBI Acquisition.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our earnings per diluted share were $1.75, $1.68 and $1.56, respectively.\nSignificant financial highlights include:\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>With new loan growth and the acquisition of the equipment leasing portfolio, loans and leases receivable increased by $661.5 million, or 20.8 percent, to $3.84 billion as of December 31, 2016, compared to $3.18 billion as of December 31, 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Deposits were $3.81 billion at December 31, 2016 compared to $3.51 billion at December 31, 2015 as noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased $47.7 million, or 4.1 percent, interest-bearing money market and savings accounts increased $457.5 million or 52.5 percent and time deposits decreased $207.7 million, or 15.0 percent.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cash dividends of $0.66 per share of common stock were declared for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $0.47 and $0.28 per share of common stock for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations\nImpact of Acquisitions on Earnings Performance\nThe comparability of financial information was affected by our acquisition of CBI on August 31, 2014 ($1.27 billion in assets). The transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and accordingly, the related operating results have been included in the consolidated financial statements from the respective acquisition date. We also acquired an equipment leasing portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2016. However, due to the size and timing of the 2016 transaction, the comparability of financial information was not significantly impacted by such transaction. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2 - Acquisitions.\u201d\nNet Interest Income\nOur primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is the difference between interest and fees derived from earning assets, and interest paid on liabilities obtained to fund those assets. Our net interest income is affected by changes in the level and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as volume changes. Net interest income is also affected by changes in the yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities, referred to as rate changes. Interest rates charged on loans and leases are affected principally by changes to interest rates, the demand for such loans and leases, the supply of money available for lending purposes, and other competitive factors. Those factors are, in turn, affected by general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control, such as federal economic policies, the general supply of money in the economy, legislative tax policies, governmental budgetary matters, and the actions of the Federal Reserve.\nThe following table shows the average balances of assets, liabilities and stockholders' equity; the amount of interest income, on a tax equivalent basis and interest expense; the average yield or rate for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; and the net interest spread and the net interest margin for the periods indicated. All average balances are daily average balances.\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

$164.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest expense increased $2.2 million or 13.4 percent, to $18.3 million in 2016 from $16.1 million in 2015. Net interest income, on a taxable equivalent basis, was $162.2 million and $148.5 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in net interest income was primarily attributable to the growth in average loans and leases and the higher percentage of loans and leases in the mix of interest-earning assets. Average loans and leases were 83.4 percent of average interest earning assets for 2016, up from 76.2 percent for 2015. The net interest spread and net interest margin, on a taxable equivalent basis, for the year ended December 31, 2016 were 3.71 percent and 3.95 percent, respectively, compared with 3.67 percent and 3.90 percent, respectively, for the same period in 2015. Excluding the effects of acquisition accounting adjustments, net interest margin was 3.79 percent and 3.47 percent for 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nAverage loans and leases increased $521.6 million, or 18.0 percent, to $3.42 billion in 2016 from $2.90 billion in 2015. Average securities decreased $173.4 million, or 22.0 percent, to $614.7 million in 2016 from $788.2 million in 2015. Average interest earning assets increased $298.1 million, or 7.8 percent, to $4.10 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $3.81 billion for the same period in 2015. The increase in average loans and leases was due mainly to new loan production. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $147.4 million, or 5.9 percent, to $2.64 billion in 2016 compared to $2.49 billion in 2015. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities resulted primarily from an increase in FHLB advances and growth in money market and savings deposits, offset by a decrease in average time deposits.\nThe average yield on loans and leases decreased to 4.81 percent for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 5.13 percent in 2015, primarily due to lower loan and lease yields and a decrease in discount accretion on purchased loans and leases. The average yield on securities, on a taxable equivalent basis, increased to 2.15 percent in 2016 from 1.62 in 2015, attributable primarily to increases in balances and yields on mortgage-backed securities. The average yield on interest-earning assets, on a\ntaxable equivalent basis, increased 8 basis points to 4.40 percent in 2016 from 4.32 percent in 2015, due mainly to the higher percentage of loans and leases in the mix of interest-earning assets. The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased by 4 basis points to 0.69 percent in 2016 from 0.65 percent in 2015. The increase was due to increases in the cost of deposits and borrowings.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, net interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, was $148.5 million and $122.8 million, respectively. The increase in net interest income in 2015 as compared to 2014, was due mainly to the 18.9 percent increase in average loans and leases. In addition, the net accretion of discount on loans and leases and interest-bearing liabilities acquired in the CBI Acquisition was $16.5 million and $7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The net interest spread and net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 were 3.67 percent and 3.90 percent, respectively, as compared to 3.65 percent and 3.88 percent, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014. Excluding the effects of acquisition accounting adjustments, the net interest margin was 3.47 and 3.65 percent for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nAverage loans and leases were $2.90 billion in 2015 as compared with $2.44 billion in 2014, representing an increase of 18.9 percent. Average securities were $788.2 million in 2015 as compared with $648.9 million in 2014, representing an increase of 21.5 percent. Average interest-earning assets increased to $3.81 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared with $3.16 billion in 2014, representing an increase of 20.3 percent. The increase in average interest-earning assets was due mainly to the growth in loans and leases. Average interest-bearing liabilities were $2.49 billion in 2015 as compared to $2.05 billion in 2014, representing an increase of 21.4 percent. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities in 2015 was due primarily to the growth in deposits.\nThe average yield on loans and leases increased by 12 basis points to 5.13 percent in 2015 from 5.01 percent in 2014. The increase reflects the full-year effects of purchase accounting. Absent the effects of purchase accounting, loan and lease yields declined in 2015 and 2014 reflecting the low interest rate environment and higher level of competition. The average yield on interest-earning assets decreased by 1 basis point to 4.32 percent in 2015 from 4.33 percent in 2014. The average cost on interest-bearing liabilities decreased by 3 basis points to 0.65 percent in 2015 from 0.68 percent in 2014.\nProvision for Loan and Lease Losses\nIn anticipation of credit risks inherent in our lending business, we set aside an allowance for loan and lease losses through charges to earnings. These charges are made not only for our outstanding loan and lease portfolio, but also for off-balance sheet items, such as commitments to extend credit, or letters of credit. The charges made for our outstanding loan and lease portfolio are recorded to the allowance for loan and lease losses, whereas charges for off-balance sheet items are recorded to the reserve for off-balance sheet items, and are presented as a component of other liabilities.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nMost credit metrics continue to improve as the overall quality of the loan and lease portfolio improved in 2016. Therefore, a negative loan and lease loss provision of $4.3 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016, which included a $0.7 million provision for losses on PCI loans, compared to a negative loan and lease loss provision of $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which included a $4.4 million provision for losses on PCI loans. The charge to other noninterest expense for losses on off-balance sheet items was $0.2 million in 2016 compared to a credit of $0.4 million for the same period in 2015.\nNet loan and lease charge-offs were $6.2 million, or 0.18 percent of average loans and leases, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to net recoveries of $1.9 million, or 0.06 percent of average loans and leases, for the year ended December 31, 2015. The charge-offs in 2016 included $5.1 million of PCI loans net charge-offs compared to no PCI loans charge-offs or recoveries in 2015.\nClassified loans and leases (excluding PCI loans) decreased by $9.0 million, or 23.1 percent, to $30.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $39.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nAll other credit metrics also experienced improvements as the quality of the loan and lease portfolio improved in 2015. Therefore, a negative loan and lease loss provision of $11.6 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015, which included a $4.4 million provision for losses on PCI loans, compared to a negative loan and lease loss provision of $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which included a $1.0 million provision for losses on PCI loans.\nNet loan and lease recoveries were $1.9 million, or 0.06 percent of average loans and leases, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1.4 million, or 0.06 percent of average loans and leases, for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nClassified loans and leases (excluding PCI loans) decreased by $8.1 million, or 17.1 percent, to $39.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $47.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nSee Nonperforming Assets\u201d and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Allowance for Off-Balance Sheet Items\u201d for further details.\nNoninterest Income\nThe following table sets forth the various components of non-interest income for the years indicated:\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service charges on deposit accounts\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade finance and other service charges and fees\n</td> <td>4,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating income\n</td> <td>6,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal service charges, fees and other income\n</td> <td>22,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of SBA loans\n</td> <td>6,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Disposition gains on PCI loans\n</td> <td>4,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gain on sales of securities\n</td> <td>46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bargain purchase gain, net of deferred taxes\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total noninterest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 Compared to 2015\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, noninterest income was $33.1 million, a decrease of $14.5 million, or 30.5 percent, compared with $47.6 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower securities transactions and lower gains from the resolution or disposition of PCI loans. Sales of securities resulted in a net gain of $46,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with gains of $6.6 million in 2015. When a PCI loan is removed from a loan pool and the cash proceeds or assets received from the settlement of the loan are in excess of its carrying amount, we recognize such gains as disposition gains. Disposition gains on PCI loans were $5.0 million in 2016 compared with $10.2 million in 2015 as PCI loans declined $10.2 million in 2016 compared with $24.5 million decline in 2015. The increase in other operating income included a $1.0 million gain on sale of a branch facility during the third quarter of 2016.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, noninterest income was $47.6 million, an increase of $5.3 million, or 12.5 percent, from $42.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to higher gains on dispositions of PCI loans, securities transactions and SBA loan sales, offset by the absence of the 2014 $14.6 million after-tax bargain purchase gain. Service charges, fees and other income for the year ended December 31, 2015, was up 6.2 percent to $22.1 million from $20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Gains on sales of SBA loans were $8.7 million, compared to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in gains on SBA loans primarily relates to an increase in SBA loans sold to $89.1 million in 2015 from $42.4 million in 2014. Disposition gains on PCI loans were $10.2 million in 2015. PCI loans were $20.0 million at December 31, 2015, down $24.5 million or 55.0 percent, from $44.5 million at December 31, 2014.\nNoninterest Expense\nThe following table sets forth the breakdown of noninterest expense for the years indicated: Table 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries and employee benefits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Occupancy and equipment\n</td> <td>14,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Data processing\n</td> <td>5,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional fees\n</td> <td>5,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Supplies and communications\n</td> <td>2,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising and promotion\n</td> <td>3,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merger and integration costs\n</td> <td>312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OREO expense (income)\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(49\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses\n</td> <td>10,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total noninterest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>108,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>115,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>98,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 Compared to 2015\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, noninterest expense was $108.2 million, a decrease of $7.1 million or 6.2 percent, compared with $115.3 in 2015. The decrease was due primarily to reductions in merger and integration costs, professional fees and data processing fees related to the CBI Acquisition, along with lower occupancy and equipment expense from the branch closures and consolidations completed in the third quarter 2015.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, noninterest expense was $115.3 million, an increase of $16.7 million or 16.9 percent, compared to $98.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was due primarily to the full impact of the August 2014 acquisition. The largest component of noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was salaries and employee benefits, which represented 54.5 percent of total noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015. Salaries and employee benefits increased $12.7 million, or 25.3 percent, to $62.9 million, compared to $50.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, due mainly to the increase in personnel arising from the acquisition.\nIncome Tax Expense\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, provision for income taxes were $32.9 million, $38.2 million and $22.9 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was 36.8 percent, 41.5 percent and 31.5 percent, respectively. The lower effective tax rate in 2016 included a $1.8 million benefit arising from the finalization of the 2014 amended income tax returns. The higher effective tax rate for 2015 reflects a higher level of state taxes and the lower effective tax rate for 2014 reflects the impact of the $14.6 million after-tax bargain purchase gain recognized in 2014.\nIncome taxes are discussed in more detail in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 12 - Income Taxes\u201d presented elsewhere herein.\nFinancial Condition\nSecurities Portfolio\nSecurities are classified as held to maturity, available for sale, or trading in accordance with GAAP. Those securities that we have the ability and the intent to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity.\u201d All other securities are classified either as available for sale\u201d or trading.\u201d There were no held to maturity or trading securities as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. Securities classified as held to maturity are stated at cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and available for sale and trading securities are stated at fair value. The composition of our securities portfolio reflects our investment strategy of providing a relatively stable source of interest income while maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity. Our securities portfolio also provides a source of liquidity by pledging as collateral or through repurchase agreement and collateral for certain public funds deposits.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our securities portfolio was composed primarily of U.S. government mortgage-backed securities, municipal securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. Most of the securities carried fixed interest rates. Other than holdings of U.S. government agency securities, there were no securities of any one issuer exceeding 10 percent of stockholders' equity as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nThe following

improvements. These loans are either owner-occupied or non-owner occupied. The Bank originates these loans using underwriting guidelines which include minimum debt service ability, maximum loan to values, and analyzing the borrower's future capacity to repay the loan.\nCommercial and industrial loans are extended to businesses on a term or line of credit basis. The Bank provides commercial term loans for the purposes of purchasing business, equipment, leasehold improvements or working capital, with maturities ranging from three to seven years. The Bank also provides commercial lines of credit for the purposes of short term working capital, financing trading assets, or import and export financing. These lines of credit usually have maturities of one year.\nLeases receivable include equipment finance agreements with terms ranging from 1 to 7 years. Equipment leases are similar to commercial business loans in that the leases are typically made on the basis of the borrower's ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower's business.\nThe following sets forth the amount of total loans and leases outstanding in each category as of the dates indicated, excluding loans held for sales:\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate loans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial property\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>859,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>740,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>684,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hotel/motel\n</td> <td>651,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>543,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>462,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gas station\n</td> <td>262,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>323,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>370,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (1)\n</td> <td>1,109,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>978,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>848,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction\n</td> <td>55,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential property\n</td> <td>338,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>236,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total real estate loans\n</td> <td>3,278,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,845,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,511,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial and industrial loans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial term\n</td> <td>138,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>152,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial lines of credit\n</td> <td>136,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International loans\n</td> <td>25,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total commercial and industrial loans\n</td> <td>300,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>312,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>249,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leases receivable\n</td> <td>243,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer loans (2)\n</td> <td>22,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans and leases receivable\n</td> <td>3,844,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,183,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,788,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for loans and lease losses\n</td> <td>(32,429\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(42,935\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(52,666\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans and leases receivable, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,812,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,140,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,735,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes, among other property types, mixed-use, apartment, office, industrial, faith-based facilities and warehouse; the remaining real estate categories represents less than one percent of the Bank's total loans and leases.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Consumer loans include home equity lines of credit.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n.As of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, loans and leases receivable (excluding loans held for sale), net of deferred loan costs, discounts and allowance for loan and lease losses, totaled $3.81 billion, $3.14 billion and $2.74 billion, respectively, representing an increase of $672.0 million or 21.4 percent in 2016, and $404.6 million, or 14.8 percent in 2015. The $672.0 million increase in loans and leases in 2016 was attributable primarily to a $10.5 million decrease in the allowance for loan and lease losses and a $661.5 million, or 20.8 percent net increase in loans and leases which includes the $228.2 million acquisition of an equipment lease portfolio.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, total loan and lease disbursements consisted of $619.4 million in commercial real estate loans, $131.6 million in SBA loans, $81.8 million in commercial and industrial loans, and $398.3 million for loan and lease purchases.

still accruing interest. Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans and leases and other real estate owned ( OREO\u201d). Non-purchased credit impaired ( Non-PCI\u201d) loans are placed on nonaccrual status when, in the opinion of management, the full timely collection of principal or interest is in doubt. Generally, the accrual of interest is discontinued when principal or interest payments become more than 90 days past due, unless management believes the loan is adequately collateralized and in the process of collection. However, in certain instances, we may place a particular loan on nonaccrual status earlier, depending upon the individual circumstances surrounding the loan's delinquency. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, previously accrued but unpaid interest is reversed against current income. Subsequent collections of cash are applied as principal reductions when received, except when the ultimate collectability of principal is probable, in which case interest payments are credited to income. Nonaccrual loans may be restored to accrual status when principal and interest become current and full repayment is expected, which generally occurs after sustained payment of 6 months. Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis for impaired loans not meeting the criteria for nonaccrual. OREO consists of properties acquired by foreclosure or similar means that management intends to offer for sale.\nExcept for nonperforming loans and leases set forth below, management is not aware of any loans and leases as of December 31, 2016 for which known credit problems of the borrower would cause serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with their present loan or lease repayment terms, or any known events that would result in the loan or lease being designated as nonperforming at some future date. Management cannot, however, predict the extent to which a deterioration in general economic conditions, real estate values, increases in general rates of interest, or changes in the financial condition or business of borrower may adversely affect a borrower's ability to pay.\nThe following table provides information with respect to the components of nonperforming assets (excluding PCI loans) as of the dates indicated: Table 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonperforming non-PCI loans and leases:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate loans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial property\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hotel/motel\n</td> <td>5,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gas station\n</td> <td>1,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>2,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential property\n</td> <td>564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial and industrial loans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial term\n</td> <td>824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial lines of credit\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>466\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leases receivable\n</td> <td>901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer loans\n</td> <td>389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonperforming Non-PCI loans\n</td> <td>11,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans and leases 90 days or more past due and still accruing\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonperforming Non-PCI loans and leases (1)\n</td> <td>11,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other real estate owned\n</td> <td>7,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonperforming assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonperforming Non-PCI loans and leases as a percentage of loans and leases receivable\n</td> <td>0.30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.60\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.91\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonperforming assets as a percentage of assets\n</td> <td>0.40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.65\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.97\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Troubled debt restructured performing loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Include troubled debt restructured nonperforming loans of $6.9 million, $6.9 million and $12.5 million as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Nonaccrual Non-PCI loans and leases totaled $11.4 million, $19.1 million and $25.3 million as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, representing a decrease of $7.7 million or 40.3 percent, in 2016 and a decrease of $6.2 million or\n24.5 percent, in 2015. There were no PCI loans on nonaccrual as of December 31, 2016. Delinquent Non-PCI loans and leases (defined as 30 to 89 days past due and still accruing) were $7.3 million, $6.7 million and $16.4 million as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, representing an increase of $0.6 million or 9.0 percent, in 2016 and a decrease of $9.7 million, or 59.1 percent, in 2015.\nThe ratio of nonperforming Non-PCI loans and leases to loans and leases receivable decreased to 0.30 percent at December 31, 2016 from 0.60 percent and 0.92 percent at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Of the $11.4 million nonperforming Non-PCI loans and leases as of December 31, 2016, $9.9 million were impaired based on the definition contained in FASB ASC 310, Receivables, which resulted in aggregate impairment reserves of $3.6 million. The allowance for collateral-dependent loans is calculated as the difference between the outstanding loan balance and the value of the collateral as determined by recent appraisals less estimated costs to sell. The allowance for collateral-dependent loans varies from loan to loan based on the collateral coverage of the loan at the time of designation as nonperforming. We continue to monitor the collateral coverage, based on recent appraisals, on these loans on a quarterly basis and adjust the allowance accordingly.\nAs of December 31, 2016, OREO consisted of 12 properties with a combined carrying value of $7.5 million. As of December 31, 2015, there were 14 properties with a combined carrying value of $8.5 million, respectively.\nImpaired Loans\nWe evaluate loan impairment in accordance with applicable GAAP. Loans are considered impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement, including scheduled interest payments. Impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or, as an expedient, at the loan's observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent, less costs to sell. If the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, the deficiency will be charged off against the allowance for loan losses or, alternatively, a specific allocation will be established. Additionally, impaired loans are specifically excluded from the quarterly migration analysis when determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses required for the period.\nThe following table provides information on impaired loans (excluding PCI loans) as of the dates indicated: Table 127: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Recorded\nInvestment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Recorded\nInvestment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Recorded\nInvestment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate loans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial property\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hotel/motel\n</td> <td>6,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gas station\n</td> <td>4,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>6,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential property\n</td> <td>2,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial and industrial loans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial term\n</td> <td>4,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial lines of credit\n</td> <td>68\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>466\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International loans\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer loans\n</td> <td>419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Non-PCI loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nImpaired loans were $26.4 million, $35.9 million and $45.9 million as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, representing a decrease of $9.5 million, or 26.5 percent, in 2016, and $10.0 million, or 21.8 percent, in 2015.

with a net carrying value of $4.2 million at the time of modification, which we subsequently classified as TDRs. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we restructured monthly payments for 14 loans, with a net carrying value of $3.2 million at the time of modification, which we subsequently classified as TDRs. Temporary payment structure modifications included, but were not limited to, extending the maturity date, reducing the amount of principal and/or interest due monthly, and/or allowing for interest only monthly payments for six months or less.\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, TDRs on accrual status totaled $11.1 million and $10.3 million, respectively, all of which were temporary interest rate and payment reductions or extensions of maturity, and a $740,000 and $899,000 reserve relating to these loans, respectively, was included in the allowance for loan losses. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, restructured loans on nonaccrual status totaled $6.9 million and $6.9 million, respectively, and a $2.6 million and $128,000 reserve relating to these loans, respectively, was included in the allowance for loan losses.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Allowance for Off-Balance Sheet Items\nThe Bank charges or credits the income statement for provisions to the allowance for loan and lease losses and the allowance for off-balance sheet items at least quarterly based upon the allowance need. The allowance is determined through an analysis involving quantitative calculations based on historic loss rates and qualitative adjustments for general reserves and individual impairment calculations for specific allocations. The Bank charges the allowance for actual losses and credits the allowance for recoveries on loans and leases previously charged-off.\nThe Bank evaluates the allowance methodology at least annually. For the fourth quarter of, the Bank utilized a 24-quarter look-back period with equal weighting to all quarters. For the fourth quarter of 2015, the Bank utilized a 20-quarter look-back period. In addition, the estimated loss emergence period utilized in the Bank's loss migration analysis changed to 2.5 years in 2016 from estimated 1.0 year in 2015. Moreover, in the fourth quarter of 2015, the Bank reevaluated the qualitative adjustments, reducing their affect in light of the lengthening of the business cycle and the continued improvement in credit metrics. In the first quarter of 2014, based upon a similar evaluation, the Bank utilized a 16-quarter look-back period, weighting the loss factors 46 percent for the most recent four-quarter period and 31 percent, 15 percent, and 8 percent for each of the following four-quarter periods, respectively. The change in methodology did not materially affect the amount of the allowance at December 31, 2016, 2015 or 2014.\n.\nTo determine general reserve requirements, in 2016 existing loans were divided into eleven general loan pools of risk-rated loans as well as three homogenous loan pools and in 2015, existing loans were divided into fourteen general loan pools of risk-rated loans as well as three homogenous loan pools. In 2016, the pooling was revised to eliminate loan types that can be combined under a broader category in order to maintain an accurate analysis of the defined segmentation. For risk-rated loans, migration analysis allocates historical losses by loan pool and risk grade to determine risk factors for potential loss inherent in the current outstanding loan portfolio. Since the homogeneous loans are bulk graded, the risk grade is not factored into the historical loss analysis. In addition, specific reserves are allocated for loans deemed impaired.\u201d\nWhen determining the appropriate level for allowance for loan losses, management considers qualitative adjustments for any factors that are likely to cause estimated loan and lease losses associated with the Bank's current portfolio to differ from historical loss experience, including, but not limited to, national and local economic and business conditions, volume and geographic concentrations, and problem loan and lease trends.\nTo systematically quantify the credit risk impact of trends and changes within the loan and lease portfolio, a credit risk matrix is utilized. The qualitative factors are considered on a loan pool by loan pool basis subsequent to, and in conjunction with, a loss migration analysis. The credit risk matrix provides various scenarios with positive or negative impact on the portfolio along with corresponding basis points for qualitative adjustments.\nThe following table reflects our allocation of allowance for loan and lease losses by loan category as well as the loans receivable for each loan type: Table 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

</tr>\n</table>\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses was $32.4 million, $42.9 million and $52.7 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, representing a decrease of $10.5 million, or 24.5 percent, in 2016 and a decrease of $9.7 million, or 18.5 percent, in 2015. Allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of gross loans and lease decreased to 0.84 percent as of December 31, 2016 from 1.35 percent as of December 31, 2015. The decrease in allowance for loan and lease losses as of December 31, 2016 was due primarily to improvements in classified loans and lease and other asset quality indicators. Non-PCI loan and lease reserves decreased by $6.0 million to $31.5 million as of December 31, 2016 and PCI loan reserves decreased by $4.4 million to $1.0 million mainly due to $5.1 million of charge-offs recorded against the reserve for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe allowance for off-balance sheet exposure, primarily unfunded loan commitments, as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $1.2 million, $1.0 million and $1.4 million, respectively, representing an increase of $0.2 million, or 20.1 percent, in 2016, a decrease of $0.4 million, or 27.8 percent, in 2015 and an increase of $0.1 million, or 9.5 percent, in 2014. The Bank closely monitors the borrower's repayment capabilities, while funding existing commitments to ensure losses are minimized. Based on management's evaluation and analysis of portfolio credit quality and prevailing economic conditions, we believe these reserves are adequate for losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio and off-balance sheet exposure as of December 31, 2015.\nThe following table presents a summary of net recoveries (charge-offs) by the Non-PCI loan and lease portfolio:\nTable 131: <table><tr><td>

At December 31, 2016, advances from the FHLB were $315.0 million, an increase of $145.0 million from $170.0 million at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, all FHLB advances have remaining maturities of less than one year, and the weighted-average interest rate at December 31, 2016 was 0.45 percent. See Note 10 - FHLB Advances and Other Borrowings\u201d for more details.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nInterest rate risk indicates our exposure to market interest rate fluctuations. The movement of interest rates directly and inversely affects the economic value of fixed-rate assets, which is the present value of future cash flows discounted by the current interest rate; under the same conditions, the higher the current interest rate, the higher the denominator of discounting. Interest rate risk management is intended to decrease or increase the level of our exposure to market interest rates. The level of interest rate risk can be managed through such means as the changing of gap positions and the volume of fixed-rate assets. For successful management of interest rate risk, we use various methods to measure existing and future interest rate risk exposures, giving effect to historical attrition rates of core deposits. In addition to regular reports used in business operations, repricing gap\nanalysis, stress testing and simulation modeling are the main measurement techniques used to quantify interest rate risk exposure.\nThe following table shows the status of our gap position as of December 31, 2016: Table 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Assets are assigned to maturity and repricing categories based on their expected repayment or repricing dates, and liabilities are assigned based on their repricing or maturity dates. Core deposits that have no maturity dates (demand deposits, savings, and money market checking and NOW accounts) are assigned to categories based on expected decay rates. Gap analysis alone, however, is not necessarily an accurate measurement of interest rate risk because it does not capture the\ntiming and amount of cash flows due to exercise of an early redemption option. For this reason, interest rate risk is also measured using simulation modeling analysis, which takes into consideration option risk.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the cumulative repricing gap for the three-month period was at an asset-sensitive position of 6.92 percent of interest-earning assets, which decreased from 13.56 percent as of December 31, 2015. This decrease was due mainly to a $55.8 million decrease in interest-bearing deposits in other banks, $54.6 million decrease in floating rate loans and leases and a $145.0 million increase in FHLB advances, partially offset by a $53.3 million decrease in time deposits.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the cumulative repricing gap for the twelve-month period was at an asset-sensitive position of 1.85 percent of interest-earning assets, which increased from 1.79 percent as of December 31, 2016. There were shifts in composition of balance sheet including decreases of $55.8 million and $71.5 million in interest-bearing deposits in other banks and floating rate investments, respectively, and increases of $86.6 million and $145 million in money market and savings deposits and FHLB advances, respectively, offset by increases of $117.7 million, $82.1 million and in fixed and floating rate loans and lease, respectively, and a decrease of $188.7 million in time deposits.\nThe following table summarizes the status of the cumulative gap position as of the dates indicated.

We emphasize capital protection through stable earnings rather than maximizing yield. In order to achieve stable earnings, we prudently manage our assets and liabilities and closely monitor the percentage changes in net interest income and equity value in relation to limits established within our guidelines.\nTo supplement traditional gap analysis, we perform simulation modeling to estimate the potential effects of interest rate changes. The following table summarizes one of the stress simulations performed to forecast the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income and the market value of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities reflected on our balance sheet (i.e., an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve of the magnitude indicated below). This sensitivity analysis is compared to policy limits, which specify the maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one-year horizon, given the basis point adjustment in interest rates reflected below.\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Percentage Changes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in Amount\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in\nInterest\nRate\n</td> <td>Net\nInterest\nIncome\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Economic\nValue of\nEquity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net\nInterest\nIncome\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Economic\nValue of\nEquity\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>300%\n</td> <td>(1.60)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.89)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,860\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(34,560\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>200%\n</td> <td>(1.16)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.02)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,063\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(23,575\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>100%\n</td> <td>(0.44)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.03)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(777\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,044\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(100)%\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Results are not meaningful in a low interest rate environment\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The estimated sensitivity does not necessarily represent our forecast, and the results may not be indicative of actual changes to our net interest income. These estimates are based upon a number of assumptions including: the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape, prepayments on loans and leases and securities, pricing strategies on loans and leases and deposits, and replacement of asset and liability cash flows. While the assumptions used are based on current economic and local market conditions, there is no assurance as to the predictive nature of these conditions, including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nCapital Resources\nHistorically, our primary source of capital has been the retention of operating earnings. In order to ensure adequate levels of capital, the Board periodically assesses projected sources and uses of capital in conjunction with projected increases in assets and levels of risk. Management considers, among other things, earnings generated from operations, and access to capital from financial markets through the issuance of additional securities, including common stock or notes, to meet our capital needs.\nAt December 31, 2016, the Bank's total risk-based capital ratio of 13.64 percent, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 12.80 percent, common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 12.80 percent and Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 11.33 percent, placed the Bank in the well capitalized\u201d category, which is defined as institutions with total risk-based capital ratio equal to or greater than 10.00 percent, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio equal to or greater than 8.00 percent, common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.50 percent and Tier 1 leverage capital ratio equal to or greater than 5.00 percent.\nFor a discussion of recently implemented changes to the capital adequacy framework prompted by Basel III and the Dodd-Frank Act, see Note 15 - Regulatory Matters\u201d of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report.\nLiquidity\nFor a discussion of our liquidity position, see Note 22 - Liquidity\u201d of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nFor a discussion of off-balance sheet arrangements, see Note 21 - Off-Balance Sheet Commitments\u201d of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis discussion presents management's analysis of the financial condition and results of operations as of and for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes related thereto presented elsewhere in this Report. See also Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe have established various accounting policies that govern the application of GAAP in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses. Our financial position and results of operations can be materially affected by these estimates and assumptions. Critical accounting policies are those policies that are most important to the determination of our financial condition and results of operations or that require management to make assumptions and estimates that are subjective or complex. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d Management believes that the following policies are critical.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Allowance for Off-Balance Sheet Items\nOur allowance for loan and lease losses methodologies incorporate a variety of risk considerations, both quantitative and qualitative, in establishing an allowance for loan and lease losses that management believes is appropriate at each reporting date. Quantitative factors include our historical loss experiences on segmented loan pools by type and risk rating, delinquency and charge-off trends, collateral values, changes in nonperforming loans and leases, and other factors. Qualitative factors include the general economic environment in our markets, delinquency and charge-off trends, and the change in nonperforming loans and leases. Concentration of credit, change of lending management and staff, quality of the loan and lease review system, and changes in interest rates are other qualitative factors that are considered in our methodologies. See Financial Condition - Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Allowance for Off-Balance Sheet Items,\u201d Results of Operations - Provision for Credit Losses\u201d and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d for additional information on methodologies used to determine the allowance for loan and lease losses and the allowance for off-balance sheet items.\nLoan Sales\nThe guaranteed portions of certain SBA loans are normally sold to secondary market investors. When SBA loans are sold, we generally retain the right to service the loans. We record a loan servicing asset when the benefits of servicing are expected to be more than adequate compensation to a servicer, which is determined by discounting all of the future net cash flows associated with the contractual rights and obligations of the servicing agreement. The expected future net cash flows are discounted at a rate equal to the return that would adequately compensate a substitute servicer for performing the servicing. In addition to the anticipated rate of loan prepayments and discount rates, other assumptions (such as the cost to service the underlying loans, foreclosure costs, ancillary income and float rates) are also used in determining the value of the loan servicing assets. Loan servicing assets are discussed in more detail in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 6 - Servicing Assets and Liabilities\u201d presented elsewhere herein.\nPurchased Credit Impaired Loans\nPurchased credit impaired ( PCI\u201d) loans are accounted for in accordance with ASC Subtopic 310-30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality.\u201d A purchased loan is deemed to be credit impaired when there is evidence of credit deterioration since its origination and it is probable at the acquisition date that we would be unable to collect all contractually required payments. We apply PCI loan accounting when (i) we acquire loans deemed to be impaired, and (ii) as a general policy election for non-impaired loans that we acquire in a distressed bank acquisition.\nFor PCI loans, at the time of acquisition we (i) calculated the contractual amount and timing of undiscounted principal and interest payments (the undiscounted contractual cash flows\u201d) and (ii) estimated the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal and interest payments (the undiscounted expected cash flows\u201d). The difference between the undiscounted contractual cash flows and the undiscounted expected cash flows is the nonaccretable difference. The nonaccretable difference represents an estimate of the loss exposure of principal and interest related to the PCI loan portfolios; such amount is subject to change over time based on the performance of such loans. The carrying value of PCI loans is reduced by payments received, both principal and interest, and increased by the portion of the accretable yield recognized as interest income.\nThe excess of expected cash flows at acquisition over the initial fair value of acquired impaired loans is referred to as the accretable yield\u201d and is recorded as interest income over the estimated life of the loans using the effective yield. If estimated cash flows are indeterminable, the recognition of interest income will cease to be recognized.\nAs part of the fair value process and the subsequent accounting, the Company aggregates PCI loans into pools having common credit risk characteristics such as product type, geographic location and risk rating. Increases in expected cash flows over those previously estimated increase the accretable yield and are recognized as interest income prospectively. Decreases in the amount and changes in the timing of expected cash flows compared to those previously estimated decrease the accretable yield and usually result in a provision for loan losses and the establishment of an allowance for loan losses. As the accretable yield increases or decreases from changes in cash flow expectations, the offset is a decrease or increase to the nonaccretable difference. The accretable yield is measured at each financial reporting date based on information then currently available and represents the difference between the remaining undiscounted expected cash flows and the current carrying value of the loans. In addition, the Company removes loans from loan pools when the Company receives payment in settlement with the borrower, sells the loan, or foreclose upon the collateral securing the loan. The Company recognizes \"Disposition gain on Purchased Credit Impaired Loans\" when the cash proceeds or the amount received are in excess of the loan's carrying amount. The removal of the loan from the loan pool and the recognition of disposition gains do not affect the then applicable loan pool accretable yield.\nBelow is a summary of acquired purchased credit impaired loans as of the acquisition date, August 31, 2014 and December 31, 2016.\n\n\nPCI loans that are contractually past due are still considered to be accruing and performing as long as there is an expectation that the estimated cash flows will be received. If the timing and amount of cash flows is not reasonably estimable, the loans may be classified as nonaccrual with interest income recognized on either a cash basis or as a reduction of the principal amount outstanding.\nSecurities\nThe classification and accounting for securities are discussed in more detail in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 5 - Securities\u201d presented elsewhere herein. Under FASB ASC 320, Investments,\u201d securities generally must be classified as held to maturity, available for sale or trading. The appropriate classification is based partially on our ability to hold the securities to maturity and largely on management's\nintentions with respect to either holding or selling the securities. The classification of securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities. Unrealized gains and losses on trading securities flow directly through earnings during the periods in which they arise. Securities that are classified as held to maturity are recorded at amortized cost. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are recorded as a separate component of stockholders' equity (accumulated other comprehensive income or loss) and do not affect earnings until realized or are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired.\nThe fair values of securities are generally determined by quoted market prices obtained from independent external brokers or independent external pricing service providers who have experience in valuing these securities. In obtaining such valuation information from third parties, we have evaluated the methodologies used to develop the resulting fair values. We perform a monthly review of alternative pricing received from third parties to ensure that the prices represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value. The procedures include, but are not limited to, initial and on-going review of third party pricing methodologies, review of pricing trends, and monitoring of trading volumes.\nWe review securities on an ongoing basis for the presence of other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) or permanent impairment, taking into consideration current market conditions, fair value in relationship to cost, extent and nature of the change in fair value, issuer rating changes and trends, whether we intend to sell a security or if it is likely that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost basis of the investment, which may be maturity, and other factors.\nFor debt securities, the classification of OTTI depends on whether we intend to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its costs basis, and on the nature of the impairment. If we intend to sell a security or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, an OTTI write-down is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the security's amortized cost basis and its fair value. If we do not intend to sell the security or it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, the OTTI write-down is separated into an amount representing credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and the amount related to all other factors, which is recognized in other comprehensive income net of tax. A credit loss is the difference between the cost basis of the security and the present value of cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the security's effective interest rate at the date of acquisition. The cost basis of an other than temporarily impaired security is written down by the amount of impairment recognized in earnings. The new cost basis is not adjusted for subsequent recoveries in fair value.\nManagement does not believe that there are any securities that are deemed OTTI as of December 31, 2016.\nIncome Taxes\nIn accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 740, the Company periodically reviews its income tax positions based on tax laws and regulations and financial reporting considerations, and records adjustments as appropriate. This review takes into consideration the status of current taxing authorities' examinations of the Company's tax returns, recent positions taken by the taxing authorities on similar transactions, if any, and the overall tax environment.\nAs of each reporting date, management considers the realization of deferred tax assets based on management's judgment of various future events and uncertainties, including the timing and amount of future income, as well as the implementation of various tax planning strategies to maximize realization of deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of December 31, 2016, management determined that a valuation allowance of $1.0 million was appropriate against certain state net operating losses. For all other deferred tax assets, management believes it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized principally through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. Management further believes that future taxable income will be sufficient to realize the benefits of temporary deductible differences that cannot be realized through carry-back to prior years or through the reversal of future temporary taxable differences.\nIncome taxes are discussed in more detail in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 12 - Income Taxes\u201d presented elsewhere herein.\nExecutive Overview\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, net income was $56.5 million, $53.8 million and $49.8 million, respectively. The increase in net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was due mainly to the increase in net interest income by 8.2 percent or $12.1 million, primarily because of an increase in loans and leases receivable, a decrease in income tax expense and lower noninterest expense, offset by the impact of lower gain on sales of securities, disposition gains on PCI loans and lower negative provision for loan and lease losses.\nThe increase in net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was due mainly to the growth in net interest income from the 20 percent increase in average interest-earning assets, higher levels of SBA loan sales and their related gains, and higher amounts of disposition gains on PCI loans and securities, reduced by increased amounts of noninterest expenses reflecting the CBI Acquisition.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our earnings per diluted share were $1.75, $1.68 and $1.56, respectively.\nSignificant financial highlights include:\n \u2022 With new loan growth and the acquisition of the equipment leasing portfolio, loans and leases receivable increased by $661.5 million, or 20.8 percent, to $3.84 billion as of December 31, 2016, compared to $3.18 billion as of December 31, 2015. \n \u2022 Deposits were $3.81 billion at December 31, 2016 compared to $3.51 billion at December 31, 2015 as noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased $47.7 million, or 4.1 percent, interest-bearing money market and savings accounts increased $457.5 million or 52.5 percent and time deposits decreased $207.7 million, or 15.0 percent. \n \u2022 Cash dividends of $0.66 per share of common stock were declared for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $0.47 and $0.28 per share of common stock for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. \nResults of Operations\nImpact of Acquisitions on Earnings Performance\nThe comparability of financial information was affected by our acquisition of CBI on August 31, 2014 ($1.27 billion in assets). The transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and accordingly, the related operating results have been included in the consolidated financial statements from the respective acquisition date. We also acquired an equipment leasing portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2016. However, due to the size and timing of the 2016 transaction, the comparability of financial information was not significantly impacted by such transaction. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2 - Acquisitions.\u201d\nNet Interest Income\nOur primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is the difference between interest and fees derived from earning assets, and interest paid on liabilities obtained to fund those assets. Our net interest income is affected by changes in the level and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as volume changes. Net interest income is also affected by changes in the yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities, referred to as rate changes. Interest rates charged on loans and leases are affected principally by changes to interest rates, the demand for such loans and leases, the supply of money available for lending purposes, and other competitive factors. Those factors are, in turn, affected by general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control, such as federal economic policies, the general supply of money in the economy, legislative tax policies, governmental budgetary matters, and the actions of the Federal Reserve.\nThe following table shows the average balances of assets, liabilities and stockholders' equity; the amount of interest income, on a tax equivalent basis and interest expense; the average yield or rate for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; and the net interest spread and the net interest margin for the periods indicated. All average balances are daily average balances.\n\n \n (1) Loans and leases include LHFS and exclude the allowance for loan and lease losses. Nonaccrual loans and leases are included in the average loan and lease balance. \n (2) Amounts calculated on a fully equivalent basis using the current statutory federal tax rate \n (3) 2016 and 2015 income include special dividend of $559,000 and $605,000 from FHLB of San Francisco, respectively. \n (4) Represents interest expense on deposits as a percentage of all interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits. \n (5) Represents the average yield earned on interest-earning assets less the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. \n (6) Represents net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. \nThe table below shows changes in interest income and interest expense and the amounts attributable to variations in interest rates and volumes for the periods indicated. The variances attributable to simultaneous volume and rate changes have been allocated to the change due to volume and the change due to rate categories in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amount attributable solely to the change in volume and to the change in rate.\n\n \n (1) Includes loans held for sale \n (2) Amounts calculated on a fully equivalent basis using the current statutory federal tax rate  2016 Compared to 2015\nInterest income, on a taxable equivalent basis, increased $15.9 million, or 9.7 percent, to $180.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $164.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest expense increased $2.2 million or 13.4 percent, to $18.3 million in 2016 from $16.1 million in 2015. Net interest income, on a taxable equivalent basis, was $162.2 million and $148.5 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in net interest income was primarily attributable to the growth in average loans and leases and the higher percentage of loans and leases in the mix of interest-earning assets. Average loans and leases were 83.4 percent of average interest earning assets for 2016, up from 76.2 percent for 2015. The net interest spread and net interest margin, on a taxable equivalent basis, for the year ended December 31, 2016 were 3.71 percent and 3.95 percent, respectively, compared with 3.67 percent and 3.90 percent, respectively, for the same period in 2015. Excluding the effects of acquisition accounting adjustments, net interest margin was 3.79 percent and 3.47 percent for 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nAverage loans and leases increased $521.6 million, or 18.0 percent, to $3.42 billion in 2016 from $2.90 billion in 2015. Average securities decreased $173.4 million, or 22.0 percent, to $614.7 million in 2016 from $788.2 million in 2015. Average interest earning assets increased $298.1 million, or 7.8 percent, to $4.10 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $3.81 billion for the same period in 2015. The increase in average loans and leases was due mainly to new loan production. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $147.4 million, or 5.9 percent, to $2.64 billion in 2016 compared to $2.49 billion in 2015. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities resulted primarily from an increase in FHLB advances and growth in money market and savings deposits, offset by a decrease in average time deposits.\nThe average yield on loans and leases decreased to 4.81 percent for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 5.13 percent in 2015, primarily due to lower loan and lease yields and a decrease in discount accretion on purchased loans and leases. The average yield on securities, on a taxable equivalent basis, increased to 2.15 percent in 2016 from 1.62 in 2015, attributable primarily to increases in balances and yields on mortgage-backed securities. The average yield on interest-earning assets, on a\ntaxable equivalent basis, increased 8 basis points to 4.40 percent in 2016 from 4.32 percent in 2015, due mainly to the higher percentage of loans and leases in the mix of interest-earning assets. The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased by 4 basis points to 0.69 percent in 2016 from 0.65 percent in 2015. The increase was due to increases in the cost of deposits and borrowings.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, net interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, was $148.5 million and $122.8 million, respectively. The increase in net interest income in 2015 as compared to 2014, was due mainly to the 18.9 percent increase in average loans and leases. In addition, the net accretion of discount on loans and leases and interest-bearing liabilities acquired in the CBI Acquisition was $16.5 million and $7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The net interest spread and net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 were 3.67 percent and 3.90 percent, respectively, as compared to 3.65 percent and 3.88 percent, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014. Excluding the effects of acquisition accounting adjustments, the net interest margin was 3.47 and 3.65 percent for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nAverage loans and leases were $2.90 billion in 2015 as compared with $2.44 billion in 2014, representing an increase of 18.9 percent. Average securities were $788.2 million in 2015 as compared with $648.9 million in 2014, representing an increase of 21.5 percent. Average interest-earning assets increased to $3.81 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared with $3.16 billion in 2014, representing an increase of 20.3 percent. The increase in average interest-earning assets was due mainly to the growth in loans and leases. Average interest-bearing liabilities were $2.49 billion in 2015 as compared to $2.05 billion in 2014, representing an increase of 21.4 percent. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities in 2015 was due primarily to the growth in deposits.\nThe average yield on loans and leases increased by 12 basis points to 5.13 percent in 2015 from 5.01 percent in 2014. The increase reflects the full-year effects of purchase accounting. Absent the effects of purchase accounting, loan and lease yields declined in 2015 and 2014 reflecting the low interest rate environment and higher level of competition. The average yield on interest-earning assets decreased by 1 basis point to 4.32 percent in 2015 from 4.33 percent in 2014. The average cost on interest-bearing liabilities decreased by 3 basis points to 0.65 percent in 2015 from 0.68 percent in 2014.\nProvision for Loan and Lease Losses\nIn anticipation of credit risks inherent in our lending business, we set aside an allowance for loan and lease losses through charges to earnings. These charges are made not only for our outstanding loan and lease portfolio, but also for off-balance sheet items, such as commitments to extend credit, or letters of credit. The charges made for our outstanding loan and lease portfolio are recorded to the allowance for loan and lease losses, whereas charges for off-balance sheet items are recorded to the reserve for off-balance sheet items, and are presented as a component of other liabilities.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nMost credit metrics continue to improve as the overall quality of the loan and lease portfolio improved in 2016. Therefore, a negative loan and lease loss provision of $4.3 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016, which included a $0.7 million provision for losses on PCI loans, compared to a negative loan and lease loss provision of $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which included a $4.4 million provision for losses on PCI loans. The charge to other noninterest expense for losses on off-balance sheet items was $0.2 million in 2016 compared to a credit of $0.4 million for the same period in 2015.\nNet loan and lease charge-offs were $6.2 million, or 0.18 percent of average loans and leases, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to net recoveries of $1.9 million, or 0.06 percent of average loans and leases, for the year ended December 31, 2015. The charge-offs in 2016 included $5.1 million of PCI loans net charge-offs compared to no PCI loans charge-offs or recoveries in 2015.\nClassified loans and leases (excluding PCI loans) decreased by $9.0 million, or 23.1 percent, to $30.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $39.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nAll other credit metrics also experienced improvements as the quality of the loan and lease portfolio improved in 2015. Therefore, a negative loan and lease loss provision of $11.6 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015, which included a $4.4 million provision for losses on PCI loans, compared to a negative loan and lease loss provision of $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which included a $1.0 million provision for losses on PCI loans.\nNet loan and lease recoveries were $1.9 million, or 0.06 percent of average loans and leases, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1.4 million, or 0.06 percent of average loans and leases, for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nClassified loans and leases (excluding PCI loans) decreased by $8.1 million, or 17.1 percent, to $39.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $47.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nSee Nonperforming Assets\u201d and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Allowance for Off-Balance Sheet Items\u201d for further details.\nNoninterest Income\nThe following table sets forth the various components of non-interest income for the years indicated:\n\n2016 Compared to 2015\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, noninterest income was $33.1 million, a decrease of $14.5 million, or 30.5 percent, compared with $47.6 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower securities transactions and lower gains from the resolution or disposition of PCI loans. Sales of securities resulted in a net gain of $46,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with gains of $6.6 million in 2015. When a PCI loan is removed from a loan pool and the cash proceeds or assets received from the settlement of the loan are in excess of its carrying amount, we recognize such gains as disposition gains. Disposition gains on PCI loans were $5.0 million in 2016 compared with $10.2 million in 2015 as PCI loans declined $10.2 million in 2016 compared with $24.5 million decline in 2015. The increase in other operating income included a $1.0 million gain on sale of a branch facility during the third quarter of 2016.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, noninterest income was $47.6 million, an increase of $5.3 million, or 12.5 percent, from $42.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to higher gains on dispositions of PCI loans, securities transactions and SBA loan sales, offset by the absence of the 2014 $14.6 million after-tax bargain purchase gain. Service charges, fees and other income for the year ended December 31, 2015, was up 6.2 percent to $22.1 million from $20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Gains on sales of SBA loans were $8.7 million, compared to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in gains on SBA loans primarily relates to an increase in SBA loans sold to $89.1 million in 2015 from $42.4 million in 2014. Disposition gains on PCI loans were $10.2 million in 2015. PCI loans were $20.0 million at December 31, 2015, down $24.5 million or 55.0 percent, from $44.5 million at December 31, 2014.\nNoninterest Expense\nThe following table sets forth the breakdown of noninterest expense for the years indicated: \n2016 Compared to 2015\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, noninterest expense was $108.2 million, a decrease of $7.1 million or 6.2 percent, compared with $115.3 in 2015. The decrease was due primarily to reductions in merger and integration costs, professional fees and data processing fees related to the CBI Acquisition, along with lower occupancy and equipment expense from the branch closures and consolidations completed in the third quarter 2015.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, noninterest expense was $115.3 million, an increase of $16.7 million or 16.9 percent, compared to $98.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was due primarily to the full impact of the August 2014 acquisition. The largest component of noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was salaries and employee benefits, which represented 54.5 percent of total noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015. Salaries and employee benefits increased $12.7 million, or 25.3 percent, to $62.9 million, compared to $50.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, due mainly to the increase in personnel arising from the acquisition.\nIncome Tax Expense\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, provision for income taxes were $32.9 million, $38.2 million and $22.9 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was 36.8 percent, 41.5 percent and 31.5 percent, respectively. The lower effective tax rate in 2016 included a $1.8 million benefit arising from the finalization of the 2014 amended income tax returns. The higher effective tax rate for 2015 reflects a higher level of state taxes and the lower effective tax rate for 2014 reflects the impact of the $14.6 million after-tax bargain purchase gain recognized in 2014.\nIncome taxes are discussed in more detail in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 12 - Income Taxes\u201d presented elsewhere herein.\nFinancial Condition\nSecurities Portfolio\nSecurities are classified as held to maturity, available for sale, or trading in accordance with GAAP. Those securities that we have the ability and the intent to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity.\u201d All other securities are classified either as available for sale\u201d or trading.\u201d There were no held to maturity or trading securities as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. Securities classified as held to maturity are stated at cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and available for sale and trading securities are stated at fair value. The composition of our securities portfolio reflects our investment strategy of providing a relatively stable source of interest income while maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity. Our securities portfolio also provides a source of liquidity by pledging as collateral or through repurchase agreement and collateral for certain public funds deposits.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our securities portfolio was composed primarily of U.S. government mortgage-backed securities, municipal securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. Most of the securities carried fixed interest rates. Other than holdings of U.S. government agency securities, there were no securities of any one issuer exceeding 10 percent of stockholders' equity as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nThe following table summarizes the amortized cost, fair value and distribution of securities as of the dates indicated: \n \n (1) Collateralized by residential mortgages and guaranteed by U.S. government sponsored entities. \n (2) A portion of the mortgage-backed securities is comprised of home mortgage-backed securities backed by home equity conversion mortgages  As of December 31, 2016, securities available for sale decreased 26.0 percent to $517.0 million, compared to $698.3 billion as of December 31, 2015, primarily to fund loan growth. As of December 31, 2016, securities available for sale had a net unrealized loss of $4.1 million, comprised of $1.2 million of unrealized gains and $5.3 million of unrealized losses. As of December 31, 2015, securities available for sale had a net unrealized loss of $2.3 million, comprised of $2.5 million of unrealized gains and $4.8 million of unrealized losses.\nThe following table summarizes the contractual maturity schedule for securities, at amortized cost, and their weighted-average yield as of December 31, 2016:\n\n \n (1) The yield on municipal bonds has been computed on a federal tax-equivalent basis of 35%  Loan and Lease Portfolio\nReal estate loans are secured by commercial or residential properties for the purpose of financing a purchase, refinancing debt, or making building improvements. These loans are either owner-occupied or non-owner occupied. The Bank originates these loans using underwriting guidelines which include minimum debt service ability, maximum loan to values, and analyzing the borrower's future capacity to repay the loan.\nCommercial and industrial loans are extended to businesses on a term or line of credit basis. The Bank provides commercial term loans for the purposes of purchasing business, equipment, leasehold improvements or working capital, with maturities ranging from three to seven years. The Bank also provides commercial lines of credit for the purposes of short term working capital, financing trading assets, or import and export financing. These lines of credit usually have maturities of one year.\nLeases receivable include equipment finance agreements with terms ranging from 1 to 7 years. Equipment leases are similar to commercial business loans in that the leases are typically made on the basis of the borrower's ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower's business.\nThe following sets forth the amount of total loans and leases outstanding in each category as of the dates indicated, excluding loans held for sales:\n\n \n (1) Includes, among other property types, mixed-use, apartment, office, industrial, faith-based facilities and warehouse; the remaining real estate categories represents less than one percent of the Bank's total loans and leases. \n (2) Consumer loans include home equity lines of credit. \n.As of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, loans and leases receivable (excluding loans held for sale), net of deferred loan costs, discounts and allowance for loan and lease losses, totaled $3.81 billion, $3.14 billion and $2.74 billion, respectively, representing an increase of $672.0 million or 21.4 percent in 2016, and $404.6 million, or 14.8 percent in 2015. The $672.0 million increase in loans and leases in 2016 was attributable primarily to a $10.5 million decrease in the allowance for loan and lease losses and a $661.5 million, or 20.8 percent net increase in loans and leases which includes the $228.2 million acquisition of an equipment lease portfolio.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, total loan and lease disbursements consisted of $619.4 million in commercial real estate loans, $131.6 million in SBA loans, $81.8 million in commercial and industrial loans, and $398.3 million for loan and lease purchases. The increase was offset by $92.6 million of transfers to loans held for sale and $504.3 million of pay-offs and other net reductions.\nThe following table sets forth the percentage distribution of loans and leases in each category as of the dates indicated: \nThe table below shows the maturity distribution of outstanding loans and leases as of December 31, 2016. In addition, the table shows the distribution of such loans and leases between those with floating or variable interest rates and those with fixed or predetermined interest rates. The table includes nonaccrual, non-PCI loans and leases of $11.4 million. ", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis discussion presents management's analysis of the financial condition and results of operations as of and for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes related thereto presented elsewhere in this Report. See also Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe have established various accounting policies that govern the application of GAAP in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses. Our financial position and results of operations can be materially affected by these estimates and assumptions. Critical accounting policies are those policies that are most important to the determination of our financial condition and results of operations or that require management to make assumptions and estimates that are subjective or complex. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d Management believes that the following policies are critical.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Allowance for Off-Balance Sheet Items\nOur allowance for loan and lease losses methodologies incorporate a variety of risk considerations, both quantitative and qualitative, in establishing an allowance for loan and lease losses that management believes is appropriate at each reporting date. Quantitative factors include our historical loss experiences on segmented loan pools by type and risk rating, delinquency and charge-off trends, collateral values, changes in nonperforming loans and leases, and other factors. Qualitative factors include the general economic environment in our markets, delinquency and charge-off trends, and the change in nonperforming loans and leases. Concentration of credit, change of lending management and staff, quality of the loan and lease review system, and changes in interest rates are other qualitative factors that are considered in our methodologies. See Financial Condition - Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Allowance for Off-Balance Sheet Items,\u201d Results of Operations - Provision for Credit Losses\u201d and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d for additional information on methodologies used to determine the allowance for loan and lease losses and the allowance for off-balance sheet items.\nLoan Sales\nThe guaranteed portions of certain SBA loans are normally sold to secondary market investors. When SBA loans are sold, we generally retain the right to service the loans. We record a loan servicing asset when the benefits of servicing are expected to be more than adequate compensation to a servicer, which is determined by discounting all of the future net cash flows associated with the contractual rights and obligations of the servicing agreement. The expected future net cash flows are discounted at a rate equal to the return that would adequately compensate a substitute servicer for performing the servicing. In addition to the anticipated rate of loan prepayments and discount rates, other assumptions (such as the cost to service the underlying loans, foreclosure costs, ancillary income and float rates) are also used in determining the value of the loan servicing assets. Loan servicing assets are discussed in more detail in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 6 - Servicing Assets and Liabilities\u201d presented elsewhere herein.\nPurchased Credit Impaired Loans\nPurchased credit impaired ( PCI\u201d) loans are accounted for in accordance with ASC Subtopic 310-30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality.\u201d A purchased loan is deemed to be credit impaired when there is evidence of credit deterioration since its origination and it is probable at the acquisition date that we would be unable to collect all contractually required payments. We apply PCI loan accounting when (i) we acquire loans deemed to be impaired, and (ii) as a general policy election for non-impaired loans that we acquire in a distressed bank acquisition.\nFor PCI loans, at the time of acquisition we (i) calculated the contractual amount and timing of undiscounted principal and interest payments (the undiscounted contractual cash flows\u201d) and (ii) estimated the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal and interest payments (the undiscounted expected cash flows\u201d). The difference between the undiscounted contractual cash flows and the undiscounted expected cash flows is the nonaccretable difference. The nonaccretable difference represents an estimate of the loss exposure of principal and interest related to the PCI loan portfolios; such amount is subject to change over time based on the performance of such loans. The carrying value of PCI loans is reduced by payments received, both principal and interest, and increased by the portion of the accretable yield recognized as interest income.\nThe excess of expected cash flows at acquisition over the initial fair value of acquired impaired loans is referred to as the accretable yield\u201d and is recorded as interest income over the estimated life of the loans using the effective yield. If estimated cash flows are indeterminable, the recognition of interest income will cease to be recognized.\nAs part of the fair value process and the subsequent accounting, the Company aggregates PCI loans into pools having common credit risk characteristics such as product type, geographic location and risk rating. Increases in expected cash flows over those previously estimated increase the accretable yield and are recognized as interest income prospectively. Decreases in the amount and changes in the timing of expected cash flows compared to those previously estimated decrease the accretable yield and usually result in a provision for loan losses and the establishment of an allowance for loan losses. As the accretable yield increases or decreases from changes in cash flow expectations, the offset is a decrease or increase to the nonaccretable difference. The accretable yield is measured at each financial reporting date based on information then currently available and represents the difference between the remaining undiscounted expected cash flows and the current carrying value of the loans. In addition, the Company removes loans from loan pools when the Company receives payment in settlement with the borrower, sells the loan, or foreclose upon the collateral securing the loan. The Company recognizes \"Disposition gain on Purchased Credit Impaired Loans\" when the cash proceeds or the amount received are in excess of the loan's carrying amount. The removal of the loan from the loan pool and the recognition of disposition gains do not affect the then applicable loan pool accretable yield.\nBelow is a summary of acquired purchased credit impaired loans as of the acquisition date, August 31, 2014 and December 31, 2016.\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

there is an expectation that the estimated cash flows will be received. If the timing and amount of cash flows is not reasonably estimable, the loans may be classified as nonaccrual with interest income recognized on either a cash basis or as a reduction of the principal amount outstanding.\nSecurities\nThe classification and accounting for securities are discussed in more detail in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 5 - Securities\u201d presented elsewhere herein. Under FASB ASC 320, Investments,\u201d securities generally must be classified as held to maturity, available for sale or trading. The appropriate classification is based partially on our ability to hold the securities to maturity and largely on management's\nintentions with respect to either holding or selling the securities. The classification of securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities. Unrealized gains and losses on trading securities flow directly through earnings during the periods in which they arise. Securities that are classified as held to maturity are recorded at amortized cost. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are recorded as a separate component of stockholders' equity (accumulated other comprehensive income or loss) and do not affect earnings until realized or are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired.\nThe fair values of securities are generally determined by quoted market prices obtained from independent external brokers or independent external pricing service providers who have experience in valuing these securities. In obtaining such valuation information from third parties, we have evaluated the methodologies used to develop the resulting fair values. We perform a monthly review of alternative pricing received from third parties to ensure that the prices represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value. The procedures include, but are not limited to, initial and on-going review of third party pricing methodologies, review of pricing trends, and monitoring of trading volumes.\nWe review securities on an ongoing basis for the presence of other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) or permanent impairment, taking into consideration current market conditions, fair value in relationship to cost, extent and nature of the change in fair value, issuer rating changes and trends, whether we intend to sell a security or if it is likely that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost basis of the investment, which may be maturity, and other factors.\nFor debt securities, the classification of OTTI depends on whether we intend to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its costs basis, and on the nature of the impairment. If we intend to sell a security or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, an OTTI write-down is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the security's amortized cost basis and its fair value. If we do not intend to sell the security or it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, the OTTI write-down is separated into an amount representing credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and the amount related to all other factors, which is recognized in other comprehensive income net of tax. A credit loss is the difference between the cost basis of the security and the present value of cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the security's effective interest rate at the date of acquisition. The cost basis of an other than temporarily impaired security is written down by the amount of impairment recognized in earnings. The new cost basis is not adjusted for subsequent recoveries in fair value.\nManagement does not believe that there are any securities that are deemed OTTI as of December 31, 2016.\nIncome Taxes\nIn accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 740, the Company periodically reviews its income tax positions based on tax laws and regulations and financial reporting considerations, and records adjustments as appropriate. This review takes into consideration the status of current taxing authorities' examinations of the Company's tax returns, recent positions taken by the taxing authorities on similar transactions, if any, and the overall tax environment.\nAs of each reporting date, management considers the realization of deferred tax assets based on management's judgment of various future events and uncertainties, including the timing and amount of future income, as well as the implementation of various tax planning strategies to maximize realization of deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of December 31, 2016, management determined that a valuation allowance of $1.0 million was appropriate against certain state net operating losses. For all other deferred tax assets, management believes it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized principally through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. Management further believes that future taxable income will be sufficient to realize the benefits of temporary deductible differences that cannot be realized through carry-back to prior years or through the reversal of future temporary taxable differences.\nIncome taxes are discussed in more detail in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 12 - Income Taxes\u201d presented elsewhere herein.\nExecutive Overview\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, net income was $56.5 million, $53.8 million and $49.8 million, respectively. The increase in net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was due mainly to the increase in net interest income by 8.2 percent or $12.1 million, primarily because of an increase in loans and leases receivable, a decrease in income tax expense and lower noninterest expense, offset by the impact of lower gain on sales of securities, disposition gains on PCI loans and lower negative provision for loan and lease losses.\nThe increase in net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was due mainly to the growth in net interest income from the 20 percent increase in average interest-earning assets, higher levels of SBA loan sales and their related gains, and higher amounts of disposition gains on PCI loans and securities, reduced by increased amounts of noninterest expenses reflecting the CBI Acquisition.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our earnings per diluted share were $1.75, $1.68 and $1.56, respectively.\nSignificant financial highlights include:\n \u2022 With new loan growth and the acquisition of the equipment leasing portfolio, loans and leases receivable increased by $661.5 million, or 20.8 percent, to $3.84 billion as of December 31, 2016, compared to $3.18 billion as of December 31, 2015. \n \u2022 Deposits were $3.81 billion at December 31, 2016 compared to $3.51 billion at December 31, 2015 as noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased $47.7 million, or 4.1 percent, interest-bearing money market and savings accounts increased $457.5 million or 52.5 percent and time deposits decreased $207.7 million, or 15.0 percent. \n \u2022 Cash dividends of $0.66 per share of common stock were declared for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $0.47 and $0.28 per share of common stock for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. \nResults of Operations\nImpact of Acquisitions on Earnings Performance\nThe comparability of financial information was affected by our acquisition of CBI on August 31, 2014 ($1.27 billion in assets). The transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and accordingly, the related operating results have been included in the consolidated financial statements from the respective acquisition date. We also acquired an equipment leasing portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2016. However, due to the size and timing of the 2016 transaction, the comparability of financial information was not significantly impacted by such transaction. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2 - Acquisitions.\u201d\nNet Interest Income\nOur primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is the difference between interest and fees derived from earning assets, and interest paid on liabilities obtained to fund those assets. Our net interest income is affected by changes in the level and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as volume changes. Net interest income is also affected by changes in the yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities, referred to as rate changes. Interest rates charged on loans and leases are affected principally by changes to interest rates, the demand for such loans and leases, the supply of money available for lending purposes, and other competitive factors. Those factors are, in turn, affected by general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control, such as federal economic policies, the general supply of money in the economy, legislative tax policies, governmental budgetary matters, and the actions of the Federal Reserve.\nThe following table shows the average balances of assets, liabilities and stockholders' equity; the amount of interest income, on a tax equivalent basis and interest expense; the average yield or rate for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; and the net interest spread and the net interest margin for the periods indicated. All average balances are daily average balances.\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

taxable equivalent basis, increased $15.9 million, or 9.7 percent, to $180.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $164.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest expense increased $2.2 million or 13.4 percent, to $18.3 million in 2016 from $16.1 million in 2015. Net interest income, on a taxable equivalent basis, was $162.2 million and $148.5 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in net interest income was primarily attributable to the growth in average loans and leases and the higher percentage of loans and leases in the mix of interest-earning assets. Average loans and leases were 83.4 percent of average interest earning assets for 2016, up from 76.2 percent for 2015. The net interest spread and net interest margin, on a taxable equivalent basis, for the year ended December 31, 2016 were 3.71 percent and 3.95 percent, respectively, compared with 3.67 percent and 3.90 percent, respectively, for the same period in 2015. Excluding the effects of acquisition accounting adjustments, net interest margin was 3.79 percent and 3.47 percent for 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nAverage loans and leases increased $521.6 million, or 18.0 percent, to $3.42 billion in 2016 from $2.90 billion in 2015. Average securities decreased $173.4 million, or 22.0 percent, to $614.7 million in 2016 from $788.2 million in 2015. Average interest earning assets increased $298.1 million, or 7.8 percent, to $4.10 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $3.81 billion for the same period in 2015. The increase in average loans and leases was due mainly to new loan production. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $147.4 million, or 5.9 percent, to $2.64 billion in 2016 compared to $2.49 billion in 2015. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities resulted primarily from an increase in FHLB advances and growth in money market and savings deposits, offset by a decrease in average time deposits.\nThe average yield on loans and leases decreased to 4.81 percent for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 5.13 percent in 2015, primarily due to lower loan and lease yields and a decrease in discount accretion on purchased loans and leases. The average yield on securities, on a taxable equivalent basis, increased to 2.15 percent in 2016 from 1.62 in 2015, attributable primarily to increases in balances and yields on mortgage-backed securities. The average yield on interest-earning assets, on a\ntaxable equivalent basis, increased 8 basis points to 4.40 percent in 2016 from 4.32 percent in 2015, due mainly to the higher percentage of loans and leases in the mix of interest-earning assets. The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased by 4 basis points to 0.69 percent in 2016 from 0.65 percent in 2015. The increase was due to increases in the cost of deposits and borrowings.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, net interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, was $148.5 million and $122.8 million, respectively. The increase in net interest income in 2015 as compared to 2014, was due mainly to the 18.9 percent increase in average loans and leases. In addition, the net accretion of discount on loans and leases and interest-bearing liabilities acquired in the CBI Acquisition was $16.5 million and $7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The net interest spread and net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 were 3.67 percent and 3.90 percent, respectively, as compared to 3.65 percent and 3.88 percent, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014. Excluding the effects of acquisition accounting adjustments, the net interest margin was 3.47 and 3.65 percent for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nAverage loans and leases were $2.90 billion in 2015 as compared with $2.44 billion in 2014, representing an increase of 18.9 percent. Average securities were $788.2 million in 2015 as compared with $648.9 million in 2014, representing an increase of 21.5 percent. Average interest-earning assets increased to $3.81 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared with $3.16 billion in 2014, representing an increase of 20.3 percent. The increase in average interest-earning assets was due mainly to the growth in loans and leases. Average interest-bearing liabilities were $2.49 billion in 2015 as compared to $2.05 billion in 2014, representing an increase of 21.4 percent. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities in 2015 was due primarily to the growth in deposits.\nThe average yield on loans and leases increased by 12 basis points to 5.13 percent in 2015 from 5.01 percent in 2014. The increase reflects the full-year effects of purchase accounting. Absent the effects of purchase accounting, loan and lease yields declined in 2015 and 2014 reflecting the low interest rate environment and higher level of competition. The average yield on interest-earning assets decreased by 1 basis point to 4.32 percent in 2015 from 4.33 percent in 2014. The average cost on interest-bearing liabilities decreased by 3 basis points to 0.65 percent in 2015 from 0.68 percent in 2014.\nProvision for Loan and Lease Losses\nIn anticipation of credit risks inherent in our lending business, we set aside an allowance for loan and lease losses through charges to earnings. These charges are made not only for our outstanding loan and lease portfolio, but also for off-balance sheet items, such as commitments to extend credit, or letters of credit. The charges made for our outstanding loan and lease portfolio are recorded to the allowance for loan and lease losses, whereas charges for off-balance sheet items are recorded to the reserve for off-balance sheet items, and are presented as a component of other liabilities.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nMost credit metrics continue to improve as the overall quality of the loan and lease portfolio improved in 2016. Therefore, a negative loan and lease loss provision of $4.3 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016, which included a $0.7 million provision for losses on PCI loans, compared to a negative loan and lease loss provision of $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which included a $4.4 million provision for losses on PCI loans. The charge to other noninterest expense for losses on off-balance sheet items was $0.2 million in 2016 compared to a credit of $0.4 million for the same period in 2015.\nNet loan and lease charge-offs were $6.2 million, or 0.18 percent of average loans and leases, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to net recoveries of $1.9 million, or 0.06 percent of average loans and leases, for the year ended December 31, 2015. The charge-offs in 2016 included $5.1 million of PCI loans net charge-offs compared to no PCI loans charge-offs or recoveries in 2015.\nClassified loans and leases (excluding PCI loans) decreased by $9.0 million, or 23.1 percent, to $30.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $39.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nAll other credit metrics also experienced improvements as the quality of the loan and lease portfolio improved in 2015. Therefore, a negative loan and lease loss provision of $11.6 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015, which included a $4.4 million provision for losses on PCI loans, compared to a negative loan and lease loss provision of $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which included a $1.0 million provision for losses on PCI loans.\nNet loan and lease recoveries were $1.9 million, or 0.06 percent of average loans and leases, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1.4 million, or 0.06 percent of average loans and leases, for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nClassified loans and leases (excluding PCI loans) decreased by $8.1 million, or 17.1 percent, to $39.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $47.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nSee Nonperforming Assets\u201d and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Allowance for Off-Balance Sheet Items\u201d for further details.\nNoninterest Income\nThe following table sets forth the various components of non-interest income for the years indicated:\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service charges on deposit accounts\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade finance and other service charges and fees\n</td> <td>4,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating income\n</td> <td>6,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal service charges, fees and other income\n</td> <td>22,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of SBA loans\n</td> <td>6,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Disposition gains on PCI loans\n</td> <td>4,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gain on sales of securities\n</td> <td>46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bargain purchase gain, net of deferred taxes\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total noninterest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 Compared to 2015\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, noninterest income was $33.1 million, a decrease of $14.5 million, or 30.5 percent, compared with $47.6 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower securities transactions and lower gains from the resolution or disposition of PCI loans. Sales of securities resulted in a net gain of $46,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with gains of $6.6 million in 2015. When a PCI loan is removed from a loan pool and the cash proceeds or assets received from the settlement of the loan are in excess of its carrying amount, we recognize such gains as disposition gains. Disposition gains on PCI loans were $5.0 million in 2016 compared with $10.2 million in 2015 as PCI loans declined $10.2 million in 2016 compared with $24.5 million decline in 2015. The increase in other operating income included a $1.0 million gain on sale of a branch facility during the third quarter of 2016.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, noninterest income was $47.6 million, an increase of $5.3 million, or 12.5 percent, from $42.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to higher gains on dispositions of PCI loans, securities transactions and SBA loan sales, offset by the absence of the 2014 $14.6 million after-tax bargain purchase gain. Service charges, fees and other income for the year ended December 31, 2015, was up 6.2 percent to $22.1 million from $20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Gains on sales of SBA loans were $8.7 million, compared to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.

The decrease was due primarily to reductions in merger and integration costs, professional fees and data processing fees related to the CBI Acquisition, along with lower occupancy and equipment expense from the branch closures and consolidations completed in the third quarter 2015.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, noninterest expense was $115.3 million, an increase of $16.7 million or 16.9 percent, compared to $98.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was due primarily to the full impact of the August 2014 acquisition. The largest component of noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was salaries and employee benefits, which represented 54.5 percent of total noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015. Salaries and employee benefits increased $12.7 million, or 25.3 percent, to $62.9 million, compared to $50.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, due mainly to the increase in personnel arising from the acquisition.\nIncome Tax Expense\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, provision for income taxes were $32.9 million, $38.2 million and $22.9 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was 36.8 percent, 41.5 percent and 31.5 percent, respectively. The lower effective tax rate in 2016 included a $1.8 million benefit arising from the finalization of the 2014 amended income tax returns. The higher effective tax rate for 2015 reflects a higher level of state taxes and the lower effective tax rate for 2014 reflects the impact of the $14.6 million after-tax bargain purchase gain recognized in 2014.\nIncome taxes are discussed in more detail in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 12 - Income Taxes\u201d presented elsewhere herein.\nFinancial Condition\nSecurities Portfolio\nSecurities are classified as held to maturity, available for sale, or trading in accordance with GAAP. Those securities that we have the ability and the intent to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity.\u201d All other securities are classified either as available for sale\u201d or trading.\u201d There were no held to maturity or trading securities as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. Securities classified as held to maturity are stated at cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and available for sale and trading securities are stated at fair value. The composition of our securities portfolio reflects our investment strategy of providing a relatively stable source of interest income while maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity. Our securities portfolio also provides a source of liquidity by pledging as collateral or through repurchase agreement and collateral for certain public funds deposits.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our securities portfolio was composed primarily of U.S. government mortgage-backed securities, municipal securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. Most of the securities carried fixed interest rates. Other than holdings of U.S. government agency securities, there were no securities of any one issuer exceeding 10 percent of stockholders' equity as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nThe following

Loan and Lease Portfolio\nReal estate loans are secured by commercial or residential properties for the purpose of financing a purchase, refinancing debt, or making building improvements. These loans are either owner-occupied or non-owner occupied. The Bank originates these loans using underwriting guidelines which include minimum debt service ability, maximum loan to values, and analyzing the borrower's future capacity to repay the loan.\nCommercial and industrial loans are extended to businesses on a term or line of credit basis. The Bank provides commercial term loans for the purposes of purchasing business, equipment, leasehold improvements or working capital, with maturities ranging from three to seven years. The Bank also provides commercial lines of credit for the purposes of short term working capital, financing trading assets, or import and export financing. These lines of credit usually have maturities of one year.\nLeases receivable include equipment finance agreements with terms ranging from 1 to 7 years. Equipment leases are similar to commercial business loans in that the leases are typically made on the basis of the borrower's ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower's business.\nThe following sets forth the amount of total loans and leases outstanding in each category as of the dates indicated, excluding loans held for sales:\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate loans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial property\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>859,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>740,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>684,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hotel/motel\n</td> <td>651,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>543,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>462,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gas station\n</td> <td>262,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>323,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>370,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (1)\n</td> <td>1,109,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>978,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>848,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction\n</td> <td>55,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential property\n</td> <td>338,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>236,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total real estate loans\n</td> <td>3,278,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,845,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,511,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial and industrial loans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial term\n</td> <td>138,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>152,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial lines of credit\n</td> <td>136,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International loans\n</td> <td>25,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total commercial and industrial loans\n</td> <td>300,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>312,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>249,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leases receivable\n</td> <td>243,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer loans (2)\n</td> <td>22,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans and leases receivable\n</td> <td>3,844,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,183,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,788,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for loans and lease losses\n</td> <td>(32,429\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(42,935\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(52,666\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans and leases receivable, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,812,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,140,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,735,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n (1) Includes, among other property types, mixed-use, apartment, office, industrial, faith-based facilities and warehouse; the remaining real estate categories represents less than one percent of the Bank's total loans and leases. \n (2) Consumer loans include home equity lines of credit. \n.As of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, loans and leases receivable (excluding loans held for sale), net of deferred loan costs, discounts and allowance for loan and lease losses, totaled $3.81 billion, $3.14 billion and $2.74 billion, respectively, representing an increase of $672.0 million or 21.4 percent in 2016, and $404.6 million, or 14.8 percent in 2015. The $672.0 million increase in loans and leases in 2016 was attributable primarily to a $10.5 million decrease in the allowance for loan and lease losses and a $661.5 million, or 20.8 percent net increase in loans and leases which includes the $228.2 million acquisition of an equipment lease portfolio.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, total loan and lease disbursements consisted of $619.4 million in commercial real estate loans, $131.6 million in SBA loans, $81.8 million in commercial and industrial loans, and $398.3 million for loan and lease purchases. The increase was offset by $92.6 million of transfers to loans held for sale and $504.3 million of pay-offs and other net reductions.\nThe following table sets forth the percentage distribution of loans and leases in each category as of the dates indicated: Table 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate loans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial property\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail\n</td> <td>22.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hotel/motel\n</td> <td>16.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gas station\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>28.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential property\n</td> <td>8.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total real estate loans\n</td> <td>85.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial and industrial loans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial term\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial lines of credit\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International loans\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total commercial and industrial loans\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leases receivable\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer loans\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans and leases receivable\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below shows the maturity distribution of outstanding loans and leases as of December 31, 2016.
