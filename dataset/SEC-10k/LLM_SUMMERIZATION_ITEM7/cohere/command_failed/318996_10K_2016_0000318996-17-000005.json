MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d The discussion below contains forward-looking statements that are based upon our current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances including those identified in Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d above. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations due to potentially inaccurate assumptions and known or unknown\nrisks and uncertainties. Such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nWe provide a full range of well services to major oil companies, foreign national oil companies and independent oil and natural gas production companies to produce, maintain and enhance the flow of oil and natural gas throughout the life of a well. These services include rig-based and coiled tubing-based well maintenance and workover services, well completion and recompletion services, fluid management services, fishing and rental services and other ancillary oilfield services. Additionally, certain of our rigs are capable of specialty drilling applications. We operate in most major oil and natural gas producing regions of the continental United States, and we have operations in Russia, which we are attempting to sell. In addition, we have a technology development and control systems business based in Canada.\nThe demand for our services fluctuates, primarily in relation to the price (or anticipated price) of oil and natural gas, which, in turn, is driven primarily by the supply of, and demand for, oil and natural gas. Generally, as supply of those commodities decreases and demand increases, service and maintenance requirements increase as oil and natural gas producers attempt to maximize the productivity of their wells in a higher priced environment. However, in the lower oil and natural gas price environment that has persisted since late 2014, demand for service and maintenance has decreased as oil and natural gas producers decrease their activity. In particular, the demand for new or existing field drilling and completion work is driven by available investment capital for such work and our customers have significantly curtailed their capital spending in both 2015 and 2016. Because these types of services can be easily started\u201d and stopped,\u201d and oil and natural gas producers generally tend to be less risk tolerant when commodity prices are low or volatile, we may experience a more rapid decline in demand for well maintenance services compared with demand for other types of oilfield services. Further, in a lower-priced environment, fewer well service rigs are needed for completions, as these activities are generally associated with drilling activity.\nEmergence from Voluntary Reorganization and Fresh Start Accounting\nUpon our emergence from bankruptcy on the Effective Date, the Company adopted fresh start accounting which resulted in the creation of a new entity for financial reporting purposes. As a result of the application of fresh start accounting, as well as the effects of the implementation of the Plan, the Consolidated Financial Statements on or after December 16, 2016 are not comparable with the Consolidated Financial Statements prior to that date. Refer to Note 3. Fresh Start Accounting\u201d in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information.\nReferences to Successor\u201d or Successor Company\u201d relate to the financial position and results of operations of the reorganized Company subsequent to December 15, 2016. References to Predecessor\u201d or Predecessor Company\u201d refer to the financial position and results of operations of the Company prior to December 15, 2016.\nBusiness and Growth Strategies\nFocus on Production Related Services\nOver the life of an oil and gas well, regular maintenance of well bore and artificial lift systems is required to maintain production and offset natural production declines. In most of these interventions, a well service rig is required to remove and replace items needing repair, or to perform activities that would increase the oil and gas production from current levels. In many instances these interventions require additional assets or services to perform. With the decline in oil prices beginning in 2014, we believe that a number of oil and gas producers in the United States significantly curtailed their recurring well maintenance activities. We believe that a recovery in oil prices will result in oil and gas producers making the decision to resume regular well maintenance activities. Additionally, we believe that in many instances since the oil price decline began in 2014, oil and gas producers have foregone regular maintenance activities, and that additional demand for our services will be provided by oil and gas producers seeking to improve their production by repairing their wells. Key is well positioned to capitalize on these trends through its fleet of active and warm stacked well service rigs and the additional fishing and rental service offerings it provides and we will continue to invest, either in equipment or through acquisition to grow and take advantage of this dynamic.\nGrowth in Population of Horizontal Oil and Gas Wells\nSince the revolution of horizontal well drilling and hydraulic fracturing began in the United States, thousands of new horizontal oil wells have been added, many in the period from 2012 to 2014. As the initial production from these wells decline over their first several years of production, and these wells are placed on artificial lift systems to maintain production, we believe that these wells will require periodic maintenance similar to a conventional oil well. In many instances due to the depth and long lateral sections of these wells, a larger well service rig with a higher rated derrick capacity will be needed to do this maintenance. We intend to invest in this portion of our well service rig fleet, and the needed rental equipment and services, either through organic capital deployment or acquisition to capitalize on this trend and the growing population of horizontal wells that have entered or will enter the phase of their life where regular maintenance is required.\nPERFORMANCE MEASURES\nThe Baker Hughes U.S. rig count data, which is publicly available on a weekly basis, is often used as a coincident indicator of overall Exploration and Production ( E&P\u201d) company spending and broader oilfield activity. In assessing overall activity in the U.S. onshore oilfield service industry in which we operate, we believe that the Baker Hughes U.S. land drilling rig count is the best barometer of E&P companies' capital spending and resulting activity levels. Historically, our activity levels have been highly correlated to U.S. onshore capital spending by our E&P company customers as a group.\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year\n</td> <td>WTI Cushing Crude\nOil(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NYMEX Henry Hub\nNatural Gas(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average Baker Hughes\nU.S. Land Drilling Rigs(2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2012\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2013\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97.98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.73\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2014\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48.66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>943\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>486\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Represents the average of the monthly average prices for each of the years presented.

Generally, as capital spending by E&P companies increases, demand for our services also rises, resulting in increased rig and trucking services and more hours worked. Conversely, when activity levels decline due to lower spending by E&P companies, we generally provide fewer rig and trucking services, which results in lower hours worked.

Industry conditions are influenced by numerous factors, such as oil and natural gas prices, the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, domestic and worldwide economic conditions, and political instability in oil producing countries. Oil and natural gas prices began a rapid and substantial decline in the fourth quarter of 2014. Depressed commodity price conditions\npersisted and worsened during 2015 and that trend continued into 2016. As a result, the rig count and demand for our products and services declined substantially, and the prices we are able to charge our customers for our products and services have also declined substantially. While we have sought to anticipate activity declines and have reshaped our organizational and cost structure to mitigate the negative impact of these declines, we have continued to experience negative operating results and cash flows from operations. Although oil prices have improved off the low point of 2016, and our revenues improved in the fourth quarter of 2016 over the third quarter of 2016, we have not experienced an uptick in activity levels commensurate with increases in oil prices. The November 2016 decision by OPEC to curtail the cartel's oil production has provided for continued improvement in oil prices and in the future outlook for oil prices and thus improvement in the spending outlook for our customers. We believe that with this improved outlook and increased spending by our customers, demand for our services will continue to improve, allowing for increases in both activity and the price of our services over 2017. With increased demand for oilfield services broadly, however, the demand for qualified employees will also increase, which may impact our ability to meet the needs of our customers or to offset inflation in labor costs with price increases from our customers.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following tables set forth consolidated results of operations and financial information by operating segment and other selected information for the periods indicated. The period from December 16 to December 31, 2016 (Successor Company) and the period from January 1 to December 15, 2016 (Predecessor Company) are distinct reporting periods as a result of our emergence from bankruptcy on December 15, 2016. References in these results of operations to the change and the percentage change combine the Successor Company and Predecessor Company results for the year ended December 31, 2016 in order to provide some comparability of such information to the year ended December 31, 2015. While this combined presentation is not presented according to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d) and no comparable GAAP measure are presented, management believes that providing this financial information is the most relevant and useful method for making comparisons to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Successor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Predecessor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(a) + (b) - (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Period from December 16, 2016 through December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Period from January 1, 2016 through December 15, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>REVENUES\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>399,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>792,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(375,073\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(47\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>COSTS AND EXPENSES:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expenses\n</td> <td>16,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>362,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>714,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(335,209\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(47\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization expense\n</td> <td>3,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>131,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>180,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(45,401\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>6,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>202,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32,873\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment expense\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>722,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(677,450\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(94\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss\n</td> <td>(8,848\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(302,601\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,027,309\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>715,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(70\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reorganization items, net\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(245,571\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(245,571\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized\n</td> <td>1,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (income) loss, net\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,443\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,805\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(126\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>(10,244\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(128,907\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,110,550\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>971,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(87\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,829\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(195,678\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(101\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NET LOSS\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,244\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(131,736\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(917,701\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>775,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(85\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYears Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nRevenues\nOur revenues for the combined year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $375.1 million, or 47.3%, to $417.3 million from $792.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, due to lower spending from our customers as a result of lower oil prices. These market conditions resulted in reduced customer activity and a reduction in the price received for our services. Internationally, we had lower revenue as a result of reduced customer activity in Russia and Colombia and the exit of operations in the Middle East and South America. See Segment Operating Results - Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\u201d below for a more detailed discussion of the change in our revenues.\nDirect operating expenses\nOur direct operating expenses decreased $335.2 million, or 46.9%, to $379.4 million (90.9% of revenues) for the combined year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $714.6 million (90.2% of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease is primarily related to a decrease in employee compensation costs, fuel expense and repair and maintenance expense as we sought to reduce our cost structure and as a result of lower activity levels. See Segment Operating Results - Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\u201d below for a more detailed discussion of the change in our direct operating expenses.\nDepreciation and amortization expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $45.4 million, or 25.2%, to $134.9 million (32.3% of revenues) for the combined year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $180.3 million (22.8% of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to the impairment of certain fixed assets in 2015 and decreases in capital expenditures and lower amortization expense due to the impairment of certain intangible assets.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $32.9 million, or 16.2%, to $169.8 million (40.7% of revenues) for the combined year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $202.6 million (25.6% of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease is primarily due to lower employee compensation costs due to reduced staffing levels and reduction in wages and $30.8 million lower expenses related to our FCPA investigations by the DOJ and the SEC, which concluded in April and August 2016, respectively, partially off-set by $25.8 million in restructuring fees in 2016.\nImpairment expense\nDuring the combined year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a $44.6 million impairment to reduce the carrying value of assets held for sale to fair market value related to our business unit in Mexico. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a $582.7 million impairment of goodwill, a $51.1 million impairment of fixed assets that are being held and used, a $1.5 million impairment of other intangible assets that are no longer being used, and a $86.8 million impairment of fixed assets to reduce the carrying value of assets held for sale to fair market value.\nReorganization items, net\nReorganization items primarily consist of $578.7 million gain on debt discharge partially offset by $299.6 million loss on fresh start accounting revaluations, $19.2 million write-off of deferred financing costs and debt premiums and discounts, and $15.2 million of professional fees incurred in connection with our emergence from voluntary reorganization.\nInterest expense, net of amounts capitalized\nInterest expense increased $1.8 million to $75.7 million (18.1% of revenues), for the combined year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $73.8 million (9.3% of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is primarily related to increased borrowings and interest rate under the new Term Loan Facility in the combined year ended December 31, 2016 and the write-off of the remaining $0.8 million of unamortized deferred financing costs related to a previously terminated credit facility in the second quarter of 2015.\nOther (income) loss, net\nDuring the combined year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized other income, net, of $2.4 million, compared to other loss, net, of $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. A $7.8 million allowance for the collectibility of our notes receivable related to the sale of our operations in Argentina was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2015. Our foreign exchange loss relates to U.S. dollar-denominated transactions in our foreign locations and fluctuations in exchange rates between local currencies and the U.S. dollar.\nThe table below presents comparative detailed information about combined other loss, net at December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Successor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Predecessor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(a) + (b) - (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Period from December 16, 2016 through December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Period from January 1, 2016 through December 15, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(407\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(159\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(268\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>169\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange loss\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,131\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(75\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for collectibility of notes receivable\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,705\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,041\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,305\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(701\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,443\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11,805\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(126\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome tax (expense) benefit\nOur income tax benefit was zero (0.0% effective rate) on pre-tax loss of $10.2 million and $2.8 million (2.2% effective rate) on pre-tax loss of $128.9 million for the period from December 16, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and for the period from January 1, 2016 through December 15, 2016, respectively, compared to an income tax benefit of $192.8 million (17.4% effective rate) on a pre-tax loss of $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Loss per share was $5.86 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1.16 loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nRevenues\nOur revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased $635.0 million, or 44.5%, to $792.3 million from $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, due to lower spending from our customers as a result of lower oil prices. These market conditions resulted in reduced customer activity and a reduction in the price received for our services. Internationally, we had lower revenue as a result of reduced customer activity in Russia and Colombia and the exit of operations in the Middle East and South America. See Segment Operating Results - Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\u201d below for a more detailed discussion of the change in our revenues.\nDirect operating expenses\nOur direct operating expenses decreased $345.0 million, or 32.6%, to $714.6 million (90.2% of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $1.06 billion (74.2% of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease is primarily related to a decrease in employee compensation costs, fuel expense and repair and maintenance expense as we sought to reduce our cost structure and as a result of lower activity levels. See Segment Operating Results - Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\u201d below for a more detailed discussion of the change in our direct operating expenses.\nDepreciation and amortization expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $20.5 million, or 10.2%, to $180.3 million (22.8% of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $200.7 million (14.1% of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease is primarily attributable to the impairment of certain fixed assets and decreases in capital expenditures and lower amortization expense due to the impairment of certain intangible assets.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $47.0 million, or 18.8%, to $202.6 million (25.6% of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $249.6 million (17.5% of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease is primarily due to lower employee compensation costs due to reduced staffing levels and reduction in wages and $31.6 million related to our FCPA investigations in 2015 compared to $41.1 million in 2014.\nImpairment expense\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a $582.7 million impairment of goodwill, a $51.1 million impairment of fixed assets that are being held and used, a $1.5 million impairment of other intangible assets that are no longer being used, and a $86.8 million impairment of fixed assets to reduce the carrying value of assets held for sale to fair market value. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a $28.7 million impairment of goodwill and tradenames in our Russian business unit which is included in our International reporting segment and a $73.4 million impairment of goodwill and fixed assets at our Fishing and Rental Services segment and a $19.1 million impairment of goodwill at our Coiled Tubing segment.\nInterest expense, net of amounts capitalized\nInterest expense increased $19.6 million to $73.8 million (9.3% of revenues), for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $54.2 million (3.8% of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is primarily related to increased borrowings and interest rate under the new Term Loan Facility in the year ended December 31, 2015 and the write-off of the remaining $0.8 million of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the 2011 Credit Facility in the second quarter of 2015.\nOther loss, net\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized other loss, net, of $9.4 million, compared to other loss, net, of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. A $7.8 million allowance for the collectibility of our notes receivable related to the sale of our operations in Argentina was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2015.

These expenses decreased primarily due to no impairment expense in 2016 compared to $82.7 million impairment of goodwill and a $51.1 million impairment of fixed assets in 2015 and as a result of a decrease in employee compensation costs, repair and maintenance expense and fuel costs as we sought to reduce our cost structure and as a result of lower activity levels.\nFishing and Rental Services\nRevenues for our Fishing and Rental Services segment decreased $62.7 million, or 51.4%, to $59.2 million for the combined year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $121.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease for this segment is primarily due to lower spending from our customers as a result of lower oil prices. These market conditions resulted in reduced customer activity and a reduction in the price received for our services.\nOperating expenses for our Fishing and Rental Services segment were $85.9 million during the combined year ended December 31, 2016, which represented a decrease of $233.4 million, or 73.1%, compared to $319.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. These expenses decreased primarily due to no impairment expense in 2016 compared to $173.5 million impairment of goodwill and a $6.0 million impairment of intangible assets in 2015 and as a result of a decrease in employee compensation costs, repair and maintenance expense and fuel costs as we sought to reduce our cost structure and as a result of lower activity levels.\nInternational\nRevenues for our International segment decreased $34.9 million, or 69.3%, to $15.5 million for the combined year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $50.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower customer activity in Mexico and the exit of operations in the Middle East, South America.\nOperating expenses for our International segment decreased $158.2 million, or 68.0%, to $74.6 million for the combined year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $232.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. These expenses decreased primarily due to impairment expense of $44.6 million in 2016 compared to $80.8 million impairment of assets held for sale and a $4.4 million impairment of goodwill in 2015 and as a result of a decrease in employee compensation costs and equipment expense from lower activity and the exit of certain International markets.\nFunctional support\nOperating expenses for our Functional Support segment decreased $15.2 million, or 10.8%, to $125.6 million (30.1% of consolidated revenues) for the combined year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $140.8 million (17.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease is primarily due to lower employee compensation costs due to reduced staffing levels and $30.8 million lower expenses related to our FCPA investigations by the DOJ and the SEC, which concluded in April and August 2016, respectively, partially off-set by $25.8 million in professional fees related to corporate restructuring in 2016.\nYears Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nThe following table shows operating results for each of our reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015 Table 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>U.S. Rig Service\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fluid Management Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Coiled Tubing Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fishing and Rental Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Functional\nSupport\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues from external customers\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>377,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>792,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>685,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>244,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>319,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>232,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,819,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>(307,939\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(43,484\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(155,168\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(197,412\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(182,536\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(140,770\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,027,309\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>U.S. Rig Service\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fluid Management Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Coiled Tubing Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fishing and Rental Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Functional\nSupport\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues from external customers\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>679,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>249,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>173,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>212,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>112,740\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,427,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>582,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>246,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>184,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>271,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>178,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>168,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,631,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>96,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,819\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(58,944\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(65,432\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(168,394\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(203,875\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nU.S. Rig Services\nRevenues for our U.S. Rig Services segment decreased $301.9 million, or 44.5%, to $377.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $679.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease for this segment is primarily due to lower spending from our customers as a result of lower oil prices. These market conditions resulted in reduced customer activity and a reduction in the price received for our services.\nOperating expenses for our U.S. Rig Services segment were $685.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, which represented an increase of $102.4 million, or 17.6%, compared to $582.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. These expenses increased primarily as a result of a $297.7 million impairment of goodwill in 2015, partially offset by a decrease in employee compensation costs and equipment expense as we sought to reduce our cost structure and as a result of lower activity levels.\nFluid Management Services\nRevenues for our Fluid Management Services segment decreased $96.4 million, or 38.6%, to $153.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $249.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease for this segment is primarily due to lower spending from our customers as a result of lower oil prices. These market conditions resulted in reduced customer activity and a reduction in the price received for our services.\nOperating expenses for our Fluid Management Services segment were $196.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, which represented a decrease of $49.6 million, or 20.2%, compared to $246.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. These expenses decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in equipment expense and employee compensation costs as we sought to reduce our cost structure and as a result of lower activity levels. This decrease was partially offset by a $24.5 million impairment of goodwill recorded in 2015.\nCoiled Tubing Services\nRevenues for our Coiled Tubing Services segment decreased $83.5 million, or 48.2%, to $89.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $173.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease for this segment is primarily due to lower spending from our customers as a result of lower oil prices. These market conditions resulted in reduced customer activity and a reduction in the price received for our services.\nOperating expenses for our Coiled Tubing Services segment were $245.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, which represented an increase of $60.8 million, or 33.0%, compared to $184.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. These expenses increased primarily as a result of a $82.7 million impairment of goodwill and a $51.1 million impairment of fixed assets in 2015 compared to a $19.1 million impairment of goodwill in 2014, partially offset by a decrease in employee compensation costs, repair and maintenance expense and fuel costs as we sought to reduce our cost structure and as a result of lower activity levels.\nFishing and Rental Services\nRevenues for our Fishing and Rental Services segment decreased $90.7 million, or 42.7%, to $121.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $212.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease for this segment is primarily due to lower spending from our customers as a result of lower oil prices. These market conditions resulted in reduced customer activity and a reduction in the price received for our services.\nOperating expenses for our Fishing and Rental Services segment were $319.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, which represented an increase of $47.8 million, or 17.6%, compared to $271.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. These expenses increased primarily as a result of a $173.5 million impairment of goodwill and a $6.0 million impairment of intangible assets in 2015 compared to a $62.1 impairment of fixed assets in 2014, partially offset by a decrease in employee compensation costs, repair and maintenance expense and fuel costs as we sought to reduce our cost structure and as a result of lower activity levels.\nInternational\nRevenues for our International segment decreased $62.4 million, or 55.4%, to $50.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $112.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower customer activity in Russia and Colombia and the exit of operations in the Middle East and South America.\nOperating expenses for our International segment increased $54.7 million, or 30.7%, to $232.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $178.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. These expenses increased primarily as a result of an increase in impairment of assets held for sale of $80.8 million and a $4.4 million impairment of goodwill in 2015 compared to a $22.4 million impairment of goodwill and $6.3 million impairment of intangible assets in 2014, partially offset by a decrease in employee compensation costs and equipment expense, primarily due to lower activity.\nFunctional support\nOperating expenses for our Functional Support segment decreased $27.6 million, or 16.4%, to $140.8 million (17.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $168.4 million (11.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease is primarily due to lower employee compensation costs due to reduced staffing levels and reduction in wages and $31.6 million related to our FCPA investigations in 2015 compared to $41.1 million in 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe require capital to fund our ongoing operations, including maintenance expenditures on our existing fleet and equipment, organic growth initiatives, investments and acquisitions, our debt service payments and our other obligations. We believe that our internally generated cash flows from operations, current reserves of cash and availability under our ABL Facility are sufficient to finance our cash requirements for current and future operations, budgeted capital expenditures, debt service and other obligations for the next twelve months.\nOil and natural gas prices began a rapid and substantial decline in the fourth quarter of 2014. Depressed commodity price conditions persisted and worsened during 2015 and remained depressed during 2016. As a result, demand for our products and services declined substantially, and the prices we are able to charge our customers for our products and services have also declined substantially. These trends materially and adversely affected our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition during 2016 and, unless conditions in our industry improve, this trend will continue during 2017 and potentially beyond.\nIn response to these conditions, we have undertaken several actions detailed below in an effort to preserve and improve our liquidity and financial position.\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On December 15, 2016, the Company emerged from a pre-planned voluntary chapter 11 reorganization resulting in approximately $697 million of the Company's long-term debt being eliminated along with more than $45.6 million of annual interest expense going forward.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On December 15, 2016, we entered into our new $80 million ABL Facility (which was increased to $100 million on February 3, 2017) due June 15, 2021, and our new $250 million Term Loan Facility due December 15, 2021.

During 2016, our net cash used in operating activities was $138.4 million, and, if industry conditions do not improve, we may have negative cash flows from operations in 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our working capital was $117.8 million compared to $269.1 million as of December 31, 2015. Our working capital decreased during 2016 primarily as a result of repayment of long-term debt, decrease in accounts receivable and other current assets, which were partially offset by the receipt of cash proceeds from the rights offering as part of our restructuring and also by a decrease in accounts payable and other accrued expenses.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $90.5 million of cash, of which approximately $4.1 million was held in the bank accounts of our foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2016, $0.3 million of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries was held in U.S. bank accounts and denominated in U.S. dollars. We believe that the cash held by our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries could be repatriated for general corporate use without material withholdings.\nCash Flows\nCash used in operating activities was $0.4 million, $138.4 million, and $22.4 million for the periods from December 16, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and from January 1, 2016 through December 15, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively. Cash used by operating activities for these periods was primarily related to net loss adjusted for noncash items and payments of accounts payable and other accrued liabilities partially offset by cash inflows related to the collection of accounts receivable.\nCash used in investing activities was $0.3 million for the period from December 16, 2016 through December 31, 2016, and cash provided by investing activities was $6.5 million from January 1, 2016 through December 15, 2016, compared to cash of $19.4 million used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015. Investing cash inflows primarily relate to sales of assets during these periods. Investing cash outflows primarily relate to capital expenditures. Capital expenditures primarily relate to replacement assets for our existing fleet and equipment.\nCash provided by financing activities was $18.8 million and $218.7 million for the period from January 1, 2016 through December 15, 2016 and during the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash provided by financing activities for the period from January 1, 2016 through December 15, 2016 was primarily related to proceeds from stock offering partially offset by repayment of long-term debt and increase in restricted cash. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to proceeds from long-term debt partially offset by net payments on our previous credit facility.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the period from December 16, 2016 through December 31, 2016, period from January 1, 2016 through December 15, 2016 and year ended December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Successor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Predecessor\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Period from December 16, 2016 through December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Period from January 1, 2016 through December 15, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(417\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(138,449\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(22,386\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash paid for capital expenditures\n</td> <td>(375\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,481\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40,808\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from sale of assets\n</td> <td>124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from notes receivable\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>595\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repayments of long-term debt\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(313,424\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,575\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from long-term debt\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>305,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payment of bond tender premium\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restricted cash\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24,692\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from borrowings on revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>130,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repayments on revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(200,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payment of deferred financing costs\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,040\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,461\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other financing activities, net\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(167\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,785\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of changes in exchange rates on cash\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(683\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(113,166\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>177,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDebt Service\nAt December 31, 2016, our annual maturities on our indebtedness, consisting only of our Term Loan Facility at year-end, were as follows:\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Principal Payments\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018\n</td> <td>2,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>2,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020\n</td> <td>2,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021\n</td> <td>240,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022 and thereafter\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nABL Facility\nOn December 15, 2016, the Company and Key Energy Services, LLC, as borrowers (the ABL Borrowers\u201d), entered into the ABL Facility with the financial institutions party thereto from time to time as lenders (the ABL Lenders\u201d), Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent for the lenders, and Bank of America, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as co-collateral agents for the lenders. The ABL Facility provides for aggregate initial commitments from the ABL Lenders of $80 million, which, on February 3, 2017 was increased to $100 million, and matures on June 15, 2021.\nThe ABL Facility provides the ABL Borrowers with the ability to borrow up to an aggregate principal amount equal to the lesser of (i) the aggregate revolving commitments then in effect and (ii) the sum of (a) 85% of the value of eligible accounts receivable plus (b) 80% of the value of eligible unbilled accounts receivable, subject to a limit equal to the greater of (x) $35 million and (y) 25% of the Commitments. The amount that may be borrowed under the ABL Facility is subject to increase or reduction based on certain segregated cash or reserves provided for by the ABL Facility. In addition, the percentages of accounts receivable and unbilled accounts receivable included in the calculation described above is subject to reduction to the extent of certain bad debt write-downs and other dilutive items provided in the ABL Facility.\nBorrowings under the ABL Facility will bear interest, at the ABL Borrowers' option, at a per annum rate equal to (i) LIBOR for 30, 60, 90, 180, or, with the consent of the ABL Lenders, 360 days, plus an applicable margin that varies from 2.50% to 4.50% depending on the Borrowers' fixed charge coverage ratio at such time or (ii) a base rate equal to the sum of (a) the greatest of\n(x) the prime rate, (y) the federal funds rate, plus 0.50% or (z) 30-day LIBOR, plus 1.0% plus (b) an applicable margin that varies from 1.50% to 3.50% depending on the Borrowers' fixed charge coverage ratio at such time. In addition, the ABL Facility provides for unused line fees of 1.0% to 1.25% per year, depending on utilization, letter of credit fees and certain other factors.\nThe ABL Facility may in the future be guaranteed by certain of the Company's existing and future subsidiaries (the ABL Guarantors,\u201d and together with the ABL Borrowers, the ABL Loan Parties\u201d). To secure their obligations under the ABL Facility, each of the ABL Loan Parties has granted or will grant, as applicable, to the Administrative Agent a first-priority security interest for the benefit of the ABL Lenders in its present and future accounts receivable, inventory and related assets and proceeds of the foregoing (the ABL Priority Collateral\u201d). In addition, the obligations of the ABL Loan Parties under the ABL Facility are secured by second-priority liens on the Term Priority Collateral (as described below under Term Loan Facility\u201d).\nThe revolving loans under the ABL Facility may be voluntarily prepaid, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, subject to breakage or similar costs.\nThe ABL Facility contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that restrict the ability of the ABL Loan Parties to take certain actions including, among other things and subject to certain significant exceptions, the incurrence of debt, the granting of liens, the making of investments, entering into transactions with affiliates, the payment of dividends and the sale of assets. The ABL Facility also contains a requirement that the ABL Borrowers comply, during certain periods, with a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00 to 1.00.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had no borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility and $38.5 million of letters of credit outstanding with borrowing capacity of $27.7 million available subject to covenant constraints under our ABL Facility.\nTerm Loan Facility\nOn December 15, 2016, the Company entered into the Term Loan Facility among the Company, as borrower, certain subsidiaries of the Company named as guarantors therein, the financial institutions party thereto from time to time as Lenders (collectively, the Term Loan Lenders\u201d) and Cortland Capital Market Services LLC and Cortland Products Corp., as agent for the Term Loan Lenders. The Term Loan Facility had an outstanding principal amount of $250 million as of the Effective Date.\nThe Term Loan Facility will mature on December 15, 2021, although such maturity date may, at the Company's request, be extended by one or more of the Term Loan Lenders pursuant to the terms of the Term Loan Facility. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility will bear interest, at the Company's option, at a per annum rate equal to (i) LIBOR for one, two, three, six, or, with the consent of the Term Loan Lenders, 12 months, plus 10.25% or (ii) a base rate equal to the sum of (a) the greatest of (x) the prime rate, (y) the Federal Funds rate, plus 0.50% and (z) 30-day LIBOR, plus 1.0% plus (b) 9.25%.\nThe Term Loan Facility is guaranteed by certain of the Company's existing and future subsidiaries (the Term Loan Guarantors,\u201d and together with the Company, the Term Loan Parties\u201d). To secure their obligations under the Term Loan Facility, each of the Term Loan Parties has granted or will grant, as applicable, to the agent a first-priority security interest for the benefit of the Term Loan Lenders in substantially all of each Term Loan Party's assets other than certain excluded assets and the ABL Priority Collateral (the Term Priority Collateral\u201d). In addition, the obligations of the Term Loan Parties under the Term Loan Facility are secured by second-priority liens on the ABL Priority Collateral (as described above under ABL Facility\u201d).\nThe loans under the Term Loan Facility may be prepaid at the Company's option, subject to the payment of a prepayment premium in certain circumstances as provided in the Term Loan Facility. If a prepayment is made prior to the first anniversary of the loan, such prepayment must be made with make-whole amount with the calculation of the make-whole amount as specified in the Term Loan Facility. If a prepayment is made after the first anniversary of the loan but prior to the second anniversary, such prepayment must be made at 106% of the principle amount, if a prepayment is made after the second anniversary but prior to the third anniversary, such prepayment must be made at 103% of the principle amount. After the third anniversary, if a prepayment is made, no prepayment premium is due. The Company is required to make principal payments in the amount of $625,000 per quarter commencing with the quarter ending March 31, 2017. In addition, pursuant to the Term Loan Facility, the Company must prepay or offer to prepay, as applicable, term loans with the net cash proceeds of certain debt incurrences and asset sales, excess cash flow, and upon certain change of control transactions, subject in each case to certain exceptions.\nThe Term Loan Facility contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that restrict the ability of the Term Loan Parties to take certain actions including, among other things and subject to certain significant exceptions, the incurrence of debt, the granting of liens, the making of investments, entering into transactions with affiliates, the payment of dividends and the sale of assets. The Term Loan Facility also contains financial covenants requiring that the Company maintain an asset coverage ratio of at least 1.35 to 1.0 and that Liquidity (as defined in the Term Loan Facility) must not be less than $37.5 million (of which at least $20.0 million must be in cash or cash equivalents held in deposit accounts) as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, subject to certain exceptions and cure rights.\nLetter of Credit Facility\nOn November 7, 2013, we entered into an uncommitted, unsecured $15.0 million letter of credit facility to be used solely for the issuances of performance letters of credit. As of December 31, 2016, $2.0 million of letters of credit were outstanding under the facility.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2016, we did not, and we currently do not, have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nContractual Obligations\nSet forth below is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016. The obligations we pay in future periods reflect certain assumptions, including variability in interest rates on our variable-rate obligations and the duration of our obligations, and actual payments in future periods may vary.\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1\nYear (2017)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n(2018-2020)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5 Years\n(2021-2022)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 5 Years\n(2023+)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term Loan Facility due 2021\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>240,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest associated with Term Loan Facility(1)\n</td> <td>137,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cancelable operating leases\n</td> <td>18,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,698\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>405,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>98,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>269,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Based on interest rates in effect at December 31, 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Debt Compliance\nAt December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all the financial covenants under our ABL Facility and the Term Loan Facility. Based on management's current projections, we expect to be in compliance with all the covenants under our ABL Facility and Term Loan Facility for the next twelve months. A breach of any of these covenants, ratios or tests could result in a default under our indebtedness. See - Debt Service\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d\nCapital Expenditures\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, our capital expenditures totaled $8.5 million, primarily related to the ongoing replacement to our rig service fleet, coiled tubing units, fluid transportation equipment and rental equipment. Our capital expenditure plan for 2017 contemplates spending between $10 million and $20 million, subject to market conditions. This is primarily related to equipment replacement needs, including ongoing replacement to our rig services fleet. Our capital expenditure program for 2017 is subject to market conditions, including activity levels, commodity prices, industry capacity and specific customer needs as well as cash flows. Our focus for 2017 will be the maximization of our current equipment fleet, but we may choose to increase our capital expenditures in 2017 to expand our presence in a market. We currently anticipate funding our 2017 capital expenditures through a combination of cash on hand, operating cash flow, proceeds from sales of assets and borrowings under our ABL Facility. Should our operating cash flows or activity levels prove to be insufficient to fund our currently planned capital spending levels, management expects it will adjust our capital spending plans accordingly. We may also incur capital expenditures for strategic investments and acquisitions.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur Accounting Department is responsible for the development and application of our accounting policies and internal control procedures and reports to the Chief Financial Officer.\nThe process of preparing our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions, which may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingencies at the balance sheet date, the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period and the presentation of our statement of cash flows. We may record materially different amounts if these estimates, judgments and assumptions change or if actual results differ. However, we analyze our estimates, assumptions and judgments based on our historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nWe have identified the following critical accounting policies that require a significant amount of estimation or judgment to accurately present our financial position, results of operations and cash flows:\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Revenue recognition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Estimate of reserves for workers' compensation, vehicular liability and other self-insurance;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Contingencies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Income taxes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Estimates of depreciable lives;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Valuation of indefinite-lived intangible assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Valuation of tangible and finite-lived intangible assets; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Valuation of equity-based compensation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Revenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when all of the following criteria have been met: (i) evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the price to the customer is fixed and determinable and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Evidence of an arrangement exists when a final understanding between us and our customer has occurred, and can be evidenced by a completed customer purchase order, field ticket, supplier contract, or master service agreement.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Delivery has occurred or services have been rendered when we have completed requirements pursuant to the terms of the arrangement as evidenced by a field ticket or service log.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The price to the customer is fixed and determinable when the amount that is required to be paid is agreed upon. Evidence of the price being fixed and determinable is evidenced by contractual terms, our price book, a completed customer purchase order, or a field ticket.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Collectability is reasonably assured when we screen our customers and provide goods and services to customers according to determined credit terms that have been granted in accordance with our credit policy.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We present our revenues net of any sales taxes collected by us from our customers that are required to be remitted to local or state governmental taxing authorities.\nWe review our contracts for multiple element revenue arrangements. Deliverables will be separated into units of accounting and assigned fair value if they have standalone value to our customer, have objective and reliable evidence of fair value, and delivery of undelivered items is substantially controlled by us. We believe that the negotiated prices for deliverables in our services contracts are representative of fair value since the acceptance or non-acceptance of each element in the contract does not affect the other elements.\nWorkers' Compensation, Vehicular Liability and Other Self-Insurance\nThe occurrence of an event not fully insured or indemnified against, or the failure of a customer or insurer to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations, could result in substantial losses. In addition, insurance may not be available to cover any or all of these risks, and, if available, we might not be able to obtain such insurance without a substantial increase in premiums. It is possible that, in addition to higher premiums, future insurance coverage may be subject to higher deductibles and coverage restrictions.\nWe estimate our liability arising out of uninsured and potentially insured events, including workers' compensation, employer's liability, vehicular liability, and general liability, and record accruals in our consolidated financial statements. Reserves related to claims are based on the specific facts and circumstances of the insured event and our past experience with similar claims and trend analysis. We adjust loss estimates in the calculation of these accruals based upon actual claim settlements and reported claims. Loss estimates for individual claims are adjusted based upon actual claim judgments, settlements and reported claims. The actual outcome of these claims could differ significantly from estimated amounts. Changes in our assumptions and estimates could potentially have a negative impact on our earnings.\nWe are primarily self-insured against physical damage to our property, rigs, equipment and automobiles due to large deductibles or self-insurance.\nContingencies\nWe are periodically required to record other loss contingencies, which relate to lawsuits, claims, proceedings and tax-related audits in the normal course of our operations, on our consolidated balance sheet. We record a loss contingency for these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We periodically review our loss contingencies to ensure that we have recorded appropriate liabilities on the balance sheet. We adjust these liabilities based on estimates and judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters, including the effect of any applicable insurance coverage for litigation matters. Our estimates and judgments could change based on new information,\nchanges in laws or regulations, changes in management's plans or intentions, the outcome of legal proceedings, settlements or other factors. Actual results could vary materially from these reserves.\nWe record liabilities when environmental assessment indicates that site remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. We measure environmental liabilities based, in part, on relevant past experience, currently enacted laws and regulations, existing technology, site-specific costs and cost-sharing arrangements. Recognition of any joint and several liability is based upon our best estimate of our final pro-rata share of such liability or the low amount in a range of estimates. These assumptions involve the judgments and estimates of management, and any changes in assumptions or new information could lead to increases or decreases in our ultimate liability, with any such changes recognized immediately in earnings.\nWe record legal obligations to retire tangible, long-lived assets on our balance sheet as liabilities, which are recorded at a discount when we incur the liability. Significant judgment is involved in estimating our future cash flows associated with such obligations, as well as the ultimate timing of the cash flows. If our estimates on the amount or timing of the cash flows change, the change may have a material impact on our results of operations.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability method and provide income taxes for all significant temporary differences. Management determines our current tax liability as well as taxes incurred as a result of current operations, yet deferred until future periods. Current taxes payable represent our liability related to our income tax returns for the current year, while net deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets and liabilities reported on our consolidated balance sheets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Further, management makes certain assumptions about the timing of temporary tax differences for the differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes or whether such differences are permanent. The final determination of our tax liability involves the interpretation of local tax laws, tax treaties, and related authorities in each jurisdiction as well as the significant use of estimates and assumptions regarding the scope of future operations and results achieved and the timing and nature of income earned and expenditures incurred.\nWe record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets if we determine that it is more likely than not (e.g., a likelihood of more than 50%) that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. To assess the likelihood, we use estimates and judgment regarding our future taxable income, as well as the jurisdiction in which this taxable income is generated, to determine whether a valuation allowance is required. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character and in the related jurisdiction in the future. Evidence supporting this ability can include our current financial position, our results of operations, both actual and forecasted results, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, and tax planning strategies as well as the current and forecasted business economics of our industry. Additionally, we record uncertain tax positions in the financial statements at their net recognizable amount, based on the amount that management deems is more likely than not to be sustained upon ultimate settlement with the tax authorities in the domestic and international tax jurisdictions in which we operate.\nIf our estimates or assumptions regarding our current and deferred tax items are inaccurate or are modified, these changes could have potentially material negative impacts on our earnings.\nEstimates of Depreciable Lives\nWe use the estimated depreciable lives of our long-lived assets, such as rigs, heavy-duty trucks and trailers, to compute depreciation expense, to estimate future asset retirement obligations and to conduct impairment tests. We base the estimates of our depreciable lives on a number of factors, such as the environment in which the assets operate, industry factors including forecasted prices and competition, and the assumption that we provide the appropriate amount of capital expenditures while the asset is in operation to maintain economical operation of the asset and prevent untimely demise to scrap. The useful lives of our intangible assets are determined by the years over which we expect the assets to generate a benefit based on legal, contractual or other expectations.\nWe depreciate our operational assets over their depreciable lives to their salvage value, which is generally 10% of the acquisition cost. We recognize a gain or loss upon ultimate disposal of the asset based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset on the disposal date and any proceeds we receive in connection with the disposal.\nWe periodically analyze our estimates of the depreciable lives of our fixed assets to determine if the depreciable periods and salvage value continue to be appropriate. We also analyze useful lives and salvage value when events or conditions occur that could shorten the remaining depreciable life of the asset. We review the depreciable periods and salvage values for reasonableness, given current conditions. As a result, our depreciation expense is based upon estimates of depreciable lives of the fixed assets, the salvage value and economic factors, all of which require management to make significant judgments and estimates. If we determine that the depreciable lives should be different than originally estimated, depreciation expense may increase or decrease and impairments in the carrying values of our fixed assets may result, which could negatively impact our earnings.\nValuation of Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nWe periodically review our intangible assets not subject to amortization, including our goodwill, to determine whether an impairment of those assets may exist. These tests must be made on at least an annual basis, or more often if circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, significant adverse changes in the business climate.\nThe test for impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets allows us to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not\u201d that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. If our qualitative analysis shows that it is more likely than not\u201d that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we will perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. In the first step, a fair value is calculated for each of our reporting units, and that fair value is compared to the current carrying value of the reporting unit, including the reporting unit's goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, there is no potential impairment, and the second step is not performed. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then the second step is required.\nThe second step of the test for impairment compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill to its current carrying value. The implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be recognized in a business combination, with the purchase price being equal to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is in excess of its carrying value, no impairment charge is recorded. If the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill is in excess of its implied fair value, an impairment charge equal to the excess is recorded.\nIn determining the fair value of our reporting units, we use a weighted-average approach of three commonly used valuation techniques - a discounted cash flow method, a guideline companies method, and a similar transactions method. We assigned a weight to the results of each of these methods based on the facts and circumstances that are in existence for that testing period. We assigned more weight to the discounted cash flow method as we believe it is more representative of the future of the business.\nIn addition to the estimates made by management regarding the weighting of the various valuation techniques, the creation of the techniques themselves requires that we make significant estimates and assumptions. The discounted cash flow method, which was assigned the highest weight by management during the current year, requires us to make assumptions about future cash flows, future growth rates, tax rates in future periods, book-tax differences in the carrying value of our assets in future periods, and discount rates. The assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on our current budgets for future periods, as well as our strategic plans, the beliefs of management about future activity levels, and analysts' expectations about our revenues, profitability and cash flows in future periods. The assumptions about our future tax rates and book-tax differences in the carrying value of our assets in future periods are based on the assumptions about our future cash flows and growth rates, and management's knowledge of and beliefs about tax law and practice in current and future periods. The assumptions about discount rates include an assessment of the specific risk associated with each reporting unit being tested, and were developed with the assistance of a third-party valuation consultant. The ultimate conclusions of the valuation techniques remain our responsibility.\nValuation of Tangible and Finite-Lived Intangible Assets\nOur fixed assets and finite-lived intangibles are tested for potential impairment when circumstances or events indicate a possible impairment may exist. These circumstances or events are referred to as trigger events\u201d and examples of such trigger events include, but are not limited to, an adverse change in market conditions, a significant decrease in benefits being derived from an acquired business, a change in the use of an asset, or a significant disposal of a particular asset or asset class.\nIf a trigger event occurs, an impairment test is performed based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis. To perform an impairment test, we make judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding long-term forecasts of revenues and expenses relating to the assets subject to review. Market conditions, energy prices, estimated depreciable lives of the assets, discount rate assumptions and legal factors impact our operations and have a significant effect on the estimates we use to determine whether our assets are impaired. If the results of the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicate that the carrying value of the assets being tested for impairment are not recoverable, then we record an impairment charge to write the carrying value of the assets down to their fair value. Using different judgments, assumptions or estimates, we could potentially arrive at a materially different fair value for the assets being tested for impairment, which may result in an impairment charge.\nValuation of Equity-Based Compensation\nWe issue time based vesting and performance based vesting stock options, time based vesting and performance based vesting restricted stock units, and restricted stock awards to our employees and non-employee directors. The options we grant are fair valued using a Black-Scholes option model on the grant date and are amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period of the option, net of estimated and actual forfeitures. Compensation related to restricted stock units and restricted stock awards is based on the fair value of the award on the grant date and is recognized based on the vesting requirements that have been satisfied during the period. The grant-date fair value of our restricted stock units and restricted stock awards is determined using our stock price on the grant date.\nIn utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine fair values of stock options, certain assumptions are made which are based on subjective expectations, and are subject to change. A change in one or more of these assumptions would impact the expense associated with future grants. These key assumptions include the historical stock price volatility, the risk-free interest rate and the expected life of awards. In view of the limited amount of time elapsed since our reorganization, volatility is calculated based on historical stock price volatility of our peer group with a lookback period equivalent to the expected term of the award.\nValuation of Warrants\nPursuant to the Plan and on the Effective Date, the Company issued two series of warrants to the former holders of the Predecessor Company's common stock. One series of warrants will expire on December 15, 2020 and the other series of warrants will expire on December 15, 2021. Each warrant is exercisable for one share of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01. At issuance, the warrants were recorded at fair value, which was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The warrants are equity classified and, at issuance, were recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital in the amount of $3.8 million.\nRecent Accounting Developments\nASU 2016-18. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Restricted Cash. This standard provides guidance on the presentation of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period amounts shown on the statements of cash flows. The amendments of this ASU should be applied using a retrospective transition method and are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. Other than the revised statement of cash flows presentation of restricted cash, the adoption of ASU 2016-18 is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nASU 2016-15. In August 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force) (ASU 2016-15)\u201d, that clarifies how entities should classify certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows. The guidance also clarifies how the predominance principle should be applied when cash receipts and cash payments have aspects of more than one class of cash flows. The guidance will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect of ASU 2016-15 on its consolidated financial statements.\nASU 2016-13. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, \"Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\u201d that will change how companies measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that aren't measured at fair value through net income. The standard will replace today's incurred loss\u201d approach with an expected loss\u201d model for instruments measured at amortized cost. For available-for-sale debt securities, entities will be required to record allowances rather than reduce the carrying amount. The amendments in this update will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is evaluating the effect of ASU 2016-13 on our consolidated financial statements.\nASU 2016-09. In March 2016, the FASB Issued ASU 2016-09 Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The updated guidance changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The Company will adopt the accounting guidance as of January 1, 2017. The adoption of this ASU will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nASU 2016-02. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which will replace the existing lease guidance. The standard is intended to provide enhanced transparency and comparability by requiring lessees to record right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities on the balance sheet. Additional disclosure requirements include qualitative disclosures along with specific quantitative disclosures with the objective of enabling users of financial statements to assess the\namount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for the Company for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The new standard is required to be applied with a modified retrospective approach to each prior reporting period presented. We are currently evaluating the standard to determine the impact of its adoption on the consolidated financial statements.\nASU 2015-17. In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (Topic 740). The objective of this ASU is to simplify the current guidance which requires entities to separately present deferred tax assets and liabilities as current and non-current in a classified balance sheet. The new guidance will require entities to present deferred tax assets and liabilities as non-current in a classified balance sheet. We adopted ASU 2015-17 in the fourth quarter of 2016 and have reclassified net current deferred tax assets of $10.1 million into non-current deferred tax asset and liabilities. We adopted ASU 2015-17 prospectively and no prior periods have been restated to conform to the new presentation. The adoption has no effect on net income or cash flows.\nASU 2014-09. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The objective of this ASU is to establish the principles to report useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue from contracts with customers. The core principle is to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 must be adopted using either a full retrospective method or a modified retrospective method. During a July 2015 meeting, the FASB affirmed a proposal to defer the effective date of the new revenue standard for all entities by one year. As a result, ASU 2014-09 is effective for the Company for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the standard to determine the impact of its adoption on the consolidated financial statements, however, management believes that the impact to the financial statements will not be material.", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I am unable to complete your request because I am unable to identify the context of your request.\n- Could you please provide additional details or more context around your request?\n- I'm not sure I understand your request.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d The discussion below contains forward-looking statements that are based upon our current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances including those identified in Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d above. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations due to potentially inaccurate assumptions and known or unknown\nrisks and uncertainties. Such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nWe provide a full range of well services to major oil companies, foreign national oil companies and independent oil and natural gas production companies to produce, maintain and enhance the flow of oil and natural gas throughout the life of a well. These services include rig-based and coiled tubing-based well maintenance and workover services, well completion and recompletion services, fluid management services, fishing and rental services and other ancillary oilfield services. Additionally, certain of our rigs are capable of specialty drilling applications. We operate in most major oil and natural gas producing regions of the continental United States, and we have operations in Russia, which we are attempting to sell. In addition, we have a technology development and control systems business based in Canada.\nThe demand for our services fluctuates, primarily in relation to the price (or anticipated price) of oil and natural gas, which, in turn, is driven primarily by the supply of, and demand for, oil and natural gas. Generally, as supply of those commodities decreases and demand increases, service and maintenance requirements increase as oil and natural gas producers attempt to maximize the productivity of their wells in a higher priced environment. However, in the lower oil and natural gas price environment that has persisted since late 2014, demand for service and maintenance has decreased as oil and natural gas producers decrease their activity. In particular, the demand for new or existing field drilling and completion work is driven by available investment capital for such work and our customers have significantly curtailed their capital spending in both 2015 and 2016. Because these types of services can be easily started\u201d and stopped,\u201d and oil and natural gas producers generally tend to be less risk tolerant when commodity prices are low or volatile, we may experience a more rapid decline in demand for well maintenance services compared with demand for other types of oilfield services. Further, in a lower-priced environment, fewer well service rigs are needed for completions, as these activities are generally associated with drilling activity.\nEmergence from Voluntary Reorganization and Fresh Start Accounting\nUpon our emergence from bankruptcy on the Effective Date, the Company adopted fresh start accounting which resulted in the creation of a new entity for financial reporting purposes. As a result of the application of fresh start accounting, as well as the effects of the implementation of the Plan, the Consolidated Financial Statements on or after December 16, 2016 are not comparable with the Consolidated Financial Statements prior to that date. Refer to Note 3. Fresh Start Accounting\u201d in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information.\nReferences to Successor\u201d or Successor Company\u201d relate to the financial position and results of operations of the reorganized Company subsequent to December 15, 2016. References to Predecessor\u201d or Predecessor Company\u201d refer to the financial position and results of operations of the Company prior to December 15, 2016.\nBusiness and Growth Strategies\nFocus on Production Related Services\nOver the life of an oil and gas well, regular maintenance of well bore and artificial lift systems is required to maintain production and offset natural production declines. In most of these interventions, a well service rig is required to remove and replace items needing repair, or to perform activities that would increase the oil and gas production from current levels. In many instances these interventions require additional assets or services to perform. With the decline in oil prices beginning in 2014, we believe that a number of oil and gas producers in the United States significantly curtailed their recurring well maintenance activities. We believe that a recovery in oil prices will result in oil and gas producers making the decision to resume regular well maintenance activities. Additionally, we believe that in many instances since the oil price decline began in 2014, oil and gas producers have foregone regular maintenance activities, and that additional demand for our services will be provided by oil and gas producers seeking to improve their production by repairing their wells. Key is well positioned to capitalize on these trends through its fleet of active and warm stacked well service rigs and the additional fishing and rental service offerings it provides and we will continue to invest, either in equipment or through acquisition to grow and take advantage of this dynamic.\nGrowth in Population of Horizontal Oil and Gas Wells\nSince the revolution of horizontal well drilling and hydraulic fracturing began in the United States, thousands of new horizontal oil wells have been added, many in the period from 2012 to 2014. As the initial production from these wells decline over their first several years of production, and these wells are placed on artificial lift systems to maintain production, we believe that these wells will require periodic maintenance similar to a conventional oil well. In many instances due to the depth and long lateral sections of these wells, a larger well service rig with a higher rated derrick capacity will be needed to do this maintenance. We intend to invest in this portion of our well service rig fleet, and the needed rental equipment and services, either through organic capital deployment or acquisition to capitalize on this trend and the growing population of horizontal wells that have entered or will enter the phase of their life where regular maintenance is required.\nPERFORMANCE MEASURES\nThe Baker Hughes U.S. rig count data, which is publicly available on a weekly basis, is often used as a coincident indicator of overall Exploration and Production ( E&P\u201d) company spending and broader oilfield activity. In assessing overall activity in the U.S. onshore oilfield service industry in which we operate, we believe that the Baker Hughes U.S. land drilling rig count is the best barometer of E&P companies' capital spending and resulting activity levels. Historically, our activity levels have been highly correlated to U.S. onshore capital spending by our E&P company customers as a group.\n\n (1) Represents the average of the monthly average prices for each of the years presented. Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration, Bloomberg. \n (2) Source: www.bakerhughes.com  Internally, we measure activity levels for our well servicing operations primarily through our rig and trucking hours. Generally, as capital spending by E&P companies increases, demand for our services also rises, resulting in increased rig and trucking services and more hours worked. Conversely, when activity levels decline due to lower spending by E&P companies, we generally provide fewer rig and trucking services, which results in lower hours worked. The following table presents our quarterly rig and trucking hours from 2014 through 2016.\n\n (1) Key's U.S. working days are the number of weekdays during the quarter minus national holidays. \nMARKET AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS AND OUTLOOK\nOur core businesses depend on our customers' willingness to make expenditures to produce, develop and explore for oil and natural gas. Industry conditions are influenced by numerous factors, such as oil and natural gas prices, the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, domestic and worldwide economic conditions, and political instability in oil producing countries. Oil and natural gas prices began a rapid and substantial decline in the fourth quarter of 2014. Depressed commodity price conditions\npersisted and worsened during 2015 and that trend continued into 2016. As a result, the rig count and demand for our products and services declined substantially, and the prices we are able to charge our customers for our products and services have also declined substantially. While we have sought to anticipate activity declines and have reshaped our organizational and cost structure to mitigate the negative impact of these declines, we have continued to experience negative operating results and cash flows from operations. Although oil prices have improved off the low point of 2016, and our revenues improved in the fourth quarter of 2016 over the third quarter of 2016, we have not experienced an uptick in activity levels commensurate with increases in oil prices. The November 2016 decision by OPEC to curtail the cartel's oil production has provided for continued improvement in oil prices and in the future outlook for oil prices and thus improvement in the spending outlook for our customers. We believe that with this improved outlook and increased spending by our customers, demand for our services will continue to improve, allowing for increases in both activity and the price of our services over 2017. With increased demand for oilfield services broadly, however, the demand for qualified employees will also increase, which may impact our ability to meet the needs of our customers or to offset inflation in labor costs with price increases from our customers.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following tables set forth consolidated results of operations and financial information by operating segment and other selected information for the periods indicated. The period from December 16 to December 31, 2016 (Successor Company) and the period from January 1 to December 15, 2016 (Predecessor Company) are distinct reporting periods as a result of our emergence from bankruptcy on December 15, 2016. References in these results of operations to the change and the percentage change combine the Successor Company and Predecessor Company results for the year ended December 31, 2016 in order to provide some comparability of such information to the year ended December 31, 2015. While this combined presentation is not presented according to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d) and no comparable GAAP measure are presented, management believes that providing this financial information is the most relevant and useful method for making comparisons to the year ended December 31, 2015.\n\nYears Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nRevenues\nOur revenues for the combined year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $375.1 million, or 47.3%, to $417.3 million from $792.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, due to lower spending from our customers as a result of lower oil prices. These market conditions resulted in reduced customer activity and a reduction in the price received for our services. Internationally, we had lower revenue as a result of reduced customer activity in Russia and Colombia and the exit of operations in the Middle East and South America. See Segment Operating Results - Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\u201d below for a more detailed discussion of the change in our revenues.\nDirect operating expenses\nOur direct operating expenses decreased $335.2 million, or 46.9%, to $379.4 million (90.9% of revenues) for the combined year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $714.6 million (90.2% of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease is primarily related to a decrease in employee compensation costs, fuel expense and repair and maintenance expense as we sought to reduce our cost structure and as a result of lower activity levels. See Segment Operating Results - Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\u201d below for a more detailed discussion of the change in our direct operating expenses.\nDepreciation and amortization expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $45.4 million, or 25.2%, to $134.9 million (32.3% of revenues) for the combined year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $180.3 million (22.8% of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to the impairment of certain fixed assets in 2015 and decreases in capital expenditures and lower amortization expense due to the impairment of certain intangible assets.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $32.9 million, or 16.2%, to $169.8 million (40.7% of revenues) for the combined year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $202.6 million (25.6% of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease is primarily due to lower employee compensation costs due to reduced staffing levels and reduction in wages and $30.8 million lower expenses related to our FCPA investigations by the DOJ and the SEC, which concluded in April and August 2016, respectively, partially off-set by $25.8 million in restructuring fees in 2016.\nImpairment expense\nDuring the combined year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a $44.6 million impairment to reduce the carrying value of assets held for sale to fair market value related to our business unit in Mexico. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a $582.7 million impairment of goodwill, a $51.1 million impairment of fixed assets that are being held and used, a $1.5 million impairment of other intangible assets that are no longer being used, and a $86.8 million impairment of fixed assets to reduce the carrying value of assets held for sale to fair market value.\nReorganization items, net\nReorganization items primarily consist of $578.7 million gain on debt discharge partially offset by $299.6 million loss on fresh start accounting revaluations, $19.2 million write-off of deferred financing costs and debt premiums and discounts, and $15.2 million of professional fees incurred in connection with our emergence from voluntary reorganization.\nInterest expense, net of amounts capitalized\nInterest expense increased $1.8 million to $75.7 million (18.1% of revenues), for the combined year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $73.8 million (9.3% of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is primarily related to increased borrowings and interest rate under the new Term Loan Facility in the combined year ended December 31, 2016 and the write-off of the remaining $0.8 million of unamortized deferred financing costs related to a previously terminated credit facility in the second quarter of 2015.\nOther (income) loss, net\nDuring the combined year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized other income, net, of $2.4 million, compared to other loss, net, of $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. A $7.8 million allowance for the collectibility of our notes receivable related to the sale of our operations in Argentina was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2015. Our foreign exchange loss relates to U.S. dollar-denominated transactions in our foreign locations and fluctuations in exchange rates between local currencies and the U.S. dollar.\nThe table below presents comparative detailed information about combined other loss, net at December 31, 2016 and 2015:\n\nIncome tax (expense) benefit\nOur income tax benefit was zero (0.0% effective rate) on pre-tax loss of $10.2 million and $2.8 million (2.2% effective rate) on pre-tax loss of $128.9 million for the period from December 16, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and for the period from January 1, 2016 through December 15, 2016, respectively, compared to an income tax benefit of $192.8 million (17.4% effective rate) on a pre-tax loss of $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our effective tax rates for such periods differ from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% due to a number of factors, including the mix of profit and loss between domestic and international taxing jurisdictions and the impact of permanent items, including goodwill impairment expense and expenses subject to statutorily imposed limitations such as meals and entertainment expenses, that affect book income but do not affect taxable income and discrete tax adjustments, such as valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and tax expense or benefit recognized for uncertain tax positions.\nYears Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our operating loss was $1.0 billion, compared to an operating loss of $203.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Loss per share was $5.86 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1.16 loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nRevenues\nOur revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased $635.0 million, or 44.5%, to $792.3 million from $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, due to lower spending from our customers as a result of lower oil prices. These market conditions resulted in reduced customer activity and a reduction in the price received for our services. Internationally, we had lower revenue as a result of reduced customer activity in Russia and Colombia and the exit of operations in the Middle East and South America. See Segment Operating Results - Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\u201d below for a more detailed discussion of the change in our revenues.\nDirect operating expenses\nOur direct operating expenses decreased $345.0 million, or 32.6%, to $714.6 million (90.2% of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $1.06 billion (74.2% of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease is primarily related to a decrease in employee compensation costs, fuel expense and repair and maintenance expense as we sought to reduce our cost structure and as a result of lower activity levels. See Segment Operating Results - Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\u201d below for a more detailed discussion of the change in our direct operating expenses.\nDepreciation and amortization expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $20.5 million, or 10.2%, to $180.3 million (22.8% of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $200.7 million (14.1% of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease is primarily attributable to the impairment of certain fixed assets and decreases in capital expenditures and lower amortization expense due to the impairment of certain intangible assets.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $47.0 million, or 18.8%, to $202.6 million (25.6% of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $249.6 million (17.5% of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease is primarily due to lower employee compensation costs due to reduced staffing levels and reduction in wages and $31.6 million related to our FCPA investigations in 2015 compared to $41.1 million in 2014.\nImpairment expense\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a $582.7 million impairment of goodwill, a $51.1 million impairment of fixed assets that are being held and used, a $1.5 million impairment of other intangible assets that are no longer being used, and a $86.8 million impairment of fixed assets to reduce the carrying value of assets held for sale to fair market value. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a $28.7 million impairment of goodwill and tradenames in our Russian business unit which is included in our International reporting segment and a $73.4 million impairment of goodwill and fixed assets at our Fishing and Rental Services segment and a $19.1 million impairment of goodwill at our Coiled Tubing segment.\nInterest expense, net of amounts capitalized\nInterest expense increased $19.6 million to $73.8 million (9.3% of revenues), for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $54.2 million (3.8% of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is primarily related to increased borrowings and interest rate under the new Term Loan Facility in the year ended December 31, 2015 and the write-off of the remaining $0.8 million of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the 2011 Credit Facility in the second quarter of 2015.\nOther loss, net\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized other loss, net, of $9.4 million, compared to other loss, net, of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. A $7.8 million allowance for the collectibility of our notes receivable related to the sale of our operations in Argentina was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2015. Our foreign exchange loss relates to U.S. dollar-denominated transactions in our foreign locations and fluctuations in exchange rates between local currencies and the U.S. dollar.\nThe table below presents comparative detailed information about other loss, net at December 31, 2015 and 2014:\n\nIncome tax benefit\nOur income tax benefit on continuing operations was $192.8 million (17.4% effective rate) on pre-tax loss of $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to an income tax benefit of $80.5 million (31.1% effective rate) on a pre-tax loss of $259.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our effective tax rates for such periods differ from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% due to a number of factors, including the mix of profit and loss between domestic and international taxing jurisdictions and the impact of permanent items, including goodwill impairment expense and expenses subject to statutorily imposed limitations such as meals and entertainment expenses, that affect book income but do not affect taxable income and discrete tax adjustments, such as valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and tax expense or benefit recognized for uncertain tax positions.\nSegment Operating Results\nYears Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nThe following table shows operating results for each of our reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nFor the Successor period from December 16, 2016 through December 31, 2016\n\nFor the Predecessor period from January 1, 2016 through December 15, 2016\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015 \nU.S. Rig Services\nRevenues for our U.S. Rig Services segment decreased $145.7 million, or 38.6%, to $231.4 million for the combined year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $377.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

The decrease is primarily due to lower employee compensation costs due to reduced staffing levels and reduction in wages and $31.6 million related to our FCPA investigations in 2015 compared to $41.1 million in 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe require capital to fund our ongoing operations, including maintenance expenditures on our existing fleet and equipment, organic growth initiatives, investments and acquisitions, our debt service payments and our other obligations. We believe that our internally generated cash flows from operations, current reserves of cash and availability under our ABL Facility are sufficient to finance our cash requirements for current and future operations, budgeted capital expenditures, debt service and other obligations for the next twelve months.\nOil and natural gas prices began a rapid and substantial decline in the fourth quarter of 2014. Depressed commodity price conditions persisted and worsened during 2015 and remained depressed during 2016. As a result, demand for our products and services declined substantially, and the prices we are able to charge our customers for our products and services have also declined substantially. These trends materially and adversely affected our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition during 2016 and, unless conditions in our industry improve, this trend will continue during 2017 and potentially beyond.\nIn response to these conditions, we have undertaken several actions detailed below in an effort to preserve and improve our liquidity and financial position.\n \u2022 On December 15, 2016, the Company emerged from a pre-planned voluntary chapter 11 reorganization resulting in approximately $697 million of the Company's long-term debt being eliminated along with more than $45.6 million of annual interest expense going forward. \n \u2022 On December 15, 2016, we entered into our new $80 million ABL Facility (which was increased to $100 million on February 3, 2017) due June 15, 2021, and our new $250 million Term Loan Facility due December 15, 2021. As of December 31, 2016, we had no borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility and $38.5 million of letters of credit outstanding with borrowing capacity of $27.7 million available subject to covenant constraints under our ABL Facility. \n \u2022 In April 2015, we announced our decision to exit markets in which we participate outside of North America. Our strategy is to sell or relocate the assets of the businesses operating in these markets. As of December 31, 2015, we had sold our subsidiary in Bahrain and certain assets in Oman, Ecuador and Colombia and are no longer operating in these markets. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we completed the sale of our business in Mexico and we are currently in discussions to sell our business in Russia. \n \u2022 Beginning in the first quarter of 2015, we began a series of structural cost cutting changes at both corporate and field levels, which include fixed costs, supply-chain efficiencies and headcount and wage reductions. \nHowever, we still have substantial indebtedness and other obligations, and we may incur additional expenses that we are unable to predict at this time.\nOur ability to fund our operations, pay the principal and interest on our long-term debt and satisfy our other obligations will depend upon our available liquidity and the amount of cash flows we are able to generate from our operations. During 2016, our net cash used in operating activities was $138.4 million, and, if industry conditions do not improve, we may have negative cash flows from operations in 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our working capital was $117.8 million compared to $269.1 million as of December 31, 2015. Our working capital decreased during 2016 primarily as a result of repayment of long-term debt, decrease in accounts receivable and other current assets, which were partially offset by the receipt of cash proceeds from the rights offering as part of our restructuring and also by a decrease in accounts payable and other accrued expenses.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $90.5 million of cash, of which approximately $4.1 million was held in the bank accounts of our foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2016, $0.3 million of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries was held in U.S. bank accounts and denominated in U.S. dollars. We believe that the cash held by our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries could be repatriated for general corporate use without material withholdings.\nCash Flows\nCash used in operating activities was $0.4 million, $138.4 million, and $22.4 million for the periods from December 16, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and from January 1, 2016 through December 15, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively. Cash used by operating activities for these periods was primarily related to net loss adjusted for noncash items and payments of accounts payable and other accrued liabilities partially offset by cash inflows related to the collection of accounts receivable.\nCash used in investing activities was $0.3 million for the period from December 16, 2016 through December 31, 2016, and cash provided by investing activities was $6.5 million from January 1, 2016 through December 15, 2016, compared to cash of $19.4 million used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015. Investing cash inflows primarily relate to sales of assets during these periods. Investing cash outflows primarily relate to capital expenditures. Capital expenditures primarily relate to replacement assets for our existing fleet and equipment.\nCash provided by financing activities was $18.8 million and $218.7 million for the period from January 1, 2016 through December 15, 2016 and during the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash provided by financing activities for the period from January 1, 2016 through December 15, 2016 was primarily related to proceeds from stock offering partially offset by repayment of long-term debt and increase in restricted cash. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to proceeds from long-term debt partially offset by net payments on our previous credit facility.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the period from December 16, 2016 through December 31, 2016, period from January 1, 2016 through December 15, 2016 and year ended December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\n\nDebt Service\nAt December 31, 2016, our annual maturities on our indebtedness, consisting only of our Term Loan Facility at year-end, were as follows:\n\nABL Facility\nOn December 15, 2016, the Company and Key Energy Services, LLC, as borrowers (the ABL Borrowers\u201d), entered into the ABL Facility with the financial institutions party thereto from time to time as lenders (the ABL Lenders\u201d), Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent for the lenders, and Bank of America, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as co-collateral agents for the lenders. The ABL Facility provides for aggregate initial commitments from the ABL Lenders of $80 million, which, on February 3, 2017 was increased to $100 million, and matures on June 15, 2021.\nThe ABL Facility provides the ABL Borrowers with the ability to borrow up to an aggregate principal amount equal to the lesser of (i) the aggregate revolving commitments then in effect and (ii) the sum of (a) 85% of the value of eligible accounts receivable plus (b) 80% of the value of eligible unbilled accounts receivable, subject to a limit equal to the greater of (x) $35 million and (y) 25% of the Commitments. The amount that may be borrowed under the ABL Facility is subject to increase or reduction based on certain segregated cash or reserves provided for by the ABL Facility. In addition, the percentages of accounts receivable and unbilled accounts receivable included in the calculation described above is subject to reduction to the extent of certain bad debt write-downs and other dilutive items provided in the ABL Facility.\nBorrowings under the ABL Facility will bear interest, at the ABL Borrowers' option, at a per annum rate equal to (i) LIBOR for 30, 60, 90, 180, or, with the consent of the ABL Lenders, 360 days, plus an applicable margin that varies from 2.50% to 4.50% depending on the Borrowers' fixed charge coverage ratio at such time or (ii) a base rate equal to the sum of (a) the greatest of\n(x) the prime rate, (y) the federal funds rate, plus 0.50% or (z) 30-day LIBOR, plus 1.0% plus (b) an applicable margin that varies from 1.50% to 3.50% depending on the Borrowers' fixed charge coverage ratio at such time. In addition, the ABL Facility provides for unused line fees of 1.0% to 1.25% per year, depending on utilization, letter of credit fees and certain other factors.\nThe ABL Facility may in the future be guaranteed by certain of the Company's existing and future subsidiaries (the ABL Guarantors,\u201d and together with the ABL Borrowers, the ABL Loan Parties\u201d). To secure their obligations under the ABL Facility, each of the ABL Loan Parties has granted or will grant, as applicable, to the Administrative Agent a first-priority security interest for the benefit of the ABL Lenders in its present and future accounts receivable, inventory and related assets and proceeds of the foregoing (the ABL Priority Collateral\u201d). In addition, the obligations of the ABL Loan Parties under the ABL Facility are secured by second-priority liens on the Term Priority Collateral (as described below under Term Loan Facility\u201d).\nThe revolving loans under the ABL Facility may be voluntarily prepaid, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, subject to breakage or similar costs.\nThe ABL Facility contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that restrict the ability of the ABL Loan Parties to take certain actions including, among other things and subject to certain significant exceptions, the incurrence of debt, the granting of liens, the making of investments, entering into transactions with affiliates, the payment of dividends and the sale of assets. The ABL Facility also contains a requirement that the ABL Borrowers comply, during certain periods, with a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00 to 1.00.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had no borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility and $38.5 million of letters of credit outstanding with borrowing capacity of $27.7 million available subject to covenant constraints under our ABL Facility.\nTerm Loan Facility\nOn December 15, 2016, the Company entered into the Term Loan Facility among the Company, as borrower, certain subsidiaries of the Company named as guarantors therein, the financial institutions party thereto from time to time as Lenders (collectively, the Term Loan Lenders\u201d) and Cortland Capital Market Services LLC and Cortland Products Corp., as agent for the Term Loan Lenders. The Term Loan Facility had an outstanding principal amount of $250 million as of the Effective Date.\nThe Term Loan Facility will mature on December 15, 2021, although such maturity date may, at the Company's request, be extended by one or more of the Term Loan Lenders pursuant to the terms of the Term Loan Facility. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility will bear interest, at the Company's option, at a per annum rate equal to (i) LIBOR for one, two, three, six, or, with the consent of the Term Loan Lenders, 12 months, plus 10.25% or (ii) a base rate equal to the sum of (a) the greatest of (x) the prime rate, (y) the Federal Funds rate, plus 0.50% and (z) 30-day LIBOR, plus 1.0% plus (b) 9.25%.\nThe Term Loan Facility is guaranteed by certain of the Company's existing and future subsidiaries (the Term Loan Guarantors,\u201d and together with the Company, the Term Loan Parties\u201d). To secure their obligations under the Term Loan Facility, each of the Term Loan Parties has granted or will grant, as applicable, to the agent a first-priority security interest for the benefit of the Term Loan Lenders in substantially all of each Term Loan Party's assets other than certain excluded assets and the ABL Priority Collateral (the Term Priority Collateral\u201d). In addition, the obligations of the Term Loan Parties under the Term Loan Facility are secured by second-priority liens on the ABL Priority Collateral (as described above under ABL Facility\u201d).\nThe loans under the Term Loan Facility may be prepaid at the Company's option, subject to the payment of a prepayment premium in certain circumstances as provided in the Term Loan Facility. If a prepayment is made prior to the first anniversary of the loan, such prepayment must be made with make-whole amount with the calculation of the make-whole amount as specified in the Term Loan Facility. If a prepayment is made after the first anniversary of the loan but prior to the second anniversary, such prepayment must be made at 106% of the principle amount, if a prepayment is made after the second anniversary but prior to the third anniversary, such prepayment must be made at 103% of the principle amount. After the third anniversary, if a prepayment is made, no prepayment premium is due. The Company is required to make principal payments in the amount of $625,000 per quarter commencing with the quarter ending March 31, 2017. In addition, pursuant to the Term Loan Facility, the Company must prepay or offer to prepay, as applicable, term loans with the net cash proceeds of certain debt incurrences and asset sales, excess cash flow, and upon certain change of control transactions, subject in each case to certain exceptions.\nThe Term Loan Facility contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that restrict the ability of the Term Loan Parties to take certain actions including, among other things and subject to certain significant exceptions, the incurrence of debt, the granting of liens, the making of investments, entering into transactions with affiliates, the payment of dividends and the sale of assets. The Term Loan Facility also contains financial covenants requiring that the Company maintain an asset coverage ratio of at least 1.35 to 1.0 and that Liquidity (as defined in the Term Loan Facility) must not be less than $37.5 million (of which at least $20.0 million must be in cash or cash equivalents held in deposit accounts) as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, subject to certain exceptions and cure rights.\nLetter of Credit Facility\nOn November 7, 2013, we entered into an uncommitted, unsecured $15.0 million letter of credit facility to be used solely for the", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d The discussion below contains forward-looking statements that are based upon our current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances including those identified in Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d above. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations due to potentially inaccurate assumptions and known or unknown\nrisks and uncertainties. Such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nWe provide a full range of well services to major oil companies, foreign national oil companies and independent oil and natural gas production companies to produce, maintain and enhance the flow of oil and natural gas throughout the life of a well. These services include rig-based and coiled tubing-based well maintenance and workover services, well completion and recompletion services, fluid management services, fishing and rental services and other ancillary oilfield services. Additionally, certain of our rigs are capable of specialty drilling applications. We operate in most major oil and natural gas producing regions of the continental United States, and we have operations in Russia, which we are attempting to sell. In addition, we have a technology development and control systems business based in Canada.\nThe demand for our services fluctuates, primarily in relation to the price (or anticipated price) of oil and natural gas, which, in turn, is driven primarily by the supply of, and demand for, oil and natural gas. Generally, as supply of those commodities decreases and demand increases, service and maintenance requirements increase as oil and natural gas producers attempt to maximize the productivity of their wells in a higher priced environment. However, in the lower oil and natural gas price environment that has persisted since late 2014, demand for service and maintenance has decreased as oil and natural gas producers decrease their activity. In particular, the demand for new or existing field drilling and completion work is driven by available investment capital for such work and our customers have significantly curtailed their capital spending in both 2015 and 2016. Because these types of services can be easily started\u201d and stopped,\u201d and oil and natural gas producers generally tend to be less risk tolerant when commodity prices are low or volatile, we may experience a more rapid decline in demand for well maintenance services compared with demand for other types of oilfield services. Further, in a lower-priced environment, fewer well service rigs are needed for completions, as these activities are generally associated with drilling activity.\nEmergence from Voluntary Reorganization and Fresh Start Accounting\nUpon our emergence from bankruptcy on the Effective Date, the Company adopted fresh start accounting which resulted in the creation of a new entity for financial reporting purposes. As a result of the application of fresh start accounting, as well as the effects of the implementation of the Plan, the Consolidated Financial Statements on or after December 16, 2016 are not comparable with the Consolidated Financial Statements prior to that date. Refer to Note 3. Fresh Start Accounting\u201d in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information.\nReferences to Successor\u201d or Successor Company\u201d relate to the financial position and results of operations of the reorganized Company subsequent to December 15, 2016. References to Predecessor\u201d or Predecessor Company\u201d refer to the financial position and results of operations of the Company prior to December 15, 2016.\nBusiness and Growth Strategies\nFocus on Production Related Services\nOver the life of an oil and gas well, regular maintenance of well bore and artificial lift systems is required to maintain production and offset natural production declines. In most of these interventions, a well service rig is required to remove and replace items needing repair, or to perform activities that would increase the oil and gas production from current levels. In many instances these interventions require additional assets or services to perform. With the decline in oil prices beginning in 2014, we believe that a number of oil and gas producers in the United States significantly curtailed their recurring well maintenance activities. We believe that a recovery in oil prices will result in oil and gas producers making the decision to resume regular well maintenance activities. Additionally, we believe that in many instances since the oil price decline began in 2014, oil and gas producers have foregone regular maintenance activities, and that additional demand for our services will be provided by oil and gas producers seeking to improve their production by repairing their wells. Key is well positioned to capitalize on these trends through its fleet of active and warm stacked well service rigs and the additional fishing and rental service offerings it provides and we will continue to invest, either in equipment or through acquisition to grow and take advantage of this dynamic.\nGrowth in Population of Horizontal Oil and Gas Wells\nSince the revolution of horizontal well drilling and hydraulic fracturing began in the United States, thousands of new horizontal oil wells have been added, many in the period from 2012 to 2014. As the initial production from these wells decline over their first several years of production, and these wells are placed on artificial lift systems to maintain production, we believe that these wells will require periodic maintenance similar to a conventional oil well. In many instances due to the depth and long lateral sections of these wells, a larger well service rig with a higher rated derrick capacity will be needed to do this maintenance. We intend to invest in this portion of our well service rig fleet, and the needed rental equipment and services, either through organic capital deployment or acquisition to capitalize on this trend and the growing population of horizontal wells that have entered or will enter the phase of their life where regular maintenance is required.\nPERFORMANCE MEASURES\nThe Baker Hughes U.S. rig count data, which is publicly available on a weekly basis, is often used as a coincident indicator of overall Exploration and Production ( E&P\u201d) company spending and broader oilfield activity. In assessing overall activity in the U.S. onshore oilfield service industry in which we operate, we believe that the Baker Hughes U.S. land drilling rig count is the best barometer of E&P companies' capital spending and resulting activity levels. Historically, our activity levels have been highly correlated to U.S. onshore capital spending by our E&P company customers as a group.\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year\n</td> <td>WTI Cushing Crude\nOil(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NYMEX Henry Hub\nNatural Gas(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average Baker Hughes\nU.S. Land Drilling Rigs(2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2012\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2013\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97.98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.73\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2014\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48.66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>943\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>486\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Represents the average of the monthly average prices for each of the years presented.

Generally, as capital spending by E&P companies increases, demand for our services also rises, resulting in increased rig and trucking services and more hours worked. Conversely, when activity levels decline due to lower spending by E&P companies, we generally provide fewer rig and trucking services, which results in lower hours worked.

Industry conditions are influenced by numerous factors, such as oil and natural gas prices, the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, domestic and worldwide economic conditions, and political instability in oil producing countries. Oil and natural gas prices began a rapid and substantial decline in the fourth quarter of 2014. Depressed commodity price conditions\npersisted and worsened during 2015 and that trend continued into 2016. As a result, the rig count and demand for our products and services declined substantially, and the prices we are able to charge our customers for our products and services have also declined substantially. While we have sought to anticipate activity declines and have reshaped our organizational and cost structure to mitigate the negative impact of these declines, we have continued to experience negative operating results and cash flows from operations. Although oil prices have improved off the low point of 2016, and our revenues improved in the fourth quarter of 2016 over the third quarter of 2016, we have not experienced an uptick in activity levels commensurate with increases in oil prices. The November 2016 decision by OPEC to curtail the cartel's oil production has provided for continued improvement in oil prices and in the future outlook for oil prices and thus improvement in the spending outlook for our customers. We believe that with this improved outlook and increased spending by our customers, demand for our services will continue to improve, allowing for increases in both activity and the price of our services over 2017. With increased demand for oilfield services broadly, however, the demand for qualified employees will also increase, which may impact our ability to meet the needs of our customers or to offset inflation in labor costs with price increases from our customers.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following tables set forth consolidated results of operations and financial information by operating segment and other selected information for the periods indicated. The period from December 16 to December 31, 2016 (Successor Company) and the period from January 1 to December 15, 2016 (Predecessor Company) are distinct reporting periods as a result of our emergence from bankruptcy on December 15, 2016. References in these results of operations to the change and the percentage change combine the Successor Company and Predecessor Company results for the year ended December 31, 2016 in order to provide some comparability of such information to the year ended December 31, 2015. While this combined presentation is not presented according to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d) and no comparable GAAP measure are presented, management believes that providing this financial information is the most relevant and useful method for making comparisons to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Successor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Predecessor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(a) + (b) - (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Period from December 16, 2016 through December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Period from January 1, 2016 through December 15, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>REVENUES\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>399,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>792,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(375,073\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(47\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>COSTS AND EXPENSES:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expenses\n</td> <td>16,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>362,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>714,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(335,209\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(47\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization expense\n</td> <td>3,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>131,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>180,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(45,401\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>6,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>202,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32,873\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment expense\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>722,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(677,450\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(94\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss\n</td> <td>(8,848\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(302,601\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,027,309\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>715,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(70\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reorganization items, net\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(245,571\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(245,571\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized\n</td> <td>1,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (income) loss, net\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,443\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,805\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(126\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>(10,244\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(128,907\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,110,550\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>971,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(87\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,829\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(195,678\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(101\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NET LOSS\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,244\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(131,736\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(917,701\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>775,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(85\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYears Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nRevenues\nOur revenues for the combined year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $375.1 million, or 47.3%, to $417.3 million from $792.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, due to lower spending from our customers as a result of lower oil prices. These market conditions resulted in reduced customer activity and a reduction in the price received for our services. Internationally, we had lower revenue as a result of reduced customer activity in Russia and Colombia and the exit of operations in the Middle East and South America. See Segment Operating Results - Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\u201d below for a more detailed discussion of the change in our revenues.\nDirect operating expenses\nOur direct operating expenses decreased $335.2 million, or 46.9%, to $379.4 million (90.9% of revenues) for the combined year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $714.6 million (90.2% of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease is primarily related to a decrease in employee compensation costs, fuel expense and repair and maintenance expense as we sought to reduce our cost structure and as a result of lower activity levels. See Segment Operating Results - Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\u201d below for a more detailed discussion of the change in our direct operating expenses.\nDepreciation and amortization expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $45.4 million, or 25.2%, to $134.9 million (32.3% of revenues) for the combined year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $180.3 million (22.8% of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to the impairment of certain fixed assets in 2015 and decreases in capital expenditures and lower amortization expense due to the impairment of certain intangible assets.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $32.9 million, or 16.2%, to $169.8 million (40.7% of revenues) for the combined year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $202.6 million (25.6% of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease is primarily due to lower employee compensation costs due to reduced staffing levels and reduction in wages and $30.8 million lower expenses related to our FCPA investigations by the DOJ and the SEC, which concluded in April and August 2016, respectively, partially off-set by $25.8 million in restructuring fees in 2016.\nImpairment expense\nDuring the combined year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a $44.6 million impairment to reduce the carrying value of assets held for sale to fair market value related to our business unit in Mexico. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a $582.7 million impairment of goodwill, a $51.1 million impairment of fixed assets that are being held and used, a $1.5 million impairment of other intangible assets that are no longer being used, and a $86.8 million impairment of fixed assets to reduce the carrying value of assets held for sale to fair market value.\nReorganization items, net\nReorganization items primarily consist of $578.7 million gain on debt discharge partially offset by $299.6 million loss on fresh start accounting revaluations, $19.2 million write-off of deferred financing costs and debt premiums and discounts, and $15.2 million of professional fees incurred in connection with our emergence from voluntary reorganization.\nInterest expense, net of amounts capitalized\nInterest expense increased $1.8 million to $75.7 million (18.1% of revenues), for the combined year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $73.8 million (9.3% of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is primarily related to increased borrowings and interest rate under the new Term Loan Facility in the combined year ended December 31, 2016 and the write-off of the remaining $0.8 million of unamortized deferred financing costs related to a previously terminated credit facility in the second quarter of 2015.\nOther (income) loss, net\nDuring the combined year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized other income, net, of $2.4 million, compared to other loss, net, of $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. A $7.8 million allowance for the collectibility of our notes receivable related to the sale of our operations in Argentina was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2015. Our foreign exchange loss relates to U.S. dollar-denominated transactions in our foreign locations and fluctuations in exchange rates between local currencies and the U.S. dollar.\nThe table below presents comparative detailed information about combined other loss, net at December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Successor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Predecessor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(a) + (b) - (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Period from December 16, 2016 through December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Period from January 1, 2016 through December 15, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(407\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(159\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(268\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>169\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange loss\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,131\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(75\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for collectibility of notes receivable\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,705\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,041\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,305\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(701\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,443\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11,805\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(126\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome tax (expense) benefit\nOur income tax benefit was zero (0.0% effective rate) on pre-tax loss of $10.2 million and $2.8 million (2.2% effective rate) on pre-tax loss of $128.9 million for the period from December 16, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and for the period from January 1, 2016 through December 15, 2016, respectively, compared to an income tax benefit of $192.8 million (17.4% effective rate) on a pre-tax loss of $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our effective tax rates for such periods differ from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% due to a number of factors, including the mix of profit and loss between domestic and international taxing jurisdictions and the impact of permanent items, including goodwill impairment expense and expenses subject to statutorily imposed limitations such as meals and entertainment expenses, that affect book income but do not affect taxable income and discrete tax adjustments, such as valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and tax expense or benefit recognized for uncertain tax positions.\nYears Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>REVENUES\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>792,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,427,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(635,010\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(44\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>COSTS AND EXPENSES:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expenses\n</td> <td>714,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,059,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(345,014\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization expense\n</td> <td>180,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20,467\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>202,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>249,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(47,015\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment expense\n</td> <td>722,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>600,920\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>496\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss\n</td> <td>(1,027,309\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(203,875\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(823,434\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>404\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized\n</td> <td>73,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other loss, net\n</td> <td>9,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>831\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>(1,110,550\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(259,111\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(851,439\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>329\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit\n</td> <td>192,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NET LOSS\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(917,701\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(178,628\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(739,073\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>414\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our operating loss was $1.0 billion, compared to an operating loss of $203.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Loss per share was $5.86 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1.16 loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nRevenues\nOur revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased $635.0 million, or 44.5%, to $792.3 million from $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, due to lower spending from our customers as a result of lower oil prices. These market conditions resulted in reduced customer activity and a reduction in the price received for our services. Internationally, we had lower revenue as a result of reduced customer activity in Russia and Colombia and the exit of operations in the Middle East and South America.

December 31, 2016, compared to $377.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease for this segment is primarily due to lower spending from our customers as a result of lower oil prices. These market conditions resulted in reduced customer activity and a reduction in the price received for our services.\nOperating expenses for our U.S. Rig Services segment were $272.8 million during the combined year ended December 31, 2016, which represented a decrease of $412.3 million, or 60.2%, compared to $685.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. These expenses decreased primarily due to no impairment expense in 2016 compared to $297.7 million impairment expense in 2015 and as a result of a decrease in employee compensation costs and equipment expense as we sought to reduce our cost structure and as a result of lower activity levels.\nFluid Management Services\nRevenues for our Fluid Management Services segment decreased $73.9 million, or 48.3%, to $79.2 million for the combined year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $153.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

These expenses decreased primarily due to no impairment expense in 2016 compared to $24.5 million impairment expense in 2015 and as a result of a decrease in employee compensation costs and equipment expense as we sought to reduce our cost structure and as a result of lower activity levels.\nCoiled Tubing Services\nRevenues for our Coiled Tubing Services segment decreased $57.9 million, or 64.4%, to $32.0 million for the combined year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $89.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

These market conditions resulted in reduced customer activity and a reduction in the price received for our services.\nOperating expenses for our Coiled Tubing Services segment were $51.5 million during the combined year ended December 31, 2016, which represented a decrease of $193.5 million, or 79.0%, compared to $245.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. These expenses decreased primarily due to no impairment expense in 2016 compared to $82.7 million impairment of goodwill and a $51.1 million impairment of fixed assets in 2015 and as a result of a decrease in employee compensation costs, repair and maintenance expense and fuel costs as we sought to reduce our cost structure and as a result of lower activity levels.\nFishing and Rental Services\nRevenues for our Fishing and Rental Services segment decreased $62.7 million, or 51.4%, to $59.2 million for the combined year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $121.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

These market conditions resulted in reduced customer activity and a reduction in the price received for our services.\nOperating expenses for our Fishing and Rental Services segment were $85.9 million during the combined year ended December 31, 2016, which represented a decrease of $233.4 million, or 73.1%, compared to $319.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. These expenses decreased primarily due to no impairment expense in 2016 compared to $173.5 million impairment of goodwill and a $6.0 million impairment of intangible assets in 2015 and as a result of a decrease in employee compensation costs, repair and maintenance expense and fuel costs as we sought to reduce our cost structure and as a result of lower activity levels.\nInternational\nRevenues for our International segment decreased $34.9 million, or 69.3%, to $15.5 million for the combined year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $50.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower customer activity in Mexico and the exit of operations in the Middle East, South America.\nOperating expenses for our International segment decreased $158.2 million, or 68.0%, to $74.6 million for the combined year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $232.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. These expenses decreased primarily due to impairment expense of $44.6 million in 2016 compared to $80.8 million impairment of assets held for sale and a $4.4 million impairment of goodwill in 2015 and as a result of a decrease in employee compensation costs and equipment expense from lower activity and the exit of certain International markets.\nFunctional support\nOperating expenses for our Functional Support segment decreased $15.2 million, or 10.8%, to $125.6 million (30.1% of consolidated revenues) for the combined year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $140.8 million (17.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease is primarily due to lower employee compensation costs due to reduced staffing levels and $30.8 million lower expenses related to our FCPA investigations by the DOJ and the SEC, which concluded in April and August 2016, respectively, partially off-set by $25.8 million in professional fees related to corporate restructuring in 2016.\nYears Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nThe following table shows operating results for each of our reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015 Table 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>U.S. Rig Service\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fluid Management Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Coiled Tubing Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fishing and Rental Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Functional\nSupport\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues from external customers\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>377,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>792,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>685,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>244,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>319,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>232,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,819,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>(307,939\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(43,484\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(155,168\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(197,412\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(182,536\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(140,770\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,027,309\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>U.S. Rig Service\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fluid Management Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Coiled Tubing Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fishing and Rental Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Functional\nSupport\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues from external customers\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>679,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>249,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>173,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>212,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>112,740\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,427,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>582,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>246,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>184,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>271,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>178,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>168,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,631,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>96,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,819\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(58,944\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(65,432\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(168,394\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(203,875\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nU.S. Rig Services\nRevenues for our U.S. Rig Services segment decreased $301.9 million, or 44.5%, to $377.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $679.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease for this segment is primarily due to lower spending from our customers as a result of lower oil prices. These market conditions resulted in reduced customer activity and a reduction in the price received for our services.\nOperating expenses for our U.S. Rig Services segment were $685.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, which represented an increase of $102.4 million, or 17.6%, compared to $582.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. These expenses increased primarily as a result of a $297.7 million impairment of goodwill in 2015, partially offset by a decrease in employee compensation costs and equipment expense as we sought to reduce our cost structure and as a result of lower activity levels.\nFluid Management Services\nRevenues for our Fluid Management Services segment decreased $96.4 million, or 38.6%, to $153.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $249.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.

These expenses decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in equipment expense and employee compensation costs as we sought to reduce our cost structure and as a result of lower activity levels. This decrease was partially offset by a $24.5 million impairment of goodwill recorded in 2015.\nCoiled Tubing Services\nRevenues for our Coiled Tubing Services segment decreased $83.5 million, or 48.2%, to $89.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $173.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.

These expenses increased primarily as a result of a $173.5 million impairment of goodwill and a $6.0 million impairment of intangible assets in 2015 compared to a $62.1 impairment of fixed assets in 2014, partially offset by a decrease in employee compensation costs, repair and maintenance expense and fuel costs as we sought to reduce our cost structure and as a result of lower activity levels.\nInternational\nRevenues for our International segment decreased $62.4 million, or 55.4%, to $50.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $112.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower customer activity in Russia and Colombia and the exit of operations in the Middle East and South America.\nOperating expenses for our International segment increased $54.7 million, or 30.7%, to $232.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $178.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. These expenses increased primarily as a result of an increase in impairment of assets held for sale of $80.8 million and a $4.4 million impairment of goodwill in 2015 compared to a $22.4 million impairment of goodwill and $6.3 million impairment of intangible assets in 2014, partially offset by a decrease in employee compensation costs and equipment expense, primarily due to lower activity.\nFunctional support\nOperating expenses for our Functional Support segment decreased $27.6 million, or 16.4%, to $140.8 million (17.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $168.4 million (11.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease is primarily due to lower employee compensation costs due to reduced staffing levels and reduction in wages and $31.6 million related to our FCPA investigations in 2015 compared to $41.1 million in 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe require capital to fund our ongoing operations, including maintenance expenditures on our existing fleet and equipment, organic growth initiatives, investments and acquisitions, our debt service payments and our other obligations. We believe that our internally generated cash flows from operations, current reserves of cash and availability under our ABL Facility are sufficient to finance our cash requirements for current and future operations, budgeted capital expenditures, debt service and other obligations for the next twelve months.\nOil and natural gas prices began a rapid and substantial decline in the fourth quarter of 2014. Depressed commodity price conditions persisted and worsened during 2015 and remained depressed during 2016. As a result, demand for our products and services declined substantially, and the prices we are able to charge our customers for our products and services have also declined substantially. These trends materially and adversely affected our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition during 2016 and, unless conditions in our industry improve, this trend will continue during 2017 and potentially beyond.\nIn response to these conditions, we have undertaken several actions detailed below in an effort to preserve and improve our liquidity and financial position.\n \u2022 On December 15, 2016, the Company emerged from a pre-planned voluntary chapter 11 reorganization resulting in approximately $697 million of the Company's long-term debt being eliminated along with more than $45.6 million of annual interest expense going forward. \n \u2022 On December 15, 2016, we entered into our new $80 million ABL Facility (which was increased to $100 million on February 3, 2017) due June 15, 2021, and our new $250 million Term Loan Facility due December 15, 2021. As of December 31, 2016, we had no borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility and $38.5 million of letters of credit outstanding with borrowing capacity of $27.7 million available subject to covenant constraints under our ABL Facility. \n \u2022 In April 2015, we announced our decision to exit markets in which we participate outside of North America. Our strategy is to sell or relocate the assets of the businesses operating in these markets. As of December 31, 2015, we had sold our subsidiary in Bahrain and certain assets in Oman, Ecuador and Colombia and are no longer operating in these markets. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we completed the sale of our business in Mexico and we are currently in discussions to sell our business in Russia. \n \u2022 Beginning in the first quarter of 2015, we began a series of structural cost cutting changes at both corporate and field levels, which include fixed costs, supply-chain efficiencies and headcount and wage reductions. \nHowever, we still have substantial indebtedness and other obligations, and we may incur additional expenses that we are unable to predict at this time.\nOur ability to fund our operations, pay the principal and interest on our long-term debt and satisfy our other obligations will depend upon our available liquidity and the amount of cash flows we are able to generate from our operations. During 2016, our net cash used in operating activities was $138.4 million, and, if industry conditions do not improve, we may have negative cash flows from operations in 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our working capital was $117.8 million compared to $269.1 million as of December 31, 2015. Our working capital decreased during 2016 primarily as a result of repayment of long-term debt, decrease in accounts receivable and other current assets, which were partially offset by the receipt of cash proceeds from the rights offering as part of our restructuring and also by a decrease in accounts payable and other accrued expenses.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $90.5 million of cash, of which approximately $4.1 million was held in the bank accounts of our foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2016, $0.3 million of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries was held in U.S. bank accounts and denominated in U.S. dollars. We believe that the cash held by our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries could be repatriated for general corporate use without material withholdings.\nCash Flows\nCash used in operating activities was $0.4 million, $138.4 million, and $22.4 million for the periods from December 16, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and from January 1, 2016 through December 15, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively. Cash used by operating activities for these periods was primarily related to net loss adjusted for noncash items and payments of accounts payable and other accrued liabilities partially offset by cash inflows related to the collection of accounts receivable.\nCash used in investing activities was $0.3 million for the period from December 16, 2016 through December 31, 2016, and cash provided by investing activities was $6.5 million from January 1, 2016 through December 15, 2016, compared to cash of $19.4 million used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015. Investing cash inflows primarily relate to sales of assets during these periods. Investing cash outflows primarily relate to capital expenditures. Capital expenditures primarily relate to replacement assets for our existing fleet and equipment.\nCash provided by financing activities was $18.8 million and $218.7 million for the period from January 1, 2016 through December 15, 2016 and during the year ended December 31, 2015.

The ABL Facility provides for aggregate initial commitments from the ABL Lenders of $80 million, which, on February 3, 2017 was increased to $100 million, and matures on June 15, 2021.\nThe ABL Facility provides the ABL Borrowers with the ability to borrow up to an aggregate principal amount equal to the lesser of (i) the aggregate revolving commitments then in effect and (ii) the sum of (a) 85% of the value of eligible accounts receivable plus (b) 80% of the value of eligible unbilled accounts receivable, subject to a limit equal to the greater of (x) $35 million and (y) 25% of the Commitments. The amount that may be borrowed under the ABL Facility is subject to increase or reduction based on certain segregated cash or reserves provided for by the ABL Facility. In addition, the percentages of accounts receivable and unbilled accounts receivable included in the calculation described above is subject to reduction to the extent of certain bad debt write-downs and other dilutive items provided in the ABL Facility.\nBorrowings under the ABL Facility will bear interest, at the ABL Borrowers' option, at a per annum rate equal to (i) LIBOR for 30, 60, 90, 180, or, with the consent of the ABL Lenders, 360 days, plus an applicable margin that varies from 2.50% to 4.50% depending on the Borrowers' fixed charge coverage ratio at such time or (ii) a base rate equal to the sum of (a) the greatest of\n(x) the prime rate, (y) the federal funds rate, plus 0.50% or (z) 30-day LIBOR, plus 1.0% plus (b) an applicable margin that varies from 1.50% to 3.50% depending on the Borrowers' fixed charge coverage ratio at such time. In addition, the ABL Facility provides for unused line fees of 1.0% to 1.25% per year, depending on utilization, letter of credit fees and certain other factors.\nThe ABL Facility may in the future be guaranteed by certain of the Company's existing and future subsidiaries (the ABL Guarantors,\u201d and together with the ABL Borrowers, the ABL Loan Parties\u201d). To secure their obligations under the ABL Facility, each of the ABL Loan Parties has granted or will grant, as applicable, to the Administrative Agent a first-priority security interest for the benefit of the ABL Lenders in its present and future accounts receivable, inventory and related assets and proceeds of the foregoing (the ABL Priority Collateral\u201d). In addition, the obligations of the ABL Loan Parties under the ABL Facility are secured by second-priority liens on the Term Priority Collateral (as described below under Term Loan Facility\u201d).\nThe revolving loans under the ABL Facility may be voluntarily prepaid, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, subject to breakage or similar costs.\nThe ABL Facility contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that restrict the ability of the ABL Loan Parties to take certain actions including, among other things and subject to certain significant exceptions, the incurrence of debt, the granting of liens, the making of investments, entering into transactions with affiliates, the payment of dividends and the sale of assets. The ABL Facility also contains a requirement that the ABL Borrowers comply, during certain periods, with a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00 to 1.00.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had no borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility and $38.5 million of letters of credit outstanding with borrowing capacity of $27.7 million available subject to covenant constraints under our ABL Facility.\nTerm Loan Facility\nOn December 15, 2016, the Company entered into the Term Loan Facility among the Company, as borrower, certain subsidiaries of the Company named as guarantors therein, the financial institutions party thereto from time to time as Lenders (collectively, the Term Loan Lenders\u201d) and Cortland Capital Market Services LLC and Cortland Products Corp., as agent for the Term Loan Lenders. The Term Loan Facility had an outstanding principal amount of $250 million as of the Effective Date.\nThe Term Loan Facility will mature on December 15, 2021, although such maturity date may, at the Company's request, be extended by one or more of the Term Loan Lenders pursuant to the terms of the Term Loan Facility. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility will bear interest, at the Company's option, at a per annum rate equal to (i) LIBOR for one, two, three, six, or, with the consent of the Term Loan Lenders, 12 months, plus 10.25% or (ii) a base rate equal to the sum of (a) the greatest of (x) the prime rate, (y) the Federal Funds rate, plus 0.50% and (z) 30-day LIBOR, plus 1.0% plus (b) 9.25%.\nThe Term Loan Facility is guaranteed by certain of the Company's existing and future subsidiaries (the Term Loan Guarantors,\u201d and together with the Company, the Term Loan Parties\u201d). To secure their obligations under the Term Loan Facility, each of the Term Loan Parties has granted or will grant, as applicable, to the agent a first-priority security interest for the benefit of the Term Loan Lenders in substantially all of each Term Loan Party's assets other than certain excluded assets and the ABL Priority Collateral (the Term Priority Collateral\u201d). In addition, the obligations of the Term Loan Parties under the Term Loan Facility are secured by second-priority liens on the ABL Priority Collateral (as described above under ABL Facility\u201d).\nThe loans under the Term Loan Facility may be prepaid at the Company's option, subject to the payment of a prepayment premium in certain circumstances as provided in the Term Loan Facility. If a prepayment is made prior to the first anniversary of the loan, such prepayment must be made with make-whole amount with the calculation of the make-whole amount as specified in the Term Loan Facility. If a prepayment is made after the first anniversary of the loan but prior to the second anniversary, such prepayment must be made at 106% of the principle amount, if a prepayment is made after the second anniversary but prior to the third anniversary, such prepayment must be made at 103% of the principle amount. After the third anniversary, if a prepayment is made, no prepayment premium is due. The Company is required to make principal payments in the amount of $625,000 per quarter commencing with the quarter ending March 31, 2017. In addition, pursuant to the Term Loan Facility, the Company must prepay or offer to prepay, as applicable, term loans with the net cash proceeds of certain debt incurrences and asset sales, excess cash flow, and upon certain change of control transactions, subject in each case to certain exceptions.\nThe Term Loan Facility contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that restrict the ability of the Term Loan Parties to take certain actions including, among other things and subject to certain significant exceptions, the incurrence of debt, the granting of liens, the making of investments, entering into transactions with affiliates, the payment of dividends and the sale of assets. The Term Loan Facility also contains financial covenants requiring that the Company maintain an asset coverage ratio of at least 1.35 to 1.0 and that Liquidity (as defined in the Term Loan Facility) must not be less than $37.5 million (of which at least $20.0 million must be in cash or cash equivalents held in deposit accounts) as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, subject to certain exceptions and cure rights.\nLetter of Credit Facility\nOn November 7, 2013, we entered into an uncommitted, unsecured $15.0 million letter of credit facility to be used solely for the"}
