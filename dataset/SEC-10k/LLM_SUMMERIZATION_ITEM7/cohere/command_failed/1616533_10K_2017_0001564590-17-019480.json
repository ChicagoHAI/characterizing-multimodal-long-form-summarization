Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report. See also Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this report.\nWe use a 52- to 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Friday in August. Unless the context indicates otherwise, whenever we refer in this report to a particular year, with respect to ourselves, we mean the fiscal year ending in that particular calendar year. Financial information for two of our subsidiaries SMART Brazil and SMART do Brazil is included in our consolidated financial statements on a one-month lag because their fiscal years begin August 1 and end July 31.\nOverview\nWe are a global leader in specialty memory solutions, serving the electronics industry for over 25 years. As part of our global business, we have established a leading market position, as measured by market share, in Brazil as the largest in-country manufacturer of memory for desktops, notebooks and servers, as well as mobile memory for smartphones. We also have a leading market position worldwide, as measured by revenue, in specialty memory where we work closely with OEM customers to develop memory solutions, which incorporate customer-specific requirements. We believe our customers rely on us as a strategic supplier due to our customer specific designs, product quality and technical support, our global footprint and, in Brazil, our ability to provide locally manufactured memory products. We also provide customized, integrated supply chain services to certain OEM customers to assist them in the management and execution of their procurement processes.\nOur business was originally founded in 1988 as SMART Modular, which became a publicly traded company in 1995. In 1999, SMART Modular was acquired by Solectron and operated as its subsidiary. In 2002, we acquired a memory module manufacturing company in Brazil to expand our global footprint and our manufacturing capabilities. In 2004, a group of private equity investors acquired our business from Solectron, and we began to operate our business as SMART Worldwide. SMART Worldwide became a publicly traded company in 2006 and operated independently until it was acquired by investment funds affiliated with Silver Lake Partners and Silver Lake Sumeru (collectively Silver Lake\u201d) in August 2011 (the Acquisition\u201d).\nIn May 2017, we completed our IPO in which we issued and sold 6,095,000 ordinary shares, including 795,000 ordinary shares sold pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option, at a price of $11.00 per share. We received aggregate proceeds of $63.5 million from the sale of ordinary shares, net of underwriters' discounts and commissions, but before deducting offering expenses of approximately $2.7 million. In June 2017, we used the net proceeds to make a mandatory prepayment of $61.1 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding term loans under the Amended Credit Agreement.\nSince 2002, when we commenced our operations in Brazil, we have invested over $170 million to build and improve our advanced manufacturing facilities and have assembled and trained a staff of over 480 employees, who comprise many of the leading semiconductor technology professionals in the country. In Brazil, we process imported wafers and cut, package and test them to create memory components used to manufacture modules and other memory and Flash-based products. We are the only company engaged in packaging and test for mobile memory for smartphones in Brazil. We have a strategic, long-term relationship with a global memory wafer supplier that has provided us with a stable source of competitively priced wafers for the Brazilian market and provides our supplier with access to that market through our in-country infrastructure and capabilities.\nOur business in Brazil has historically focused on DRAM components and modules for desktops, notebooks and servers, where local content and tax regulations provide substantial financial incentives to our customers to procure locally manufactured memory products, particularly when they are made with locally processed components. We have leveraged our experience and success in these markets to expand into mobile memory, primarily for smartphones, which include eMMC and eMCP, where additional local content requirements and tax\nincentives have been introduced. In fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, these mobile memory products accounted for 67%, 65% and 29%, respectively, of our net sales in Brazil. Based on industry data of expected unit sales for mobile phones in Brazil and taking into account our average selling price of approximately $19.80 per eMCP for mobile memory during the full fiscal year 2017, we believe that the total addressable market for locally produced mobile memory for mobile phones in Brazil will reach approximately $580 million by 2019. We have demonstrated our ability to service the smartphone market in Brazil as we are now qualified at seven of the top ten mobile vendors in Brazil representing, according to industry data, over 85% of the mobile phones sold in Brazil in calendar 2016. With local content requirements for various IT products increasing, we believe that our local manufacturing capabilities provide a valuable and differentiated offering to our OEM customers in Brazil. We also believe that our long-term relationships with many of these customers as the largest supplier of locally manufactured memory products provides us with visibility for our Brazilian business.\nWe began participating in Brazil's PPB/IT Program in February 2011. The PPB/IT Program is intended to promote local content by allowing qualified PPB/IT Program companies to sell certain IT products with a reduced rate of IPI as compared to the rate that is required to be collected by non-qualified suppliers. The PPB/IT Program provides an incentive for certain customers to purchase from us because our sales will not be subject to the regular level of IPI. In order to receive the intended treatment as a PPB/IT Program supplier, our subsidiary SMART do Brazil is required to invest in research and development activities conducted in Brazil in an amount equal to 3% of its gross annual sales revenues reduced by the following: the cost of raw materials qualified as products eligible for the PPB/IT Program, including the ICs that are purchased from our other Brazilian subsidiary, SMART Brazil, and that are used to make memory modules; applicable sales taxes; the value of products exported out of Brazil; and the value of products shipped to the Manaus Free Trade Zone. In August 2014, the government of Brazil enacted legislation extending the PPB/IT Program until 2029 and maintaining the required research and development investment with respect to DRAM modules at 3.00% of adjusted sales through 2029, repealing the previously approved increases to 3.75% in 2015 and 3.50% in 2016 through 2019.\nIn 2013, the EU, later joined by Japan, requested the establishment of a panel within the WTO to determine whether certain measures enacted by the Brazilian government concerning tax incentives and local content requirements for the automotive and several other industries including the IT industry and including PADIS, the PPB/IT Program and Lei do Bem, are inconsistent with WTO rules. In December 2016, the WTO circulated its report to the parties. This report was released to the public on August 30, 2017. In its report, the panel concluded, among other things, that the tax exemptions, reductions and suspensions granted for the automotive, IT and other industries amount to subsidies that are inconsistent with the principles of the various WTO agreements, and the panel recommended that Brazil withdraw these subsidies. Government officials in Brazil have expressed their intent, if necessary, to restructure the incentives to be consistent with the WTO principles and to continue to support local industry, however, there can be no assurance that the programs will ultimately be restructured and implemented or, if implemented, whether the restructured programs will provide the same level of support as is currently in place. Brazil has notified the WTO of its decision to appeal the panel's findings. While we cannot predict the impact of the WTO's report, this recommendation could result in significant adverse changes to the local content rules and incentives available to us and our customers in Brazil. Any suspension, early termination or other adverse change in the local content requirements could significantly reduce the demand for, and the profit margins on, our products in Brazil, and would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA major corruption scandal involving Brazil's largest energy company, Petrobras, began to unfold in 2014, and by 2015 contributed to a significant decrease in the value of the Brazilian real, which in turn led to a substantial downturn in the Brazilian economy and a substantial rise in unemployment. Our net sales in Brazil decreased from $407.4 million in fiscal 2014 to $245.5 million in fiscal 2016. While economic conditions in Brazil remain challenging, the value of the Brazilian real has strengthened in recent periods, and our net sales in Brazil increased to $398.4 million in fiscal 2017.\nIn our specialty memory solutions business, we offer an extensive portfolio of over 2,000 products, which includes all generations of DRAM, as well as embedded and removable Flash, enterprise memory and hybrid volatile and non-volatile memory solutions. We also offer customized, integrated supply chain services to enable our customers to manage supply chain planning and execution, which reduces costs and increases productivity. Our supply chain services are based on our proprietary software platform that we develop and are integrated with our customers' respective procurement management systems as well as our suppliers' distribution management systems.\nWe generated net sales of $761.3 million, $534.4 million and $643.5 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our net sales grew 42% in fiscal 2017 over fiscal 2016 and decreased 17% in fiscal 2016 over fiscal 2015. Our net loss was $7.8 million, $20.0 million and $46.5 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our income (loss) from operations was $53.9 million in fiscal 2017, $6.2 million in fiscal 2016 and ($6.7) million in fiscal 2015.\nOur global, diversified customer base includes over 250 end customers, such as Cisco, Samsung, HPE, Dell and LG. Our top ten end customers, five of which have been our end customers for over a decade, accounted for 84% of our net sales, including sales to contract manufacturers or ODMs at the direction of such end customers, in fiscal 2017. Of our end customers, Samsung accounted for 19%, 13% and 11% of net sales in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively; Cisco accounted for 15%, 19% and 16% of net sales in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively; Lenovo accounted for 11% and 13% of net sales in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively; Dell accounted for 15% of net sales in fiscal 2015; and HP accounted for 14% of net sales in fiscal 2015 (in fiscal 2016, HP undertook a spin-off and divided into two distinct companies, following which neither company accounted for 10% or more of our net sales). Direct sales to Samsung accounted for 19%, 13% and 11% of net sales in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively; direct sales to Flex accounted for 14% and 17% of net sales in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively; direct sales to Hon Hai accounted for 13%, 11% and 11% of net sales in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively; and direct sales to Dell accounted for 15% of net sales in fiscal 2015. During these periods, no other customers accounted for more than 10% of our net sales. Of the $761.3 million of net sales in fiscal 2017, 52% were generated in Brazil, 23% were generated in Asia, 21% were generated in North America and 4% were generated in Europe. Of the $534.4 million of net sales in fiscal 2016, 46% were generated in Brazil, 26% were generated in Asia, 23% were generated in North America and 5% were generated in Europe. For further geographic information regarding our net sales and property and equipment, net, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.\nComponents of Operating Results\nNet Sales\nWe generate product revenues predominantly from sales of our memory solutions, including memory modules, Flash memory cards and other solid state storage products, principally to OEMs that compete in the computing, networking, communications, storage, aerospace, defense, mobile and industrial markets. Sales of our products are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders and are not based on long-term supply agreements. We generate service revenue by providing procurement, logistics, inventory management, temporary warehousing, kitting and packaging services. Our net sales are dependent upon demand in the end markets for our customers' products and fluctuations in end-user demand can have a rapid and material effect on our net sales. Furthermore, sales to relatively few customers have accounted for, and we expect for the foreseeable future will continue to account for, a significant percentage of our net sales.\nCost of Sales\nThe most significant components of cost of sales are materials, fixed manufacturing costs, labor, depreciation, freight and customs charges. Increases in capital expenditures may increase our future cost of sales due to higher levels of depreciation expense. Cost of sales also includes any inventory write-downs. We have in the past, and may in the future, write down inventory for a variety of reasons, including obsolescence, excess quantities and declines in market value below our cost. A significant percentage of our cost of sales consists of the cost of DRAM and Flash components and wafers. While we have historically received competitive pricing and have had consistent sources of supply for these supplies, we do not have agreements that provide us with fixed pricing or guarantees of supply. Increases in DRAM pricing typically improve our margins, at least in the short term and particularly in our operations in Brazil, as we consume previously purchased inventory. However, declines in DRAM pricing often require us to reduce our prices even as we consume higher priced DRAM inventory, thereby reducing our margins.\nGross Profit\nGross profit and gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the average sales prices of our products, manufacturing and overhead costs, the mix of products sold and our ability to leverage our existing infrastructure as we continue to grow. We expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time depending on the factors described above.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of research and development expense, selling, general and administrative expense and management advisory fees. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses.\nResearch and development expense. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs, consulting costs, allocated overhead and other costs to support our development activities. To date, we have expensed all research and development costs as incurred. We expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our research and product development efforts to enhance our product capabilities and access new customer markets, although such expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total net sales. In order to qualify for certain tax incentives under PADIS and PPB/IT Program in Brazil, we are required to expend a minimum amount on research and development in Brazil.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs, sales commission costs and allocated overhead. We expense sales commission costs as incurred. Sales and marketing expense also includes costs for recruiting and training channel partners, market development programs, promotional and other marketing activities, travel, office equipment and outside consulting costs. We expect sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our sales and marketing headcount in all markets and expand our international operations, although such expense may fluctuate as a percentage of net sales.\nGeneral and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs, facilities and non-manufacturing equipment costs, allowances for bad debt and other support costs, including utilities, insurance and professional fees. We expect that we will incur increased general and administrative expenses as a result of being a publicly-traded company, including significant increased legal and accounting costs related to compliance with rules and regulations implemented by the SEC and NASDAQ, as well as additional insurance, investor relations and other costs associated with being a public company.\nManagement advisory fees. Management advisory fees consist of quarterly fees plus out-of-pocket expenses, which are payable by us to Silver Lake Management Company III, L.L.C. and Silver Lake Management Company Sumeru, L.L.C., affiliates of Silver Lake, or the Managers, under the Amended and Restated Transaction and Management Fee Agreement, or the Management Agreement. We terminated the Management Agreement upon the completion of our initial public offering.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net consists primarily of interest expense on our debt obligations.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net includes gains and losses from foreign currency transactions and other non-operating items.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nWe record income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, we generally consider all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates. We provide valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nWe recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. We then measure the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. In the event that we recognize any unrecognized tax benefits, the effective tax rate will be affected. If recognized, approximately $1.5 million of unrecognized tax benefit would impact the effective tax rate at August 25, 2017. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, we cannot assure that the final tax outcome of these matters will be the same as these estimates. We update these estimates quarterly based on factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, new audit activity and effectively settled issues.\nWe follow specific and detailed guidelines in each tax jurisdiction regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide necessary valuation allowances as required. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the tax law. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and our ability to successfully execute our business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.\nResults of Operations\nThe following is a summary of our results of operations for the periods presented. The period-to-period comparison of results is not necessarily indicative of results for future periods.\nTable 171: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td>

or 42.5%, during fiscal 2017 compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to a 67% higher sales volume of mobile memory products in Brazil in fiscal 2017, which was driven in part by new product introductions of higher density eMCP products and the increase in local content requirements to 50% for mobile memory products for smartphones effective January 1, 2017, as well as a 36% increase in the average selling prices of mobile memory products in Brazil during fiscal 2017 due to density changes. Strategic investments to increase production capacity in prior periods helped enable us to meet the increased demand in the Brazil mobile memory market. Our Brazil PC DRAM and our specialty DRAM sales also increased and were positively impacted by overall strength in the worldwide DRAM market, leading to 53% and 44% higher volumes and 6% and 24% increases in the average selling prices during fiscal 2017, respectively, compared to the prior fiscal year, as well as strength in the server, networking, communications and storage markets.\nCost of sales increased by $171.6 million, or 40.1%, during fiscal 2017 compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase of 43% in the cost of materials for the higher level of sales, as well as higher depreciation in Brazil due to the technology transition from third generation double-data-rate ( DDR3\u201d) Fine-pitch Ball Grid Array ( FBGA\u201d) packaging to fourth generation double-data-rate ( DDR4\u201d) flip chip and higher production costs related to the increased revenue. Included in the cost of sales increase was an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $5.4 million due to locally sourced cost of sales in Brazil.\nGross margin increased to 21.3% during fiscal 2017, compared to 20.0% for fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher Brazil mobile memory and specialty DRAM revenue while cost of sales associated with higher density memory modules increased at a lower rate.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 174: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>

The decrease in net sales was primarily due to 47% lower volume and 32% lower average selling prices of our DRAM products in Brazil due in large part to a major corruption scandal involving Brazil's largest energy company, Petrobras, which began to unfold in calendar 2014, and by calendar 2015 contributed to a significant decrease in the value of the Brazilian real. This led to a substantial downturn in the Brazilian economy toward the end of fiscal 2015, which continued into fiscal 2016. The decrease in net sales was offset in part by a 79% increase in average selling prices and a 15% increase in volume for our mobile memory products in Brazil, as local content requirements for mobile memory products for smartphones increased from 25% to 40% effective January 1, 2016. In addition, our net sales were also negatively impacted by lower worldwide DRAM prices, leading to a 23% decrease in our average selling prices of our specialty DRAM products in fiscal 2016, partially offset by 10% higher volume.\nCost of sales decreased by $84.5 million, or 16.5%, during fiscal 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease in cost of sales was driven primarily by a $73.4 million decrease in the cost of materials due to lower sales. In addition, our factory overhead and other components of cost of sales decreased by $11.1 million, primarily due to lower production costs, personnel-related expenses and depreciation as well as charges for inventory reserves. The cost of sales decrease is net of an offsetting favorable foreign exchange impact of $10.7 million due to locally sourced cost of sales in Brazil. Gross margin remained relatively flat for both periods.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td>

the prior fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to decreased spending as a result of the deteriorating economic conditions in Brazil, lower intangible amortization expense as certain intangible assets were fully amortized in fiscal 2015, as well as an in-process research and development charge of $1.6 million in fiscal 2015, which did not recur in fiscal 2016. Included in the R&D expense decrease was a favorable foreign exchange impact of $3.4 million.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expense decreased by $31.7 million, or 35.6%, during fiscal 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $16.2 million in intangible amortization expense related to assets that were fully amortized in fiscal 2015, lower professional services and personnel-related costs, aggregating $8.9 million, as well as a non-recurring write-off of $4.0 million of deferred public offering costs in fiscal 2015.

Other income (expense), net increased by $7.4 million during fiscal 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily due to an $11.8 million currency gain (mainly in Brazil) arising from transactions not denominated in the functional currency, partially offset by a $4.3 million decrease in fees received in fiscal 2015 under a transition services agreement that we entered into with SanDisk in connection with the sale of the Storage Business as this agreement terminated in fiscal 2015.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> August 26,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> August 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (4,205\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (63.2\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProvision for income taxes decreased by $4.2 million, or 63.2%, during fiscal 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to lower foreign income in certain taxable jurisdictions.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> August 25,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> August 26,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> August 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (933\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,762\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18,027\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13,369\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,716\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16,975\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10,914\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (32,645\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and\ncash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (263\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (227\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,399\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (36,198\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (9,460\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (9,998\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt August 25, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $22.4 million, of which approximately $14.8 million was held outside of the United States.\nOn May 30, 2017, we completed our IPO and raised proceeds, net of underwriting commissions and discounts and other offering costs, of approximately $60.8 million. On June 2, 2017, we used the net proceeds to make a mandatory prepayment of $61.1 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding term loans under the Amended Credit Agreement.\nWe expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents, line of credit and cash generated by operating activities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. Our principal uses of cash and capital resources are debt service requirements as described below, capital expenditures, R&D expenditures and working capital requirements. We expect that future capital expenditures will focus on expanding capacity of our Brazilian operations, expanding our R&D activities, manufacturing equipment upgrades and/or acquisitions and IT infrastructure and software upgrades. Cash and cash equivalents consist of funds held in demand deposit accounts and money market funds. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.\nOperating Activities\nDuring the fiscal 2017, cash used in operating activities was $0.9 million. The primary factors affecting our cash flows during this period were a $61.2 million change in our net operating assets and liabilities and $7.8 million net loss, partially offset by $68.1 million of non-cash related expenses. The $61.2 million change in net operating assets and liabilities consisted of increases of $40.4 million in accounts receivable and $21.9 million in inventory, and decrease of $10.6 million in accounts payable, offset by an increase of $11.7 million in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The increase in accounts receivable was due to lower purchases under our Receivables Purchasing Agreement, while the increase in inventory was due to both higher sales forecast and higher cost of materials resulting from increased DRAM prices.\nDuring fiscal 2016, cash provided by operating activities was $15.1 million. The primary factors affecting our cash flows during this period were $38.6 million of non-cash related expenses, offset by a $20.0 million net loss and a $3.5 million change in our net operating assets and liabilities. The $3.5 million change in operating assets and liabilities consisted of decreases of $44.9 million in accounts receivable, $31.3 million in inventory and $11.0 million in prepaid expenses and other assets, offset by decreases of $86.5 million in accounts payable and $4.2 million in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The decreases in accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable were primarily due to lower gross sales.\nDuring fiscal 2015, cash provided by operating activities was $40.8 million. The primary factors affecting our cash flows during this period were $64.2 million of non-cash related expenses and a $23.1 million change in our net operating assets and liabilities, offset by a $46.5 million net loss. The $23.1 million change in operating assets and liabilities consisted of a decrease of $8.6 million in accounts receivable and an increase of $53.2 million in accounts payable, offset by increases of $20.0 million in inventory and $0.4 million in prepaid expenses and other assets, and a decrease of $18.3 million in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The increases in inventory and accounts payable were primarily due to higher gross sales.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2017 was $18.0 million consisting primarily of $18.7 million used for purchases of property and equipment, offset by $0.7 million proceeds from sale of property and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2016 was $13.4 million consisting primarily of $13.8 million used for purchases of property and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2015 was $8.7 million, primarily resulting from $31.7 million used for purchases of property and equipment, $6.1 million of restricted cash related to our BNDES Credit Agreements in Brazil and $1.6 million used to purchase other assets, offset by $30.5 million of proceeds from the Escrow Release related to the sale of our Storage Business.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2017 was $17.0 million, consisting of $151.9 million payment for extinguishment of long-term debt and debt extension, $61.1 million early payment on term loan, $19.7 million long-term debt payments for both the Amended Credit Agreement and the BNDES Credit Agreements, as well as $3.2 million fees paid for revolver, offset by $157.0 million proceeds from issuance of long-term debt and $62.4 million proceeds from IPO. Net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2016 was $10.9 million, consisting primarily of $16.7 million of long-term debt payments, offset by $5.8 million received under our BNDES Credit Agreements in Brazil. Net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2015 was $32.6 million, consisting primarily of $28.3 million for distribution of share premium to our shareholders in connection with the Escrow Release, $13.3 million of long-term debt payments, $3.1 million for payment of costs related to our IPO, $1.1 million of payments for the cancellation of options related to the Escrow Release and $0.9 million for strike price floor payments to optionholders as equitable adjustments required under the SGH Plan in connection with the Escrow Release, offset by $14.1 million received under our BNDES Credit Agreements in Brazil.\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations as of August 25, 2017 are set forth below:\nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amended Credit Agreement Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 115.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 165.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense in connection with the Amended\nCredit Agreement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BNDES Credit Agreements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense in connection with the BNDES\nCredit Agreements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cancellable product purchase commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 110.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 71.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 134.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 315.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSenior Secured Credit Agreement\nOn August 9, 2017, SMART Worldwide, SMART Modular Technologies (Global), Inc. (Global) and SMART Modular entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (together with all related documents, as amended from time to time, the Amended Credit Agreement) with certain lenders which amended and restated that certain Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as November 5, 2016 (the ARCA), which had amended and restated that certain Credit Agreement dated as of August 26, 2011 (the Original Credit Agreement). The Company's subsidiaries named as borrowers in the Amended Credit Agreement and certain other subsidiaries that entered into a guarantee with respect to the Amended Credit Agreement, are collectively referred to as the Loan Parties and together with SMART Malaysia, the Credit Group. The Amended Credit Agreement provides for $165 million of term loans with a maturity date of August 9, 2022 and $50 million of revolving loans with a maturity date of February 9, 2021 (the Initial Revolver Maturity Date) which revolving loan maturity date automatically extends to February 9, 2022 if the total leverage ratio of the Credit Group is less than 3.0:1.0 on the Initial Revolver Maturity Date. SMART Global Holding is not a party to the Amended Credit Agreement.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement is jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior basis by certain subsidiaries of Global (excluding, among other subsidiaries, SMART Malaysia). In addition, the Amended Credit Agreement is secured by a pledge of the capital stock of, or equity interests in, most of the subsidiaries of SMART Worldwide (including, without limitation, SMART Malaysia) and by substantially all of the assets of the subsidiaries of SMART Worldwide, excluding the assets of SMART Malaysia and certain other subsidiaries.\nCovenants. The Amended Credit Agreement contains various representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants that are usual and customary for loans of this nature including, among other things, limitations on the Credit Group's ability to engage in certain transactions, incur debt, pay dividends, and make investments. The Amended Credit Agreement also requires that the Credit Group maintain a Secured Leverage Ratio not in excess of 3.5:1.0 as of the end of each fiscal quarter (commencing with the fiscal quarter ending November 24, 2017) and puts restrictions on the Credit Group's ability to retain cash proceeds from the sale of certain assets with net proceeds in excess of $2 million, subject to customary six-month reinvestment rights.\nInterest and Interest Rates. Loans under the Amended Credit Agreement accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin plus, at the borrowers' option, either a LIBOR rate, or a base rate. The applicable margin for term loans with respect to LIBOR borrowings is 6.25% and with respect to base rate borrowings is 5.25%. The interest rate on the term loans was 7.57%, 8.25% and 8.25% as of August 25, 2017, August 26, 2016, and August 28, 2015 respectively.\nThe applicable margin for revolving loans adjusts every quarter based on the Secured Leverage Ratio for the most recent fiscal quarter with the applicable margin for revolving loans with respect to LIBOR borrowings ranging from 3.75% to 4.00% and the applicable margin for revolving loans with respect to base rate borrowings ranging from 2.75% to 3.00%. Prior to November 5, 2016, the effective date of the ARCA, the applicable margin was pegged to the Secured Net Leverage Ratio.\nInterest on base rate loans is payable on the last day of each calendar quarter. Interest on LIBOR-based loans is payable every one, two, three, six, nine or twelve months after the date of each borrowing, dependent on the particular interest rate period selected with respect to such borrowing.\nPrincipal Payments. The Amended Credit Agreement requires quarterly repayments of principal under the term loans equal to 2.5% of $165 million, or $4.1 million per fiscal quarter. During fiscal 2017 and 2016, the borrowers made scheduled principal payments of $11.6 million and $13.3 million, respectively.\nPrepayments. The borrowers have the right at any time to make optional prepayments of the principal amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement, provided that prepayments of principal which are voluntary or are made in connection with certain transactions will be subject to prepayment premiums of 3%, 2% and 1% during the first, second and third years, respectively, after the effective date of the Amended Credit Agreement.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement also requires certain mandatory prepayments of principal whereby the borrowers must prepay outstanding loans, subject to certain exceptions, which include, among other things:\nTable 184: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 75% of excess cash flow on a semi-annual basis if the total leverage ratio is greater than 1.5:1.0, (ii) 50% of excess cash flow on a semi-annual basis if the total leverage ratio is greater than 1.0:1.0 but less than or equal to 1.5:1.0 and (iii) 25% of excess cash flow on an annual basis if the secured leverage ratio is less than or equal to 1.0:1.0., which amounts will be reduced by any permitted voluntary prepayments of principal made in the applicable fiscal year;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 100% of the net proceeds of certain asset sales or other dispositions of property of Global or any of its restricted subsidiaries, subject to limited rights to reinvest the proceeds within six months; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 100% of the net cash proceeds of incurrence of certain debt by Global or any of its restricted subsidiaries, other than proceeds from certain debt to be incurred under the Amended Credit Agreement.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNo mandatory prepayments were required for fiscal 2017.\nOn November 29, 2016, the Credit Group received all required approvals from the lenders and entered into Amendment No. 4 to the Credit Agreement (Amendment 4) dated as of November 5, 2016 (the Amendment 4 Effective Date) which, among other things, adopted the ARCA. Pursuant to Amendment 4, the borrowers agreed to pay the Administrative Agent a fee in the amount of $1 million pursuant to a separate agreement and to pay a fee in the form of an additional term loan, in the amount of $5 million for the ratable account of the term lenders party to Amendment 4. Additionally, SMART Global Holdings was obligated to make an aggregate equity investment of at least $9.9 million in cash in Global, and SMART Global Holdings was obligated to issue 3,467,571 warrants (the\nLender Warrants) to purchase 20% on a pro forma basis, of the then outstanding ordinary shares of SMART Global Holdings, to the term lenders party to Amendment 4, which Lender Warrants were exercisable at $0.03 per share, with 1,541,143 warrants totaling 10% of SMART Global Holdings' then outstanding shares (the First Tranche Warrants) exercisable immediately and 1,926,428 warrants to purchase an additional 10% of SMART Global Holdings' then outstanding shares (the Second Tranche Warrants), exercisable only if there were balances outstanding under the original term loans at the one year anniversary of the Amendment 4 Effective Date. The relative fair value of the Lender Warrants and the fees payable to the lenders in connection with the ARCA were recorded as debt discount and resulted in additional interest expense over the then amended term of the loan using the effective interest method following debt modification accounting.\nUnder the terms of the ARCA, the maturity date of the term loans and the revolving loans was extended from August 26, 2017, to August 26, 2019. If there were balances still outstanding on the original term loans at the one year anniversary of the Amendment 4 Effective Date, the borrowers would have been obligated to pay an additional fee to the term lenders of $5 million in cash. In addition, the ARCA increased the quarterly scheduled principal payments of term loans to $3.9 million per quarter to be paid on the last day of each fiscal quarter starting November 25, 2016. Under the ARCA, early mandatory repayments of principle were applied in the reverse order of maturity.\nOn June 2, 2017, SMART Global Holdings contributed $61.0 million from the proceeds of the IPO, to Global which proceeds Global in turn used to pay down the original term loans as required under the ARCA, resulted in a $6.7 million loss on early repayment of long-term debt. As of August 9, 2017, prior to the one year anniversary of the Amendment 4 Effective Date, the Credit Group entered into the Amended Credit Agreement with new term loans in the aggregate principal amount of $165 million with different lenders and the Second Tranche Warrants were terminated. The proceeds from the Amended Credit Agreement were used to fully repay and refinance the term loans under the ARCA in the principal amount of $151.0 million, which resulted in a write off of $15.2 million of original issue discount and debt issuance costs as an extinguishment loss.\nTerm loans under the Amended Credit Agreement were issued at a discount of 2.0% of the then outstanding principal amount of $165 million, for a discount of $3.3 million. The Company incurred $8.7 million debt issuance costs upon entering into the Amended Credit Agreement, of which $5.3 million was attributable to the term loans and recorded as a direct reduction to the face amount of the term loans, and $3.4 million was allocated to the revolving line of credit and recorded as a separate asset on the balance sheet. Debt issuance costs and debt discount related to term loans are being amortized to interest expense based on the effective interest rate method over the life of the term loans. Those fees allocated to the revolving line of credit are being amortized to interest expense ratably over the life of the revolving line of credit.\nAs of August 25, 2017, the outstanding principal balance of term loans under the Amended Credit Agreement was $165.0 million and there were no outstanding revolving loans. As of August 26, 2016, the outstanding principal balance of term loans under the credit agreement then in effect was $218.8 million and there were no outstanding revolving loans.\nBNDES Credit Agreements\nIn December 2013, SMART Brazil, entered into a credit facility with the Brazilian Development Bank, or BNDES (such loan the BNDES 2013 Credit Agreement). Under the BNDES 2013 Credit Agreement, a total of R$50.6 million (or $16.2 million) was made available to SMART Brazil for investments in infrastructure, research and development conducted in Brazil and acquisitions of equipment not otherwise available in the Brazilian domestic market. SMART Brazil's obligations under the BNDES 2013 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Banco Ita\u00fa BBA S.A., or Ita\u00fa Bank, which guarantee is in turn secured by a guarantee from SMART Brazil and SMART do Brazil and a commitment by SMART Brazil to maintain minimum cash balances with Ita\u00fa Bank equal to 11.85% of the maximum aggregate balance of principal, interest and fees outstanding under the BNDES 2013 Credit Agreement. As of both August 25, 2017 and August 26, 2016, the committed amount was R$6.0 million (or $1.9 million), which is shown on the Company's consolidated balance sheets as restricted cash in other noncurrent assets.\nApproximately half of the available debt under the BNDES 2013 Credit Agreement accrues interest at a fixed rate while the other half accrues interest at a floating rate. The facility under the BNDES 2013 Credit Agreement is a\nterm loan fully amortizing in 48 equal monthly installments beginning on August 15, 2015 with the final principal payment being due on July 15, 2019.\nAs of August 25, 2017, SMART Brazil's outstanding debt under the BNDES 2013 Credit Agreement was R$25.6 million (or $8.2 million), of which R$12.6 million (or $4.0 million) accrues interest at the fixed rate of 3.5% and R$13.0 million (or $4.2 million) of the debt accrues interest at the floating rate of 0.5% above the TJLP rate published by the Central Bank of Brazil, or BZTJLP (5.0%), combined corresponding to an overall effective interest rate of 5.5% per annum. As of August 26, 2016, SMART Brazil's outstanding debt under the BNDES 2013 Credit Agreement was R$38.2 million (or $11.8 million), of which R$18.9 million (or $5.8 million) accrues interest at the fixed rate of 3.5% and R$19.3 million (or $6.0 million) of the debt accrues interest at the floating rate of 0.5% above the TJLP rate published by the Central Bank of Brazil, or BZTJLP (5.0%), combined corresponding to an overall effective interest rate of 5.5% per annum.\nIn December 2014, SMART Brazil, entered into a second credit facility with BNDES, referred to as the BNDES 2014 Credit Agreement. The BNDES 2013 Credit Agreement and the BNDES 2014 Credit Agreement are collectively referred to as the BNDES Agreements. Under the BNDES 2014 Credit Agreement, a total of R$52.8 million (or $16.9 million) was made available to SMART Brazil for research and development conducted in Brazil related to integrated circuit (IC) packaging and for acquisitions of equipment not otherwise available in the Brazilian domestic market.\nSMART Brazil's obligations under the BNDES 2014 Credit Agreement are also guaranteed by Ita\u00fa Bank, which guarantee is in turn secured by a guarantee from SMART Brazil and SMART do Brazil and a commitment by SMART Brazil to maintain minimum cash balances with Ita\u00fa Bank equal to 30.31% of the maximum aggregate balance of principal, interest and fees outstanding under the BNDES 2014 Credit Agreement, or approximately R$16.0 million (or $5.1 million) of required cash balances, which is shown on the Company's consolidated balance sheets as restricted cash in other noncurrent assets.\nThe available debt under the BNDES 2014 Credit Agreement accrues interest at a fixed rate of 4% per annum. The BNDES 2014 Credit Agreement is a term loan fully amortizing in 48 equal monthly installments beginning on August 15, 2016 with the final principal payment being due on July 15, 2020.\nAs of August 25, 2017 and August 26, 2016, SMART Brazil's outstanding debt under the BNDES 2014 Credit Agreement was R$39.6 million (or $12.6 million) and R$52.8 million (or $16.3 million), respectively.\nWhile the BNDES Agreements do not include any financial covenants, they contain affirmative and negative covenants customary for loans of this nature, including, among other things, an obligation to comply with all laws and regulations; a right for BNDES to terminate the loan in the event of a change of effective control; and a prohibition against the disposition or encumbrance, without BNDES consent, of intellectual property developed with the funds from the loans. The BNDES 2013 Credit Agreement includes an obligation to draw down the entire loan within specified periods of time or pay unused commitment fees of 0.1%. The BNDES 2014 Credit Agreement required a loan fee of 0.3% of the total face amount of the loan facility.\nThe future minimum principal payments under the Amended Credit Agreement and the BNDES Agreements as of August 25, 2017 are (in thousands):\nTable 187: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fiscal year ending August:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Agreement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> BNDES\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 99,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 99,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 165,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 185,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement Agreement\nUnder the Management Agreement, we record quarterly fees of $1.0 million plus out-of-pocket expenses. The Management Agreement was terminated upon the completion of our IPO on May 30, 2017. As of August 25, 2017, there are no amounts due and payable under the Management Agreement.\nTender Offer\nOn April 25, 2016, we offered the SGH Plan option holders the opportunity to exchange certain outstanding and unexercised options with exercise prices higher than $11.55 per share for new replacement options with the following terms: (a) an exercise price of $11.55 per share, (b) a lower number of shares based on pre-determined formula, (c) a vesting schedule of 2 years with 50% vesting on first anniversary and the balance vesting quarterly over the second year, and (d) a new ten-year term.\nOn May 23, 2016, the exchange, or the Tender Offer, was completed and resulted in 1,652,575 options being cancelled, in exchange for 811,277 replacement options. As a result of the Tender Offer, there was an option modification charge of $2.7 million to be expensed over the next two years, which is the vesting period of the replacement options.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of August 25, 2017 and August 26, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and they at times require the most difficult, subjective and complex estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur product revenues are predominantly derived from the sale of specialty memory solutions, including memory modules, Flash memory cards and solid state storage products, which we design and manufacture. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, product delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Product revenue typically is recognized at the time of shipment or when the customer takes title to the goods. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as sales, while costs incurred by us for shipping and handling are classified as cost of sales. Taxes, including value-added taxes, assessed by a government authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue producing transaction are excluded from revenue.\nOur service revenues are derived from procurement, logistics, inventory management, temporary warehousing, kitting and packaging services. The terms of our contracts vary, but we generally recognize service revenue upon the completion of the contracted services. Our service revenue is accounted for on an agency basis. Service revenue for these arrangements is typically based on material procurement costs plus a fee for the services provided. We determine whether to report revenue on a net or gross basis depending on a number of factors, including whether we are the primary obligor in the arrangement, have general inventory risk, have the ability to set the price, have the ability to determine who the suppliers are, can physically change the product or have credit risk. Under some service arrangements, we retain inventory risk. All inventories held under service arrangements are included in the inventories reported on the consolidated balance sheet.\nThe following is a summary of our gross billings to customers and net sales for services and products (in thousands):\nTable 188: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> August 25,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> August 26,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> August 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service revenue, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 44,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of purchased materials - service (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 864,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,390,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,503,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross billings for services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 901,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,435,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,544,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 724,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 489,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 603,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross billings to customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,625,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,925,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,147,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 724,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 489,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 603,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service revenue, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 761,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 534,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 643,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 189: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Represents cost of sales associated with service revenue reported on a net basis.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInventory Valuation\nAt each balance sheet date, we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence. This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product family. Among other factors, we consider historical demand and forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and net realizable value. We adjust the carrying values to approximate the lower of our manufacturing cost or net realizable value. Inventory cost is determined on a specific identification basis and includes material, labor and manufacturing overhead. From time to time, our customers may request that we purchase and maintain significant inventory of raw materials for specific programs. Such inventory purchases are evaluated for excess quantities and potential obsolescence and could result in a provision at the time of purchase or subsequent to purchase. Inventory levels may fluctuate based on inventory held under service arrangements. Our provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are also impacted by our arrangements with our customers and/or suppliers, including our ability or inability to re-sell such inventory to them. If actual market conditions or our customers' product demands are less favorable than those projected or if our customers or suppliers are unwilling or unable to comply with any arrangements related to their purchase or sale of inventory, additional provisions may be required and would have a negative impact on our gross margins in that period. We have had material inventory write-downs in the past for reasons such as obsolescence, excess quantities and declines in market value below our costs, and we may be required to do so from time to time in the future. Our inventory write-downs were $2.8 million, $1.8 million and $2.2 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and net operating loss and credit carryforwards. When necessary, a valuation allowance is recorded or reduced to value tax assets to amounts expected to be realized. The effect of changes in tax rates is recognized in the period in which the rate change occurs. U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes are not provided on that portion of unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are expected to be reinvested indefinitely.\nAfter excluding ordinary losses in a tax jurisdiction for which no tax benefit can be recognized, we estimate our annual effective tax rate and apply such rate to year-to-date income, adjusting for unusual or infrequent items that are treated as discrete events in the period. We also evaluate our valuation allowance to determine if a change in circumstances causes a change in judgment regarding realization of deferred tax assets in future years. If the valuation allowance is adjusted as a result of a change in judgment regarding future years, that adjustment is recorded in the period of such change affecting our tax expense in that period.\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves accounting for uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules, regulations and practices. We recognize benefits for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The\nfirst step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition of a benefit (or the absence of a liability) by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position taken will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. If it is not, in our judgment, more likely than not that the position will be sustained, then we do not recognize any benefit for the position. If it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained, a second step in the process is required to estimate how much of the benefit we will ultimately receive. This second step requires that we estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the effective tax rate, if recognized, is $1.5 million as of August 25, 2017. This evaluation is based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, new facts, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of an audit, effective settlement of audit issues and commencement of new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed\nWe review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. As of August 25, 2017, the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets was $46.0 million and $5.1 million, respectively.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe recognize compensation costs related to share-based awards granted to employees based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures. We estimate the grant date fair value, and the resulting share-based compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The grant date fair value of the share-based awards is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards.\nWe have used the Black-Scholes valuation model to assist us in determining the fair value of share-based awards. The Black-Scholes model requires the use of subjective and highly complex assumptions which determine the fair value of share-based awards. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatilities of the common stock of comparable publicly traded companies. The expected term of options granted represents the weighted average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and the historical exercise patterns. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the average U.S. Treasury yield curve at the end of the quarter in which the option was granted.\nWe used the following assumptions to value options granted under our SGH equity plan during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 190: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> August 25,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> August 26,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> August 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock options:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected term (years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45.88% - 55.75%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49.46% - 54.38%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49.51% - 53.28%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.89% - 2.03%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.36% - 1.82%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.49% - 1.72%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected dividends\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table sets forth our total share-based compensation expense during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 191: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> August 25,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> August 26,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> August 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation expense by category\n(in thousands):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFair value of ordinary shares. The fair value of the ordinary shares underlying our share options for each of our equity plans has historically been determined by our board of directors. Prior to our IPO, since there was no public market for our ordinary shares and in the absence of recent arm's length cash sales transactions of our ordinary shares with independent third parties, our board of directors has determined the fair value of our ordinary shares by considering at the time of grant a number of objective and subjective factors, including the following: the value of tangible and intangible assets of our company, the present value of anticipated future cash flows of our company, the market value of stock or equity interests in similar corporations and other entities engaged in businesses substantially similar to those engaged in by our company, our current financial condition and anticipated expenses, our need for additional capital, current and potential strategic relationships and competitive developments and periodic valuations from an independent third-party valuation firm.\nThe valuations used the income, guideline and transaction approaches based on our expected future cash flows and applied a discount for lack of marketability. The guideline approach measures value on a minority interest basis; the transaction and income approaches measure value on a controlling basis. This approach is outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held- Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation\u201d as the probability weighted expected return method. Enterprise values were calculated based on three exit scenarios, including an initial public offering, merger or acquisition, or M&A, and continuing to operate on a standalone basis. Each value was weighted equally together to arrive at an indicated enterprise value. In estimating the value of equities, management estimated a term for each of the initial public offering, M&A and continuing to operate on a stand-alone basis scenarios.\nSince our IPO, the fair value of our ordinary shares is determined by reference to the closing sales price of a share of our ordinary shares on the grant date (or if there is no closing price as of such date, the last preceding date for which a closing sales price is quoted).", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I am unable to complete your request because I am unable to identify the relevant information to complete the task.\n- I'm sorry, but I am unable to complete your request because I do not have the necessary information to do so.\n- I'm sorry, but I am unable to complete your request.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report. See also Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this report.\nWe use a 52- to 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Friday in August. Unless the context indicates otherwise, whenever we refer in this report to a particular year, with respect to ourselves, we mean the fiscal year ending in that particular calendar year. Financial information for two of our subsidiaries SMART Brazil and SMART do Brazil is included in our consolidated financial statements on a one-month lag because their fiscal years begin August 1 and end July 31.\nOverview\nWe are a global leader in specialty memory solutions, serving the electronics industry for over 25 years. As part of our global business, we have established a leading market position, as measured by market share, in Brazil as the largest in-country manufacturer of memory for desktops, notebooks and servers, as well as mobile memory for smartphones. We also have a leading market position worldwide, as measured by revenue, in specialty memory where we work closely with OEM customers to develop memory solutions, which incorporate customer-specific requirements. We believe our customers rely on us as a strategic supplier due to our customer specific designs, product quality and technical support, our global footprint and, in Brazil, our ability to provide locally manufactured memory products. We also provide customized, integrated supply chain services to certain OEM customers to assist them in the management and execution of their procurement processes.\nOur business was originally founded in 1988 as SMART Modular, which became a publicly traded company in 1995. In 1999, SMART Modular was acquired by Solectron and operated as its subsidiary. In 2002, we acquired a memory module manufacturing company in Brazil to expand our global footprint and our manufacturing capabilities. In 2004, a group of private equity investors acquired our business from Solectron, and we began to operate our business as SMART Worldwide. SMART Worldwide became a publicly traded company in 2006 and operated independently until it was acquired by investment funds affiliated with Silver Lake Partners and Silver Lake Sumeru (collectively Silver Lake\u201d) in August 2011 (the Acquisition\u201d).\nIn May 2017, we completed our IPO in which we issued and sold 6,095,000 ordinary shares, including 795,000 ordinary shares sold pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option, at a price of $11.00 per share. We received aggregate proceeds of $63.5 million from the sale of ordinary shares, net of underwriters' discounts and commissions, but before deducting offering expenses of approximately $2.7 million. In June 2017, we used the net proceeds to make a mandatory prepayment of $61.1 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding term loans under the Amended Credit Agreement.\nSince 2002, when we commenced our operations in Brazil, we have invested over $170 million to build and improve our advanced manufacturing facilities and have assembled and trained a staff of over 480 employees, who comprise many of the leading semiconductor technology professionals in the country. In Brazil, we process imported wafers and cut, package and test them to create memory components used to manufacture modules and other memory and Flash-based products. We are the only company engaged in packaging and test for mobile memory for smartphones in Brazil. We have a strategic, long-term relationship with a global memory wafer supplier that has provided us with a stable source of competitively priced wafers for the Brazilian market and provides our supplier with access to that market through our in-country infrastructure and capabilities.\nOur business in Brazil has historically focused on DRAM components and modules for desktops, notebooks and servers, where local content and tax regulations provide substantial financial incentives to our customers to procure locally manufactured memory products, particularly when they are made with locally processed components. We have leveraged our experience and success in these markets to expand into mobile memory, primarily for smartphones, which include eMMC and eMCP, where additional local content requirements and tax\nincentives have been introduced. In fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, these mobile memory products accounted for 67%, 65% and 29%, respectively, of our net sales in Brazil. Based on industry data of expected unit sales for mobile phones in Brazil and taking into account our average selling price of approximately $19.80 per eMCP for mobile memory during the full fiscal year 2017, we believe that the total addressable market for locally produced mobile memory for mobile phones in Brazil will reach approximately $580 million by 2019. We have demonstrated our ability to service the smartphone market in Brazil as we are now qualified at seven of the top ten mobile vendors in Brazil representing, according to industry data, over 85% of the mobile phones sold in Brazil in calendar 2016. With local content requirements for various IT products increasing, we believe that our local manufacturing capabilities provide a valuable and differentiated offering to our OEM customers in Brazil. We also believe that our long-term relationships with many of these customers as the largest supplier of locally manufactured memory products provides us with visibility for our Brazilian business.\nWe began participating in Brazil's PPB/IT Program in February 2011. The PPB/IT Program is intended to promote local content by allowing qualified PPB/IT Program companies to sell certain IT products with a reduced rate of IPI as compared to the rate that is required to be collected by non-qualified suppliers. The PPB/IT Program provides an incentive for certain customers to purchase from us because our sales will not be subject to the regular level of IPI. In order to receive the intended treatment as a PPB/IT Program supplier, our subsidiary SMART do Brazil is required to invest in research and development activities conducted in Brazil in an amount equal to 3% of its gross annual sales revenues reduced by the following: the cost of raw materials qualified as products eligible for the PPB/IT Program, including the ICs that are purchased from our other Brazilian subsidiary, SMART Brazil, and that are used to make memory modules; applicable sales taxes; the value of products exported out of Brazil; and the value of products shipped to the Manaus Free Trade Zone. In August 2014, the government of Brazil enacted legislation extending the PPB/IT Program until 2029 and maintaining the required research and development investment with respect to DRAM modules at 3.00% of adjusted sales through 2029, repealing the previously approved increases to 3.75% in 2015 and 3.50% in 2016 through 2019.\nIn 2013, the EU, later joined by Japan, requested the establishment of a panel within the WTO to determine whether certain measures enacted by the Brazilian government concerning tax incentives and local content requirements for the automotive and several other industries including the IT industry and including PADIS, the PPB/IT Program and Lei do Bem, are inconsistent with WTO rules. In December 2016, the WTO circulated its report to the parties. This report was released to the public on August 30, 2017. In its report, the panel concluded, among other things, that the tax exemptions, reductions and suspensions granted for the automotive, IT and other industries amount to subsidies that are inconsistent with the principles of the various WTO agreements, and the panel recommended that Brazil withdraw these subsidies. Government officials in Brazil have expressed their intent, if necessary, to restructure the incentives to be consistent with the WTO principles and to continue to support local industry, however, there can be no assurance that the programs will ultimately be restructured and implemented or, if implemented, whether the restructured programs will provide the same level of support as is currently in place. Brazil has notified the WTO of its decision to appeal the panel's findings. While we cannot predict the impact of the WTO's report, this recommendation could result in significant adverse changes to the local content rules and incentives available to us and our customers in Brazil. Any suspension, early termination or other adverse change in the local content requirements could significantly reduce the demand for, and the profit margins on, our products in Brazil, and would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA major corruption scandal involving Brazil's largest energy company, Petrobras, began to unfold in 2014, and by 2015 contributed to a significant decrease in the value of the Brazilian real, which in turn led to a substantial downturn in the Brazilian economy and a substantial rise in unemployment. Our net sales in Brazil decreased from $407.4 million in fiscal 2014 to $245.5 million in fiscal 2016. While economic conditions in Brazil remain challenging, the value of the Brazilian real has strengthened in recent periods, and our net sales in Brazil increased to $398.4 million in fiscal 2017.\nIn our specialty memory solutions business, we offer an extensive portfolio of over 2,000 products, which includes all generations of DRAM, as well as embedded and removable Flash, enterprise memory and hybrid volatile and non-volatile memory solutions. We also offer customized, integrated supply chain services to enable our customers to manage supply chain planning and execution, which reduces costs and increases productivity. Our supply chain services are based on our proprietary software platform that we develop and are integrated with our customers' respective procurement management systems as well as our suppliers' distribution management systems.\nWe generated net sales of $761.3 million, $534.4 million and $643.5 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our net sales grew 42% in fiscal 2017 over fiscal 2016 and decreased 17% in fiscal 2016 over fiscal 2015. Our net loss was $7.8 million, $20.0 million and $46.5 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our income (loss) from operations was $53.9 million in fiscal 2017, $6.2 million in fiscal 2016 and ($6.7) million in fiscal 2015.\nOur global, diversified customer base includes over 250 end customers, such as Cisco, Samsung, HPE, Dell and LG. Our top ten end customers, five of which have been our end customers for over a decade, accounted for 84% of our net sales, including sales to contract manufacturers or ODMs at the direction of such end customers, in fiscal 2017. Of our end customers, Samsung accounted for 19%, 13% and 11% of net sales in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively; Cisco accounted for 15%, 19% and 16% of net sales in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively; Lenovo accounted for 11% and 13% of net sales in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively; Dell accounted for 15% of net sales in fiscal 2015; and HP accounted for 14% of net sales in fiscal 2015 (in fiscal 2016, HP undertook a spin-off and divided into two distinct companies, following which neither company accounted for 10% or more of our net sales). Direct sales to Samsung accounted for 19%, 13% and 11% of net sales in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively; direct sales to Flex accounted for 14% and 17% of net sales in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively; direct sales to Hon Hai accounted for 13%, 11% and 11% of net sales in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively; and direct sales to Dell accounted for 15% of net sales in fiscal 2015. During these periods, no other customers accounted for more than 10% of our net sales. Of the $761.3 million of net sales in fiscal 2017, 52% were generated in Brazil, 23% were generated in Asia, 21% were generated in North America and 4% were generated in Europe. Of the $534.4 million of net sales in fiscal 2016, 46% were generated in Brazil, 26% were generated in Asia, 23% were generated in North America and 5% were generated in Europe. For further geographic information regarding our net sales and property and equipment, net, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.\nComponents of Operating Results\nNet Sales\nWe generate product revenues predominantly from sales of our memory solutions, including memory modules, Flash memory cards and other solid state storage products, principally to OEMs that compete in the computing, networking, communications, storage, aerospace, defense, mobile and industrial markets. Sales of our products are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders and are not based on long-term supply agreements. We generate service revenue by providing procurement, logistics, inventory management, temporary warehousing, kitting and packaging services. Our net sales are dependent upon demand in the end markets for our customers' products and fluctuations in end-user demand can have a rapid and material effect on our net sales. Furthermore, sales to relatively few customers have accounted for, and we expect for the foreseeable future will continue to account for, a significant percentage of our net sales.\nCost of Sales\nThe most significant components of cost of sales are materials, fixed manufacturing costs, labor, depreciation, freight and customs charges. Increases in capital expenditures may increase our future cost of sales due to higher levels of depreciation expense. Cost of sales also includes any inventory write-downs. We have in the past, and may in the future, write down inventory for a variety of reasons, including obsolescence, excess quantities and declines in market value below our cost. A significant percentage of our cost of sales consists of the cost of DRAM and Flash components and wafers. While we have historically received competitive pricing and have had consistent sources of supply for these supplies, we do not have agreements that provide us with fixed pricing or guarantees of supply. Increases in DRAM pricing typically improve our margins, at least in the short term and particularly in our operations in Brazil, as we consume previously purchased inventory. However, declines in DRAM pricing often require us to reduce our prices even as we consume higher priced DRAM inventory, thereby reducing our margins.\nGross Profit\nGross profit and gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the average sales prices of our products, manufacturing and overhead costs, the mix of products sold and our ability to leverage our existing infrastructure as we continue to grow. We expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time depending on the factors described above.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of research and development expense, selling, general and administrative expense and management advisory fees. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses.\nResearch and development expense. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs, consulting costs, allocated overhead and other costs to support our development activities. To date, we have expensed all research and development costs as incurred. We expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our research and product development efforts to enhance our product capabilities and access new customer markets, although such expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total net sales. In order to qualify for certain tax incentives under PADIS and PPB/IT Program in Brazil, we are required to expend a minimum amount on research and development in Brazil.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs, sales commission costs and allocated overhead. We expense sales commission costs as incurred. Sales and marketing expense also includes costs for recruiting and training channel partners, market development programs, promotional and other marketing activities, travel, office equipment and outside consulting costs. We expect sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our sales and marketing headcount in all markets and expand our international operations, although such expense may fluctuate as a percentage of net sales.\nGeneral and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs, facilities and non-manufacturing equipment costs, allowances for bad debt and other support costs, including utilities, insurance and professional fees. We expect that we will incur increased general and administrative expenses as a result of being a publicly-traded company, including significant increased legal and accounting costs related to compliance with rules and regulations implemented by the SEC and NASDAQ, as well as additional insurance, investor relations and other costs associated with being a public company.\nManagement advisory fees. Management advisory fees consist of quarterly fees plus out-of-pocket expenses, which are payable by us to Silver Lake Management Company III, L.L.C. and Silver Lake Management Company Sumeru, L.L.C., affiliates of Silver Lake, or the Managers, under the Amended and Restated Transaction and Management Fee Agreement, or the Management Agreement. We terminated the Management Agreement upon the completion of our initial public offering.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net consists primarily of interest expense on our debt obligations.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net includes gains and losses from foreign currency transactions and other non-operating items.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nWe record income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, we generally consider all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates. We provide valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nWe recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. We then measure the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. In the event that we recognize any unrecognized tax benefits, the effective tax rate will be affected. If recognized, approximately $1.5 million of unrecognized tax benefit would impact the effective tax rate at August 25, 2017. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, we cannot assure that the final tax outcome of these matters will be the same as these estimates. We update these estimates quarterly based on factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, new audit activity and effectively settled issues.\nWe follow specific and detailed guidelines in each tax jurisdiction regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide necessary valuation allowances as required. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the tax law. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and our ability to successfully execute our business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.\nResults of Operations\nThe following is a summary of our results of operations for the periods presented. The period-to-period comparison of results is not necessarily indicative of results for future periods.\n\nComparison of the Years Ended August 25, 2017 and August 26, 2016\n\n (1) Includes share-based compensation expense of $0.6 million and $0.5 million in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. \nNet Sales, Cost of Sales and Gross Margin\nNet sales increased by $226.9 million, or 42.5%, during fiscal 2017 compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to a 67% higher sales volume of mobile memory products in Brazil in fiscal 2017, which was driven in part by new product introductions of higher density eMCP products and the increase in local content requirements to 50% for mobile memory products for smartphones effective January 1, 2017, as well as a 36% increase in the average selling prices of mobile memory products in Brazil during fiscal 2017 due to density changes. Strategic investments to increase production capacity in prior periods helped enable us to meet the increased demand in the Brazil mobile memory market. Our Brazil PC DRAM and our specialty DRAM sales also increased and were positively impacted by overall strength in the worldwide DRAM market, leading to 53% and 44% higher volumes and 6% and 24% increases in the average selling prices during fiscal 2017, respectively, compared to the prior fiscal year, as well as strength in the server, networking, communications and storage markets.\nCost of sales increased by $171.6 million, or 40.1%, during fiscal 2017 compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase of 43% in the cost of materials for the higher level of sales, as well as higher depreciation in Brazil due to the technology transition from third generation double-data-rate ( DDR3\u201d) Fine-pitch Ball Grid Array ( FBGA\u201d) packaging to fourth generation double-data-rate ( DDR4\u201d) flip chip and higher production costs related to the increased revenue. Included in the cost of sales increase was an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $5.4 million due to locally sourced cost of sales in Brazil.\nGross margin increased to 21.3% during fiscal 2017, compared to 20.0% for fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher Brazil mobile memory and specialty DRAM revenue while cost of sales associated with higher density memory modules increased at a lower rate.\nOperating Expenses\n\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development, or R&D, expense was essentially flat in fiscal 2017 compared to the prior year as higher personnel-related expenses were offset by lower outside services. Included in the R&D expense increase was an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $1.5 million\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expense increased by $9.3 million, or 16.1%, during fiscal 2017 compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to personnel-related, facilities, professional and shareholder services expenses, aggregating $9.0 million, as well as $1.7 million debt extension costs, partially offset by a $1.4 million decrease in intangible amortization expense as some intangible assets became fully amortized. Included in the SG&A expense increase was an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $1.6 million.\nOther Income (Expense)\n\nInterest expense, net increased $3.6 million, or 14.2%, during fiscal 2017 compared to the prior year primarily due to additional debt discount amortization and interest expense related to our debt extension. Other income (expense), net decreased by $24.4 million primarily due to a $15.2 million loss on extinguishment of our long-term debt, a $6.7 million loss on early debt repayment, a $1.4 million loss on a February 2017 debt extinguishment, and an $0.8 million currency loss (mainly in Brazil).\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\nProvision for income taxes increased by $7.5 million, or 305.6% during fiscal 2017 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to higher income in non-U.S. jurisdictions subject to tax.\nComparison of the Years Ended August 26, 2016 and August 28, 2015\n\n (1) Includes share-based compensation expense of $0.5 million and $0.8 million in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. \nNet Sales, Cost of Sales and Gross Margin\nNet sales decreased by $109.0 million, or 16.9%, during fiscal 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to 47% lower volume and 32% lower average selling prices of our DRAM products in Brazil due in large part to a major corruption scandal involving Brazil's largest energy company, Petrobras, which began to unfold in calendar 2014, and by calendar 2015 contributed to a significant decrease in the value of the Brazilian real. This led to a substantial downturn in the Brazilian economy toward the end of fiscal 2015, which continued into fiscal 2016. The decrease in net sales was offset in part by a 79% increase in average selling prices and a 15% increase in volume for our mobile memory products in Brazil, as local content requirements for mobile memory products for smartphones increased from 25% to 40% effective January 1, 2016. In addition, our net sales were also negatively impacted by lower worldwide DRAM prices, leading to a 23% decrease in our average selling prices of our specialty DRAM products in fiscal 2016, partially offset by 10% higher volume.\nCost of sales decreased by $84.5 million, or 16.5%, during fiscal 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease in cost of sales was driven primarily by a $73.4 million decrease in the cost of materials due to lower sales. In addition, our factory overhead and other components of cost of sales decreased by $11.1 million, primarily due to lower production costs, personnel-related expenses and depreciation as well as charges for inventory reserves. The cost of sales decrease is net of an offsetting favorable foreign exchange impact of $10.7 million due to locally sourced cost of sales in Brazil. Gross margin remained relatively flat for both periods.\nOperating Expenses\n\nResearch and Development Expenses\nR&D expense decreased by $5.6 million, or 12.9%, during fiscal 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to decreased spending as a result of the deteriorating economic conditions in Brazil, lower intangible amortization expense as certain intangible assets were fully amortized in fiscal 2015, as well as an in-process research and development charge of $1.6 million in fiscal 2015, which did not recur in fiscal 2016. Included in the R&D expense decrease was a favorable foreign exchange impact of $3.4 million.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expense decreased by $31.7 million, or 35.6%, during fiscal 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $16.2 million in intangible amortization expense related to assets that were fully amortized in fiscal 2015, lower professional services and personnel-related costs, aggregating $8.9 million, as well as a non-recurring write-off of $4.0 million of deferred public offering costs in fiscal 2015. Included in the SG&A expense decrease was a favorable foreign exchange impact of $3.7 million\nOther Income (Expense)\n\nInterest expense, net, decreased by $2.0 million, or 7.2%, during fiscal 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to $0.5 million higher interest income and $1.4 million lower interest expense, due mainly to lower balances on our revolver and term loan. Other income (expense), net increased by $7.4 million during fiscal 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily due to an $11.8 million currency gain (mainly in Brazil) arising from transactions not denominated in the functional currency, partially offset by a $4.3 million decrease in fees received in fiscal 2015 under a transition services agreement that we entered into with SanDisk in connection with the sale of the Storage Business as this agreement terminated in fiscal 2015.\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\nProvision for income taxes decreased by $4.2 million, or 63.2%, during fiscal 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to lower foreign income in certain taxable jurisdictions.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nAt August 25, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $22.4 million, of which approximately $14.8 million was held outside of the United States.\nOn May 30, 2017, we completed our IPO and raised proceeds, net of underwriting commissions and discounts and other offering costs, of approximately $60.8 million. On June 2, 2017, we used the net proceeds to make a mandatory prepayment of $61.1 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding term loans under the Amended Credit Agreement.\nWe expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents, line of credit and cash generated by operating activities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. Our principal uses of cash and capital resources are debt service requirements as described below, capital expenditures, R&D expenditures and working capital requirements. We expect that future capital expenditures will focus on expanding capacity of our Brazilian operations, expanding our R&D activities, manufacturing equipment upgrades and/or acquisitions and IT infrastructure and software upgrades. Cash and cash equivalents consist of funds held in demand deposit accounts and money market funds. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.\nOperating Activities\nDuring the fiscal 2017, cash used in operating activities was $0.9 million. The primary factors affecting our cash flows during this period were a $61.2 million change in our net operating assets and liabilities and $7.8 million net loss, partially offset by $68.1 million of non-cash related expenses. The $61.2 million change in net operating assets and liabilities consisted of increases of $40.4 million in accounts receivable and $21.9 million in inventory, and decrease of $10.6 million in accounts payable, offset by an increase of $11.7 million in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The increase in accounts receivable was due to lower purchases under our Receivables Purchasing Agreement, while the increase in inventory was due to both higher sales forecast and higher cost of materials resulting from increased DRAM prices.\nDuring fiscal 2016, cash provided by operating activities was $15.1 million. The primary factors affecting our cash flows during this period were $38.6 million of non-cash related expenses, offset by a $20.0 million net loss and a $3.5 million change in our net operating assets and liabilities. The $3.5 million change in operating assets and liabilities consisted of decreases of $44.9 million in accounts receivable, $31.3 million in inventory and $11.0 million in prepaid expenses and other assets, offset by decreases of $86.5 million in accounts payable and $4.2 million in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The decreases in accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable were primarily due to lower gross sales.\nDuring fiscal 2015, cash provided by operating activities was $40.8 million. The primary factors affecting our cash flows during this period were $64.2 million of non-cash related expenses and a $23.1 million change in our net operating assets and liabilities, offset by a $46.5 million net loss. The $23.1 million change in operating assets and liabilities consisted of a decrease of $8.6 million in accounts receivable and an increase of $53.2 million in accounts payable, offset by increases of $20.0 million in inventory and $0.4 million in prepaid expenses and other assets, and a decrease of $18.3 million in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The increases in inventory and accounts payable were primarily due to higher gross sales.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2017 was $18.0 million consisting primarily of $18.7 million used for purchases of property and equipment, offset by $0.7 million proceeds from sale of property and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2016 was $13.4 million consisting primarily of $13.8 million used for purchases of property and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2015 was $8.7 million, primarily resulting from $31.7 million used for purchases of property and equipment, $6.1 million of restricted cash related to our BNDES Credit Agreements in Brazil and $1.6 million used to purchase other assets, offset by $30.5 million of proceeds from the Escrow Release related to the sale of our Storage Business.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2017 was $17.0 million, consisting of $151.9 million payment for extinguishment of long-term debt and debt extension, $61.1 million early payment on term loan, $19.7 million long-term debt payments for both the Amended Credit Agreement and the BNDES Credit Agreements, as well as $3.2 million fees paid for revolver, offset by $157.0 million proceeds from issuance of long-term debt and $62.4 million proceeds from IPO. Net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2016 was $10.9 million, consisting primarily of $16.7 million of long-term debt payments, offset by $5.8 million received under our BNDES Credit Agreements in Brazil. Net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2015 was $32.6 million, consisting primarily of $28.3 million for distribution of share premium to our shareholders in connection with the Escrow Release, $13.3 million of long-term debt payments, $3.1 million for payment of costs related to our IPO, $1.1 million of payments for the cancellation of options related to the Escrow Release and $0.9 million for strike price floor payments to optionholders as equitable adjustments required under the SGH Plan in connection with the Escrow Release, offset by $14.1 million received under our BNDES Credit Agreements in Brazil.\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations as of August 25, 2017 are set forth below:\n\nSenior Secured Credit Agreement\nOn August 9, 2017, SMART Worldwide, SMART Modular Technologies (Global), Inc. (Global) and SMART Modular entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (together with all related documents, as amended from time to time, the Amended Credit Agreement) with certain lenders which amended and restated that certain Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as November 5, 2016 (the ARCA), which had amended and restated that certain Credit Agreement dated as of August 26, 2011 (the Original Credit Agreement). The Company's subsidiaries named as borrowers in the Amended Credit Agreement and certain other subsidiaries that entered into a guarantee with respect to the Amended Credit Agreement, are collectively referred to as the Loan Parties and together with SMART Malaysia, the Credit Group. The Amended Credit Agreement provides for $165 million of term loans with a maturity date of August 9, 2022 and $50 million of revolving loans with a maturity date of February 9, 2021 (the Initial Revolver Maturity Date) which revolving loan maturity date automatically extends to February 9, 2022 if the total leverage ratio of the Credit Group is less than 3.0:1.0 on the Initial Revolver Maturity Date. SMART Global Holding is not a party to the Amended Credit Agreement.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement is jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior basis by certain subsidiaries of Global (excluding, among other subsidiaries, SMART Malaysia). In addition, the Amended Credit Agreement is secured by a pledge of the capital stock of, or equity interests in, most of the subsidiaries of SMART Worldwide (including, without limitation, SMART Malaysia) and by substantially all of the assets of the subsidiaries of SMART Worldwide, excluding the assets of SMART Malaysia and certain other subsidiaries.\nCovenants. The Amended Credit Agreement contains various representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants that are usual and customary for loans of this nature including, among other things, limitations on the Credit Group's ability to engage in certain transactions, incur debt, pay dividends, and make investments. The Amended Credit Agreement also requires that the Credit Group maintain a Secured Leverage Ratio not in excess of 3.5:1.0 as of the end of each fiscal quarter (commencing with the fiscal quarter ending November 24, 2017) and puts restrictions on the Credit Group's ability to retain cash proceeds from the sale of certain assets with net proceeds in excess of $2 million, subject to customary six-month reinvestment rights.\nInterest and Interest Rates. Loans under the Amended Credit Agreement accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin plus, at the borrowers' option, either a LIBOR rate, or a base rate. The applicable margin for term loans with respect to LIBOR borrowings is 6.25% and with respect to base rate borrowings is 5.25%. The interest rate on the term loans was 7.57%, 8.25% and 8.25% as of August 25, 2017, August 26, 2016, and August 28, 2015 respectively.\nThe applicable margin for revolving loans adjusts every quarter based on the Secured Leverage Ratio for the most recent fiscal quarter with the applicable margin for revolving loans with respect to LIBOR borrowings ranging from 3.75% to 4.00% and the applicable margin for revolving loans with respect to base rate borrowings ranging from 2.75% to 3.00%. Prior to November 5, 2016, the effective date of the ARCA, the applicable margin was pegged to the Secured Net Leverage Ratio.\nInterest on base rate loans is payable on the last day of each calendar quarter. Interest on LIBOR-based loans is payable every one, two, three, six, nine or twelve months after the date of each borrowing, dependent on the particular interest rate period selected with respect to such borrowing.\nPrincipal Payments. The Amended Credit Agreement requires quarterly repayments of principal under the term loans equal to 2.5% of $165 million, or $4.1 million per fiscal quarter. During fiscal 2017 and 2016, the borrowers made scheduled principal payments of $11.6 million and $13.3 million, respectively.\nPrepayments. The borrowers have the right at any time to make optional prepayments of the principal amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement, provided that prepayments of principal which are voluntary or are made in connection with certain transactions will be subject to prepayment premiums of 3%, 2% and 1% during the first, second and third years, respectively, after the effective date of the Amended Credit Agreement.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement also requires certain mandatory prepayments of principal whereby the borrowers must prepay outstanding loans, subject to certain exceptions, which include, among other things:\n \u2022 75% of excess cash flow on a semi-annual basis if the total leverage ratio is greater than 1.5:1.0, (ii) 50% of excess cash flow on a semi-annual basis if the total leverage ratio is greater than 1.0:1.0 but less than or equal to 1.5:1.0 and (iii) 25% of excess cash flow on an annual basis if the secured leverage ratio is less than or equal to 1.0:1.0., which amounts will be reduced by any permitted voluntary prepayments of principal made in the applicable fiscal year; \n \u2022 100% of the net proceeds of certain asset sales or other dispositions of property of Global or any of its restricted subsidiaries, subject to limited rights to reinvest the proceeds within six months; and \n \u2022 100% of the net cash proceeds of incurrence of certain debt by Global or any of its restricted subsidiaries, other than proceeds from certain debt to be incurred under the Amended Credit Agreement. \nNo mandatory prepayments were required for fiscal 2017.\nOn November 29, 2016, the Credit Group received all required approvals from the lenders and entered into Amendment No. 4 to the Credit Agreement (Amendment 4) dated as of November 5, 2016 (the Amendment 4 Effective Date) which, among other things, adopted the ARCA. Pursuant to Amendment 4, the borrowers agreed to pay the Administrative Agent a fee in the amount of $1 million pursuant to a separate agreement and to pay a fee in the form of an additional term loan, in the amount of $5 million for the ratable account of the term lenders party to Amendment 4. Additionally, SMART Global Holdings was obligated to make an aggregate equity investment of at least $9.9 million in cash in Global, and SMART Global Holdings was obligated to issue 3,467,571 warrants (the\nLender Warrants) to purchase 20% on a pro forma basis, of the then outstanding ordinary shares of SMART Global Holdings, to the term lenders party to Amendment 4, which Lender Warrants were exercisable at $0.03 per share, with 1,541,143 warrants totaling 10% of SMART Global Holdings' then outstanding shares (the First Tranche Warrants) exercisable immediately and 1,926,428 warrants to purchase an additional 10% of SMART Global Holdings' then outstanding shares (the Second Tranche Warrants), exercisable only if there were balances outstanding under the original term loans at the one year anniversary of the Amendment 4 Effective Date. The relative fair value of the Lender Warrants and the fees payable to the lenders in connection with the ARCA were recorded as debt discount and resulted in additional interest expense over the then amended term of the loan using the effective interest method following debt modification accounting.\nUnder the terms of the ARCA, the maturity date of the term loans and the revolving loans was extended from August 26, 2017, to August 26, 2019. If there were balances still outstanding on the original term loans at the one year anniversary of the Amendment 4 Effective Date, the borrowers would have been obligated to pay an additional fee to the term lenders of $5 million in cash. In addition, the ARCA increased the quarterly scheduled principal payments of term loans to $3.9 million per quarter to be paid on the last day of each fiscal quarter starting November 25, 2016. Under the ARCA, early mandatory repayments of principle were applied in the reverse order of maturity.\nOn June 2, 2017, SMART Global Holdings contributed $61.0 million from the proceeds of the IPO, to Global which proceeds Global in turn used to pay down the original term loans as required under the ARCA, resulted in a $6.7 million loss on early repayment", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report. See also Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this report.\nWe use a 52- to 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Friday in August. Unless the context indicates otherwise, whenever we refer in this report to a particular year, with respect to ourselves, we mean the fiscal year ending in that particular calendar year. Financial information for two of our subsidiaries SMART Brazil and SMART do Brazil is included in our consolidated financial statements on a one-month lag because their fiscal years begin August 1 and end July 31.\nOverview\nWe are a global leader in specialty memory solutions, serving the electronics industry for over 25 years. As part of our global business, we have established a leading market position, as measured by market share, in Brazil as the largest in-country manufacturer of memory for desktops, notebooks and servers, as well as mobile memory for smartphones. We also have a leading market position worldwide, as measured by revenue, in specialty memory where we work closely with OEM customers to develop memory solutions, which incorporate customer-specific requirements. We believe our customers rely on us as a strategic supplier due to our customer specific designs, product quality and technical support, our global footprint and, in Brazil, our ability to provide locally manufactured memory products. We also provide customized, integrated supply chain services to certain OEM customers to assist them in the management and execution of their procurement processes.\nOur business was originally founded in 1988 as SMART Modular, which became a publicly traded company in 1995. In 1999, SMART Modular was acquired by Solectron and operated as its subsidiary. In 2002, we acquired a memory module manufacturing company in Brazil to expand our global footprint and our manufacturing capabilities. In 2004, a group of private equity investors acquired our business from Solectron, and we began to operate our business as SMART Worldwide. SMART Worldwide became a publicly traded company in 2006 and operated independently until it was acquired by investment funds affiliated with Silver Lake Partners and Silver Lake Sumeru (collectively Silver Lake\u201d) in August 2011 (the Acquisition\u201d).\nIn May 2017, we completed our IPO in which we issued and sold 6,095,000 ordinary shares, including 795,000 ordinary shares sold pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option, at a price of $11.00 per share. We received aggregate proceeds of $63.5 million from the sale of ordinary shares, net of underwriters' discounts and commissions, but before deducting offering expenses of approximately $2.7 million. In June 2017, we used the net proceeds to make a mandatory prepayment of $61.1 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding term loans under the Amended Credit Agreement.\nSince 2002, when we commenced our operations in Brazil, we have invested over $170 million to build and improve our advanced manufacturing facilities and have assembled and trained a staff of over 480 employees, who comprise many of the leading semiconductor technology professionals in the country. In Brazil, we process imported wafers and cut, package and test them to create memory components used to manufacture modules and other memory and Flash-based products. We are the only company engaged in packaging and test for mobile memory for smartphones in Brazil. We have a strategic, long-term relationship with a global memory wafer supplier that has provided us with a stable source of competitively priced wafers for the Brazilian market and provides our supplier with access to that market through our in-country infrastructure and capabilities.\nOur business in Brazil has historically focused on DRAM components and modules for desktops, notebooks and servers, where local content and tax regulations provide substantial financial incentives to our customers to procure locally manufactured memory products, particularly when they are made with locally processed components. We have leveraged our experience and success in these markets to expand into mobile memory, primarily for smartphones, which include eMMC and eMCP, where additional local content requirements and tax\nincentives have been introduced. In fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, these mobile memory products accounted for 67%, 65% and 29%, respectively, of our net sales in Brazil. Based on industry data of expected unit sales for mobile phones in Brazil and taking into account our average selling price of approximately $19.80 per eMCP for mobile memory during the full fiscal year 2017, we believe that the total addressable market for locally produced mobile memory for mobile phones in Brazil will reach approximately $580 million by 2019. We have demonstrated our ability to service the smartphone market in Brazil as we are now qualified at seven of the top ten mobile vendors in Brazil representing, according to industry data, over 85% of the mobile phones sold in Brazil in calendar 2016. With local content requirements for various IT products increasing, we believe that our local manufacturing capabilities provide a valuable and differentiated offering to our OEM customers in Brazil. We also believe that our long-term relationships with many of these customers as the largest supplier of locally manufactured memory products provides us with visibility for our Brazilian business.\nWe began participating in Brazil's PPB/IT Program in February 2011. The PPB/IT Program is intended to promote local content by allowing qualified PPB/IT Program companies to sell certain IT products with a reduced rate of IPI as compared to the rate that is required to be collected by non-qualified suppliers. The PPB/IT Program provides an incentive for certain customers to purchase from us because our sales will not be subject to the regular level of IPI. In order to receive the intended treatment as a PPB/IT Program supplier, our subsidiary SMART do Brazil is required to invest in research and development activities conducted in Brazil in an amount equal to 3% of its gross annual sales revenues reduced by the following: the cost of raw materials qualified as products eligible for the PPB/IT Program, including the ICs that are purchased from our other Brazilian subsidiary, SMART Brazil, and that are used to make memory modules; applicable sales taxes; the value of products exported out of Brazil; and the value of products shipped to the Manaus Free Trade Zone. In August 2014, the government of Brazil enacted legislation extending the PPB/IT Program until 2029 and maintaining the required research and development investment with respect to DRAM modules at 3.00% of adjusted sales through 2029, repealing the previously approved increases to 3.75% in 2015 and 3.50% in 2016 through 2019.\nIn 2013, the EU, later joined by Japan, requested the establishment of a panel within the WTO to determine whether certain measures enacted by the Brazilian government concerning tax incentives and local content requirements for the automotive and several other industries including the IT industry and including PADIS, the PPB/IT Program and Lei do Bem, are inconsistent with WTO rules. In December 2016, the WTO circulated its report to the parties. This report was released to the public on August 30, 2017. In its report, the panel concluded, among other things, that the tax exemptions, reductions and suspensions granted for the automotive, IT and other industries amount to subsidies that are inconsistent with the principles of the various WTO agreements, and the panel recommended that Brazil withdraw these subsidies. Government officials in Brazil have expressed their intent, if necessary, to restructure the incentives to be consistent with the WTO principles and to continue to support local industry, however, there can be no assurance that the programs will ultimately be restructured and implemented or, if implemented, whether the restructured programs will provide the same level of support as is currently in place. Brazil has notified the WTO of its decision to appeal the panel's findings. While we cannot predict the impact of the WTO's report, this recommendation could result in significant adverse changes to the local content rules and incentives available to us and our customers in Brazil. Any suspension, early termination or other adverse change in the local content requirements could significantly reduce the demand for, and the profit margins on, our products in Brazil, and would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA major corruption scandal involving Brazil's largest energy company, Petrobras, began to unfold in 2014, and by 2015 contributed to a significant decrease in the value of the Brazilian real, which in turn led to a substantial downturn in the Brazilian economy and a substantial rise in unemployment. Our net sales in Brazil decreased from $407.4 million in fiscal 2014 to $245.5 million in fiscal 2016. While economic conditions in Brazil remain challenging, the value of the Brazilian real has strengthened in recent periods, and our net sales in Brazil increased to $398.4 million in fiscal 2017.\nIn our specialty memory solutions business, we offer an extensive portfolio of over 2,000 products, which includes all generations of DRAM, as well as embedded and removable Flash, enterprise memory and hybrid volatile and non-volatile memory solutions. We also offer customized, integrated supply chain services to enable our customers to manage supply chain planning and execution, which reduces costs and increases productivity. Our supply chain services are based on our proprietary software platform that we develop and are integrated with our customers' respective procurement management systems as well as our suppliers' distribution management systems.\nWe generated net sales of $761.3 million, $534.4 million and $643.5 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our net sales grew 42% in fiscal 2017 over fiscal 2016 and decreased 17% in fiscal 2016 over fiscal 2015. Our net loss was $7.8 million, $20.0 million and $46.5 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our income (loss) from operations was $53.9 million in fiscal 2017, $6.2 million in fiscal 2016 and ($6.7) million in fiscal 2015.\nOur global, diversified customer base includes over 250 end customers, such as Cisco, Samsung, HPE, Dell and LG. Our top ten end customers, five of which have been our end customers for over a decade, accounted for 84% of our net sales, including sales to contract manufacturers or ODMs at the direction of such end customers, in fiscal 2017. Of our end customers, Samsung accounted for 19%, 13% and 11% of net sales in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively; Cisco accounted for 15%, 19% and 16% of net sales in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively; Lenovo accounted for 11% and 13% of net sales in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively; Dell accounted for 15% of net sales in fiscal 2015; and HP accounted for 14% of net sales in fiscal 2015 (in fiscal 2016, HP undertook a spin-off and divided into two distinct companies, following which neither company accounted for 10% or more of our net sales). Direct sales to Samsung accounted for 19%, 13% and 11% of net sales in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively; direct sales to Flex accounted for 14% and 17% of net sales in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively; direct sales to Hon Hai accounted for 13%, 11% and 11% of net sales in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively; and direct sales to Dell accounted for 15% of net sales in fiscal 2015. During these periods, no other customers accounted for more than 10% of our net sales. Of the $761.3 million of net sales in fiscal 2017, 52% were generated in Brazil, 23% were generated in Asia, 21% were generated in North America and 4% were generated in Europe. Of the $534.4 million of net sales in fiscal 2016, 46% were generated in Brazil, 26% were generated in Asia, 23% were generated in North America and 5% were generated in Europe. For further geographic information regarding our net sales and property and equipment, net, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.\nComponents of Operating Results\nNet Sales\nWe generate product revenues predominantly from sales of our memory solutions, including memory modules, Flash memory cards and other solid state storage products, principally to OEMs that compete in the computing, networking, communications, storage, aerospace, defense, mobile and industrial markets. Sales of our products are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders and are not based on long-term supply agreements. We generate service revenue by providing procurement, logistics, inventory management, temporary warehousing, kitting and packaging services. Our net sales are dependent upon demand in the end markets for our customers' products and fluctuations in end-user demand can have a rapid and material effect on our net sales. Furthermore, sales to relatively few customers have accounted for, and we expect for the foreseeable future will continue to account for, a significant percentage of our net sales.\nCost of Sales\nThe most significant components of cost of sales are materials, fixed manufacturing costs, labor, depreciation, freight and customs charges. Increases in capital expenditures may increase our future cost of sales due to higher levels of depreciation expense. Cost of sales also includes any inventory write-downs. We have in the past, and may in the future, write down inventory for a variety of reasons, including obsolescence, excess quantities and declines in market value below our cost. A significant percentage of our cost of sales consists of the cost of DRAM and Flash components and wafers. While we have historically received competitive pricing and have had consistent sources of supply for these supplies, we do not have agreements that provide us with fixed pricing or guarantees of supply. Increases in DRAM pricing typically improve our margins, at least in the short term and particularly in our operations in Brazil, as we consume previously purchased inventory. However, declines in DRAM pricing often require us to reduce our prices even as we consume higher priced DRAM inventory, thereby reducing our margins.\nGross Profit\nGross profit and gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the average sales prices of our products, manufacturing and overhead costs, the mix of products sold and our ability to leverage our existing infrastructure as we continue to grow. We expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time depending on the factors described above.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of research and development expense, selling, general and administrative expense and management advisory fees. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses.\nResearch and development expense. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs, consulting costs, allocated overhead and other costs to support our development activities. To date, we have expensed all research and development costs as incurred. We expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our research and product development efforts to enhance our product capabilities and access new customer markets, although such expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total net sales. In order to qualify for certain tax incentives under PADIS and PPB/IT Program in Brazil, we are required to expend a minimum amount on research and development in Brazil.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs, sales commission costs and allocated overhead. We expense sales commission costs as incurred. Sales and marketing expense also includes costs for recruiting and training channel partners, market development programs, promotional and other marketing activities, travel, office equipment and outside consulting costs. We expect sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our sales and marketing headcount in all markets and expand our international operations, although such expense may fluctuate as a percentage of net sales.\nGeneral and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs, facilities and non-manufacturing equipment costs, allowances for bad debt and other support costs, including utilities, insurance and professional fees. We expect that we will incur increased general and administrative expenses as a result of being a publicly-traded company, including significant increased legal and accounting costs related to compliance with rules and regulations implemented by the SEC and NASDAQ, as well as additional insurance, investor relations and other costs associated with being a public company.\nManagement advisory fees. Management advisory fees consist of quarterly fees plus out-of-pocket expenses, which are payable by us to Silver Lake Management Company III, L.L.C. and Silver Lake Management Company Sumeru, L.L.C., affiliates of Silver Lake, or the Managers, under the Amended and Restated Transaction and Management Fee Agreement, or the Management Agreement. We terminated the Management Agreement upon the completion of our initial public offering.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net consists primarily of interest expense on our debt obligations.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net includes gains and losses from foreign currency transactions and other non-operating items.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nWe record income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, we generally consider all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates. We provide valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nWe recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. We then measure the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. In the event that we recognize any unrecognized tax benefits, the effective tax rate will be affected. If recognized, approximately $1.5 million of unrecognized tax benefit would impact the effective tax rate at August 25, 2017. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, we cannot assure that the final tax outcome of these matters will be the same as these estimates. We update these estimates quarterly based on factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, new audit activity and effectively settled issues.\nWe follow specific and detailed guidelines in each tax jurisdiction regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide necessary valuation allowances as required. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the tax law. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and our ability to successfully execute our business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.\nResults of Operations\nThe following is a summary of our results of operations for the periods presented. The period-to-period comparison of results is not necessarily indicative of results for future periods.\nTable 171: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td>

million in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. \nNet Sales, Cost of Sales and Gross Margin\nNet sales increased by $226.9 million, or 42.5%, during fiscal 2017 compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to a 67% higher sales volume of mobile memory products in Brazil in fiscal 2017, which was driven in part by new product introductions of higher density eMCP products and the increase in local content requirements to 50% for mobile memory products for smartphones effective January 1, 2017, as well as a 36% increase in the average selling prices of mobile memory products in Brazil during fiscal 2017 due to density changes. Strategic investments to increase production capacity in prior periods helped enable us to meet the increased demand in the Brazil mobile memory market. Our Brazil PC DRAM and our specialty DRAM sales also increased and were positively impacted by overall strength in the worldwide DRAM market, leading to 53% and 44% higher volumes and 6% and 24% increases in the average selling prices during fiscal 2017, respectively, compared to the prior fiscal year, as well as strength in the server, networking, communications and storage markets.\nCost of sales increased by $171.6 million, or 40.1%, during fiscal 2017 compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase of 43% in the cost of materials for the higher level of sales, as well as higher depreciation in Brazil due to the technology transition from third generation double-data-rate ( DDR3\u201d) Fine-pitch Ball Grid Array ( FBGA\u201d) packaging to fourth generation double-data-rate ( DDR4\u201d) flip chip and higher production costs related to the increased revenue. Included in the cost of sales increase was an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $5.4 million due to locally sourced cost of sales in Brazil.\nGross margin increased to 21.3% during fiscal 2017, compared to 20.0% for fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher Brazil mobile memory and specialty DRAM revenue while cost of sales associated with higher density memory modules increased at a lower rate.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 174: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>

The decrease in net sales was primarily due to 47% lower volume and 32% lower average selling prices of our DRAM products in Brazil due in large part to a major corruption scandal involving Brazil's largest energy company, Petrobras, which began to unfold in calendar 2014, and by calendar 2015 contributed to a significant decrease in the value of the Brazilian real. This led to a substantial downturn in the Brazilian economy toward the end of fiscal 2015, which continued into fiscal 2016. The decrease in net sales was offset in part by a 79% increase in average selling prices and a 15% increase in volume for our mobile memory products in Brazil, as local content requirements for mobile memory products for smartphones increased from 25% to 40% effective January 1, 2016. In addition, our net sales were also negatively impacted by lower worldwide DRAM prices, leading to a 23% decrease in our average selling prices of our specialty DRAM products in fiscal 2016, partially offset by 10% higher volume.\nCost of sales decreased by $84.5 million, or 16.5%, during fiscal 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease in cost of sales was driven primarily by a $73.4 million decrease in the cost of materials due to lower sales. In addition, our factory overhead and other components of cost of sales decreased by $11.1 million, primarily due to lower production costs, personnel-related expenses and depreciation as well as charges for inventory reserves. The cost of sales decrease is net of an offsetting favorable foreign exchange impact of $10.7 million due to locally sourced cost of sales in Brazil. Gross margin remained relatively flat for both periods.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td>

the prior fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to decreased spending as a result of the deteriorating economic conditions in Brazil, lower intangible amortization expense as certain intangible assets were fully amortized in fiscal 2015, as well as an in-process research and development charge of $1.6 million in fiscal 2015, which did not recur in fiscal 2016. Included in the R&D expense decrease was a favorable foreign exchange impact of $3.4 million.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expense decreased by $31.7 million, or 35.6%, during fiscal 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $16.2 million in intangible amortization expense related to assets that were fully amortized in fiscal 2015, lower professional services and personnel-related costs, aggregating $8.9 million, as well as a non-recurring write-off of $4.0 million of deferred public offering costs in fiscal 2015.

Other income (expense), net increased by $7.4 million during fiscal 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily due to an $11.8 million currency gain (mainly in Brazil) arising from transactions not denominated in the functional currency, partially offset by a $4.3 million decrease in fees received in fiscal 2015 under a transition services agreement that we entered into with SanDisk in connection with the sale of the Storage Business as this agreement terminated in fiscal 2015.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> August 26,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> August 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (4,205\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (63.2\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProvision for income taxes decreased by $4.2 million, or 63.2%, during fiscal 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to lower foreign income in certain taxable jurisdictions.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> August 25,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> August 26,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> August 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (933\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,762\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18,027\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13,369\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,716\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16,975\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10,914\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (32,645\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and\ncash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (263\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (227\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,399\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (36,198\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (9,460\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (9,998\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt August 25, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $22.4 million, of which approximately $14.8 million was held outside of the United States.\nOn May 30, 2017, we completed our IPO and raised proceeds, net of underwriting commissions and discounts and other offering costs, of approximately $60.8 million. On June 2, 2017, we used the net proceeds to make a mandatory prepayment of $61.1 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding term loans under the Amended Credit Agreement.\nWe expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents, line of credit and cash generated by operating activities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. Our principal uses of cash and capital resources are debt service requirements as described below, capital expenditures, R&D expenditures and working capital requirements. We expect that future capital expenditures will focus on expanding capacity of our Brazilian operations, expanding our R&D activities, manufacturing equipment upgrades and/or acquisitions and IT infrastructure and software upgrades. Cash and cash equivalents consist of funds held in demand deposit accounts and money market funds. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.\nOperating Activities\nDuring the fiscal 2017, cash used in operating activities was $0.9 million. The primary factors affecting our cash flows during this period were a $61.2 million change in our net operating assets and liabilities and $7.8 million net loss, partially offset by $68.1 million of non-cash related expenses. The $61.2 million change in net operating assets and liabilities consisted of increases of $40.4 million in accounts receivable and $21.9 million in inventory, and decrease of $10.6 million in accounts payable, offset by an increase of $11.7 million in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The increase in accounts receivable was due to lower purchases under our Receivables Purchasing Agreement, while the increase in inventory was due to both higher sales forecast and higher cost of materials resulting from increased DRAM prices.\nDuring fiscal 2016, cash provided by operating activities was $15.1 million. The primary factors affecting our cash flows during this period were $38.6 million of non-cash related expenses, offset by a $20.0 million net loss and a $3.5 million change in our net operating assets and liabilities. The $3.5 million change in operating assets and liabilities consisted of decreases of $44.9 million in accounts receivable, $31.3 million in inventory and $11.0 million in prepaid expenses and other assets, offset by decreases of $86.5 million in accounts payable and $4.2 million in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The decreases in accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable were primarily due to lower gross sales.\nDuring fiscal 2015, cash provided by operating activities was $40.8 million. The primary factors affecting our cash flows during this period were $64.2 million of non-cash related expenses and a $23.1 million change in our net operating assets and liabilities, offset by a $46.5 million net loss. The $23.1 million change in operating assets and liabilities consisted of a decrease of $8.6 million in accounts receivable and an increase of $53.2 million in accounts payable, offset by increases of $20.0 million in inventory and $0.4 million in prepaid expenses and other assets, and a decrease of $18.3 million in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The increases in inventory and accounts payable were primarily due to higher gross sales.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2017 was $18.0 million consisting primarily of $18.7 million used for purchases of property and equipment, offset by $0.7 million proceeds from sale of property and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2016 was $13.4 million consisting primarily of $13.8 million used for purchases of property and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2015 was $8.7 million, primarily resulting from $31.7 million used for purchases of property and equipment, $6.1 million of restricted cash related to our BNDES Credit Agreements in Brazil and $1.6 million used to purchase other assets, offset by $30.5 million of proceeds from the Escrow Release related to the sale of our Storage Business.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2017 was $17.0 million, consisting of $151.9 million payment for extinguishment of long-term debt and debt extension, $61.1 million early payment on term loan, $19.7 million long-term debt payments for both the Amended Credit Agreement and the BNDES Credit Agreements, as well as $3.2 million fees paid for revolver, offset by $157.0 million proceeds from issuance of long-term debt and $62.4 million proceeds from IPO. Net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2016 was $10.9 million, consisting primarily of $16.7 million of long-term debt payments, offset by $5.8 million received under our BNDES Credit Agreements in Brazil. Net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2015 was $32.6 million, consisting primarily of $28.3 million for distribution of share premium to our shareholders in connection with the Escrow Release, $13.3 million of long-term debt payments, $3.1 million for payment of costs related to our IPO, $1.1 million of payments for the cancellation of options related to the Escrow Release and $0.9 million for strike price floor payments to optionholders as equitable adjustments required under the SGH Plan in connection with the Escrow Release, offset by $14.1 million received under our BNDES Credit Agreements in Brazil.\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations as of August 25, 2017 are set forth below:\nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amended Credit Agreement Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 115.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 165.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense in connection with the Amended\nCredit Agreement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BNDES Credit Agreements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense in connection with the BNDES\nCredit Agreements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cancellable product purchase commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 110.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 71.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 134.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 315.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSenior Secured Credit Agreement\nOn August 9, 2017, SMART Worldwide, SMART Modular Technologies (Global), Inc. (Global) and SMART Modular entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (together with all related documents, as amended from time to time, the Amended Credit Agreement) with certain lenders which amended and restated that certain Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as November 5, 2016 (the ARCA), which had amended and restated that certain Credit Agreement dated as of August 26, 2011 (the Original Credit Agreement). The Company's subsidiaries named as borrowers in the Amended Credit Agreement and certain other subsidiaries that entered into a guarantee with respect to the Amended Credit Agreement, are collectively referred to as the Loan Parties and together with SMART Malaysia, the Credit Group. The Amended Credit Agreement provides for $165 million of term loans with a maturity date of August 9, 2022 and $50 million of revolving loans with a maturity date of February 9, 2021 (the Initial Revolver Maturity Date) which revolving loan maturity date automatically extends to February 9, 2022 if the total leverage ratio of the Credit Group is less than 3.0:1.0 on the Initial Revolver Maturity Date. SMART Global Holding is not a party to the Amended Credit Agreement.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement is jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior basis by certain subsidiaries of Global (excluding, among other subsidiaries, SMART Malaysia). In addition, the Amended Credit Agreement is secured by a pledge of the capital stock of, or equity interests in, most of the subsidiaries of SMART Worldwide (including, without limitation, SMART Malaysia) and by substantially all of the assets of the subsidiaries of SMART Worldwide, excluding the assets of SMART Malaysia and certain other subsidiaries.\nCovenants. The Amended Credit Agreement contains various representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants that are usual and customary for loans of this nature including, among other things, limitations on the Credit Group's ability to engage in certain transactions, incur debt, pay dividends, and make investments. The Amended Credit Agreement also requires that the Credit Group maintain a Secured Leverage Ratio not in excess of 3.5:1.0 as of the end of each fiscal quarter (commencing with the fiscal quarter ending November 24, 2017) and puts restrictions on the Credit Group's ability to retain cash proceeds from the sale of certain assets with net proceeds in excess of $2 million, subject to customary six-month reinvestment rights.\nInterest and Interest Rates. Loans under the Amended Credit Agreement accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin plus, at the borrowers' option, either a LIBOR rate, or a base rate. The applicable margin for term loans with respect to LIBOR borrowings is 6.25% and with respect to base rate borrowings is 5.25%. The interest rate on the term loans was 7.57%, 8.25% and 8.25% as of August 25, 2017, August 26, 2016, and August 28, 2015 respectively.\nThe applicable margin for revolving loans adjusts every quarter based on the Secured Leverage Ratio for the most recent fiscal quarter with the applicable margin for revolving loans with respect to LIBOR borrowings ranging from 3.75% to 4.00% and the applicable margin for revolving loans with respect to base rate borrowings ranging from 2.75% to 3.00%. Prior to November 5, 2016, the effective date of the ARCA, the applicable margin was pegged to the Secured Net Leverage Ratio.\nInterest on base rate loans is payable on the last day of each calendar quarter. Interest on LIBOR-based loans is payable every one, two, three, six, nine or twelve months after the date of each borrowing, dependent on the particular interest rate period selected with respect to such borrowing.\nPrincipal Payments. The Amended Credit Agreement requires quarterly repayments of principal under the term loans equal to 2.5% of $165 million, or $4.1 million per fiscal quarter. During fiscal 2017 and 2016, the borrowers made scheduled principal payments of $11.6 million and $13.3 million, respectively.\nPrepayments. The borrowers have the right at any time to make optional prepayments of the principal amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement, provided that prepayments of principal which are voluntary or are made in connection with certain transactions will be subject to prepayment premiums of 3%, 2% and 1% during the first, second and third years, respectively, after the effective date of the Amended Credit Agreement.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement also requires certain mandatory prepayments of principal whereby the borrowers must prepay outstanding loans, subject to certain exceptions, which include, among other things:\n \u2022 75% of excess cash flow on a semi-annual basis if the total leverage ratio is greater than 1.5:1.0, (ii) 50% of excess cash flow on a semi-annual basis if the total leverage ratio is greater than 1.0:1.0 but less than or equal to 1.5:1.0 and (iii) 25% of excess cash flow on an annual basis if the secured leverage ratio is less than or equal to 1.0:1.0., which amounts will be reduced by any permitted voluntary prepayments of principal made in the applicable fiscal year; \n \u2022 100% of the net proceeds of certain asset sales or other dispositions of property of Global or any of its restricted subsidiaries, subject to limited rights to reinvest the proceeds within six months; and \n \u2022 100% of the net cash proceeds of incurrence of certain debt by Global or any of its restricted subsidiaries, other than proceeds from certain debt to be incurred under the Amended Credit Agreement. \nNo mandatory prepayments were required for fiscal 2017.\nOn November 29, 2016, the Credit Group received all required approvals from the lenders and entered into Amendment No. 4 to the Credit Agreement (Amendment 4) dated as of November 5, 2016 (the Amendment 4 Effective Date) which, among other things, adopted the ARCA. Pursuant to Amendment 4, the borrowers agreed to pay the Administrative Agent a fee in the amount of $1 million pursuant to a separate agreement and to pay a fee in the form of an additional term loan, in the amount of $5 million for the ratable account of the term lenders party to Amendment 4. Additionally, SMART Global Holdings was obligated to make an aggregate equity investment of at least $9.9 million in cash in Global, and SMART Global Holdings was obligated to issue 3,467,571 warrants (the\nLender Warrants) to purchase 20% on a pro forma basis, of the then outstanding ordinary shares of SMART Global Holdings, to the term lenders party to Amendment 4, which Lender Warrants were exercisable at $0.03 per share, with 1,541,143 warrants totaling 10% of SMART Global Holdings' then outstanding shares (the First Tranche Warrants) exercisable immediately and 1,926,428 warrants to purchase an additional 10% of SMART Global Holdings' then outstanding shares (the Second Tranche Warrants), exercisable only if there were balances outstanding under the original term loans at the one year anniversary of the Amendment 4 Effective Date. The relative fair value of the Lender Warrants and the fees payable to the lenders in connection with the ARCA were recorded as debt discount and resulted in additional interest expense over the then amended term of the loan using the effective interest method following debt modification accounting.\nUnder the terms of the ARCA, the maturity date of the term loans and the revolving loans was extended from August 26, 2017, to August 26, 2019. If there were balances still outstanding on the original term loans at the one year anniversary of the Amendment 4 Effective Date, the borrowers would have been obligated to pay an additional fee to the term lenders of $5 million in cash. In addition, the ARCA increased the quarterly scheduled principal payments of term loans to $3.9 million per quarter to be paid on the last day of each fiscal quarter starting November 25, 2016. Under the ARCA, early mandatory repayments of principle were applied in the reverse order of maturity.\nOn June 2, 2017, SMART Global Holdings contributed $61.0 million from the proceeds of the IPO, to Global which proceeds Global in turn used to pay down the original term loans as required under the ARCA, resulted in a $6.7 million loss on early repayment"}
