Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and related notes and the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements\u201d this 2021 Form 10-K. As discussed in more detail in the Section entitled Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d this discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nWhile the Company continues to execute its business strategy, the ongoing and prolonged COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted net sales in all major commercial regions around the globe that are important to the Company's business. The COVID-19 pandemic's adverse impact on the global economy has contributed to significant and extended quarantines and other social distancing measures; the increased prevalence of remote working arrangements for employees in certain industries; disruptions in the global supply chain for a number of industries, including consumer retail, and related consumer products shortages and price increases for consumer products; closures, bankruptcies and/or reduced operations of retailers, beauty salons, spas, offices and manufacturing facilities; labor shortages with employers in many industries, including consumer retail, experiencing increased competition to recruit, hire and retain employees; travel and transportation restrictions leading to declines in consumer traffic in key shopping and tourist areas around the globe; and import and export restrictions. These adverse conditions have resulted in the general slowdown of the global economy, in turn contributing to declines in net sales within some of the Company's reporting segments and regions. However, with the roll out of COVID-19 vaccinations in the United States in 2021 and the easing of COVID-19 restrictions in 2021, the Company is seeing a resumption in consumer spending and consumption. The Company continues to closely monitor the impacts of COVID-19 including the impacts of any new variants of COVID-19 and subsequent waves\u201d of the pandemic, and will take appropriate actions in an effort to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic's negative effects on the Company's operations and financial results. See \"COVID-19 Impact on the Company's Business\" below for more details.\nLiquidity and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nEach reporting period, the Company assesses its ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date the financial statements are issued. At December 31, 2021, the Company had a liquidity position of $171.5 million, consisting of: (i) $102.4 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents (with approximately $97.2 million held outside the U.S.); (ii) $72.4 million in available borrowing capacity under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility (which had $289.6 million drawn at such date); and less (iii) approximately $3.3 million of outstanding checks. Under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, as Products Corporation's consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (\"FCCR\") was greater than 1.0 to 1.0 as of December 31, 2021, all of the approximately $72.4 million of availability under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility was available as of such date. The Company's evaluation includes its ability to meet its future contractual obligations and other conditions and events that may impact its liquidity.\nThe Company continues to focus on cost reduction and risk mitigation actions to address both the ongoing and prolonged impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as other risks in the business environment. It expects to generate additional liquidity through continued actions related to the RGGA program and other cost control initiatives as well as funds provided by selling certain assets or other strategic transactions in connection with the Company's ongoing Strategic Review. If sales continue to decline, the Company's cost control initiatives may include reductions in discretionary spend and reductions in investments in capital and permanent displays. Management believes that its recent debt refinancing activities, along with existing cash and cash equivalents and cost control initiatives provides the Company with sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations and maintain business operations for the next twelve months.\nHowever, there can be no assurance that available funds will be sufficient to meet the Company's cash requirements on a consolidated basis, as, among other things, the Company's liquidity can be impacted by a number of factors, including its level of sales, costs and expenditures, as well as accounts receivable and inventory, which serve as the principal variables impacting the amount of liquidity available under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility. For example, subject to certain exceptions, revolving loans under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and term loans under the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility must be prepaid to the extent that outstanding loans exceed the applicable borrowing base, consisting of certain accounts receivable, inventory and real estate.\nREVLON, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCOMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\nOverview\nOverview of the Business\nRevlon, Inc. (\"Revlon\" and together with its subsidiaries, the \"Company\") conducts its business exclusively through its direct wholly-owned operating subsidiary, Revlon Consumer Products Corporation (\"Products Corporation\"), and its subsidiaries. Revlon is an indirect majority-owned subsidiary of MacAndrews & Forbes Incorporated (together with certain of its affiliates other than the Company, \"MacAndrews & Forbes\"), a corporation beneficially owned by Ronald O. Perelman.\nThe Company operates in four brand-centric reporting segments that are aligned with its organizational structure based on four global brand teams: Revlon; Elizabeth Arden; Portfolio; and Fragrances. The Company manufactures, markets and sells an extensive array of beauty and personal care products worldwide, including color cosmetics; fragrances; skin care; hair color, hair care and hair treatments; beauty tools; men's grooming products; anti-perspirant deodorants; and other beauty care products.\nBusiness Strategy\nThe Company remains focused on its 3 key strategic pillars to drive its future success and growth. First, strengthening its iconic brands through innovation and relevant product portfolios; second, building its capabilities to better communicate and connect with its consumers through media channels where they spend the most time; and third, ensuring availability of its products where consumers shop, both in-store and increasingly online. The Company has continued to deliver against the objectives of the Revlon 2020 Restructuring Program (subsequently renamed during 2021 the Revlon Global Growth Accelerator, RGGA\u201d, as herein after defined), which includes rightsizing our organization with the objectives of driving improved profitability, cash flow and liquidity. The Company is also managing the business to conserve cash and liquidity, as well as continuing to focus on stabilizing the business, growing e-commerce and preparing the foundation for achieving future growth.\nStrategic Review\nMacAndrews & Forbes and the Company continue to explore strategic transactions involving the Company and third parties. This review is ongoing and remains focused on exploring potential options for the Company's portfolio and regional brands (the Strategic Review\u201d).\nCOVID-19 Impact on the Company's Business\nWhile the Company continues to execute its business strategy, the ongoing and prolonged COVID-19 pandemic has periodically adversely impacted net sales in all major commercial regions around the globe that are important to the Company's business. COVID-19 has contributed to significant and extended quarantines, stay-at-home orders and other social distancing measures; global supply chain disruptions, including manufacturing and transportation delays, due to closures, employee absences, port congestion, labor and container shortages, and shipment delays, increased transportation costs, tight labor markets and inflationary pressures, closures and bankruptcies of retailers, beauty salons, spas, offices and manufacturing facilities; increased levels of unemployment; travel and transportation restrictions leading to declines in consumer traffic in key shopping and tourist areas around the globe; and import and export restrictions. As the Company currently expects that the COVID-19 pandemic will periodically continue to impact its business going forward, the Company will continue to closely monitor the associated impacts and take appropriate actions in an effort to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic's negative effects on the Company's operations and financial results.\nFor additional information regarding the Company's business, see \"Part 1, Item 1 - Business\" in the Company's 2021 Form 10-K.\nOverview of Net Sales and Earnings Results\nConsolidated net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 were $2,078.7 million, a $174.4 million increase, or 9.2%, compared to $1,904.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $44.7 million favorable FX impact, consolidated net sales increased by $129.7 million, or 6.8%, during the year ended December 31, 2021. The XFX net sales increase of $129.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 was due to: a $49.0 million, or 10.6%, increase in Elizabeth Arden segment net sales; a $43.4 million, or 12.4%, increase in Fragrances segment net sales; a $25.6 million, or 3.7%, increase in Revlon segment net sales; and a $11.7 million or 2.9%, increase in Portfolio segment net sales.\nREVLON, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCOMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\nConsolidated loss from continuing operations, net of taxes, in the year ended December 31, 2021 was $206.9 million, compared to consolidated loss from continuing operations, net of taxes, of $619.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The $412.1 million decrease in consolidated loss from continuing operations, net of taxes, in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to year ended December 31, 2020, was primarily due to:\n\u2022$185.8 million of higher gross profit, primarily due to the higher net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 on net sales during the prior year period;\n\u2022a $152.6 million decrease in the provision for income taxes in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to: the establishment of a valuation allowance on net federal deferred tax assets in the prior year;\n\u2022a $144.1 million decrease in impairment charges attributable to the non-cash impairment charges of $111.0 million and of $33.1 million recorded on the Company's goodwill and on certain of the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets, respectively, following the Company's interim impairment assessments during the year ended December 31, 2020, all of which are primarily attributable to the effects of COVID-19, compared to having no impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2021;\n\u2022a $23.6 million decrease in restructuring charges, primarily related to lower expenditures under RGGA in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the expenditures incurred primarily under the Revlon 2020 Restructuring program (subsequently renamed RGGA) in the year ended December 31, 2020;\n\u2022a $6.9 million net decrease in other miscellaneous expenses, net, in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to financing fees expensed in 2020 in connection with the 2020 BrandCo Refinancing Transactions;\n\u2022a $2.7 million decrease in acquisition, integration and divestiture costs in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by the amortization of the cash-based awards under Tier 1 and Tier 2 of the Revlon 2019 TIP (see Note 12, \"Stock Compensation Plan,\" to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional details on the 2019 TIP); and\n\u2022$0.6 million of higher gain on divested assets primarily related to the sale of certain assets in the year ended December 31, 2021, consisting of the Company's Gatineau brand;\nwith the foregoing partially offset by:\n\u2022$27.3 million of higher SG&A expenses in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by the increased level of activity compared to the prior year, as the Company shows signs of rebound from the negative effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022a $43.1 million decrease in gain on the early extinguishment of debt from the repurchase and cancellation of approximately $157.2 million in aggregate principal face amount of Products Corporation's 5.75% Senior Notes during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to having no gain during the year ended December 31, 2021;\n\u2022$16.6 million of unfavorable variance in foreign currency, resulting from $10.6 million in foreign currency losses during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $6.0 million in foreign currency gains during the year ended December 31, 2020;\n\u2022a $12.8 million increase in amortization of debt issuance costs in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the additional debt issuance costs recorded and amortized in connection with the 2021 and 2020 Refinancing Transactions; and\n\u2022a $4.4 million increase in interest expense in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to higher weighted average interest rates driven primarily by the 2020 BrandCo Term Loan Facility.\nREVLON, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCOMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\nOperating Segments\nThe Company operates in four reporting segments: Revlon; Elizabeth Arden; Portfolio; and Fragrances:\n\u2022Revlon - The Revlon segment is comprised of the Company's flagship Revlon brands.

The Elizabeth Arden segment markets, distributes and sells fragrances, skin care and color cosmetics primarily to prestige retailers, department and specialty stores, perfumeries, boutiques, e-commerce sites, the mass retail channel, travel retailers and distributors, as well as direct sales to consumers via its Elizabeth Arden branded retail stores and elizabetharden.com e-commerce business under brands such as Elizabeth Arden Ceramide, Prevage, Eight Hour, SUPERSTART, Visible Difference and Skin Illuminating in the Elizabeth Arden skin care brands; and Elizabeth Arden White Tea, Elizabeth Arden Red Door, Elizabeth Arden 5th Avenue and Elizabeth Arden Green Tea in Elizabeth Arden fragrances.\n\u2022Portfolio - The Company's Portfolio segment markets, distributes and sells a comprehensive line of premium, specialty and mass products primarily to the mass retail channel, hair and nail salons and professional salon distributors in the U.S. and internationally and large volume retailers, specialty and department stores under brands such as Almay and SinfulColors in color cosmetics; American Crew in men's grooming products (which are also sold direct-to-consumer on its americancrew.com website); CND in nail polishes, gel nail color and nail enhancements; Cutex in nail care products; and Mitchum in anti-perspirant deodorants.

Excluding the $44.7 million favorable FX impact, consolidated net sales increased by $129.7 million, or 6.8%, during the year ended December 31, 2021. The XFX net sales increase of $129.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 was due to: a $49.0 million, or 10.6%, increase in Elizabeth Arden segment net sales; a $43.4 million, or 12.4%, increase in Fragrances segment net sales; a $25.6 million, or 3.7%, increase in Revlon segment net sales; and a $11.7 million or 2.9%, increase in Portfolio segment net sales.\nSegment Results:\nThe Company's management evaluates segment profit for each of the Company's reportable segments. The Company allocates corporate expenses to each reportable segment to arrive at segment profit, as these expenses are included in the internal measure of segment operating performance. The Company defines segment profit as income from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, gains/losses on foreign currency fluctuations, gains/losses on the early extinguishment of debt and miscellaneous expenses. Segment profit also excludes the impact of certain items that are not directly attributable to the segments' underlying operating performance. The Company does not have any material inter-segment sales. For a reconciliation of segment profit to loss from continuing operations before income taxes, see Note 16, \"Segment Data and Related Information,\" to the Company's Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nThe following table provide a comparative summary of the Company's segment results for the periods presented.\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

the year ended December 31, 2021 were $727.9 million, a $39.5 million, or 5.7%, increase, compared to $688.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $13.9 million favorable FX impact, total Revlon segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $25.6 million, or 3.7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The Revlon segment's XFX increase in net sales of $25.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven primarily by higher net sales of Revlon-branded professional hair care products in International regions, and higher net sales of Revlon color cosmetics, primarily in North America. This increase was due, primarily, to retail channels continuing to show signs of improvement from the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as well as salons' increased activity in connection with progressive and/or temporary lifting of restrictions related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by decreased net sales in North America of Revlon ColorSilk and Revlon-branded hair-care products.\nRevlon segment profit in the year ended December 31, 2021 was $86.8 million, a $0.3 million, or 0.3%, increase, compared to $86.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $3.2 million favorable FX impact, Revlon segment profit in the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased by $2.9 million, or 3.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was driven primarily by the Revlon segment's higher brand support and other SG&A expenses, partially offset by higher net sales and slightly higher gross profit margin.\nREVLON, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCOMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\nElizabeth Arden Segment\nElizabeth Arden segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 were $532.3 million, a $68.8 million, or 14.8%, increase, compared to $463.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $19.8 million favorable FX impact, Elizabeth Arden segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $49.0 million, or 10.6%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The Elizabeth Arden segment XFX increase in net sales of $49.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven primarily by higher net sales of Green Tea fragrances, primarily in International regions, and Ceramide skin care products, both in International regions and in North America, and, to a lower extent, higher net sales of White Tea fragrances, as well as other Elizabeth Arden-branded fragrances and skin care products, primarily in International regions. This increase was due, primarily, to growth in e-commerce net sales, as well as an increase in the travel retail business, while there are also signs of improvements from the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on foot traffic at department stores and other retail outlets, and it was partially offset by lower net sales of Prevage.\nElizabeth Arden segment profit in the year ended December 31, 2021 was $62.8 million, a $23.2 million, or 58.6%, increase, compared to $39.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $4.1 million favorable FX impact, Elizabeth Arden segment profit in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $19.1 million, or 48.2%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was driven primarily by the Elizabeth Arden segment's higher net sales and higher gross profit margin, partially offset by higher brand support and other SG&A expenses to support the increase in sales activity.\nPortfolio Segment\nPortfolio segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 were $419.1 million, a $17.8 million, or 4.4%, increase, compared to $401.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $6.1 million favorable FX impact, total Portfolio segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $11.7 million, or 2.9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The Portfolio segment XFX increase in net sales of $11.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven primarily by higher net sales of American Crew men's grooming products, and also by higher net sales in North America of CND nail products and Almay color cosmetics, partially offset by lower net sales of previously sold brands and of certain local and regional skin care products brands, primarily in International regions. The increase was primarily in connection with retail channels continuing to show signs of improvement from the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nPortfolio segment profit in the year ended December 31, 2021 was $71.0 million, a $23.6 million, or 49.8%, increase compared to $47.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $1.3 million favorable FX impact, Portfolio segment profit in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $22.3 million, or 47.0%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was driven primarily by the Portfolio segment's higher net sales and higher gross profit margin, as well as lower SG&A, achieved primarily through RGGA, partially offset by higher brand support expenses to support the increase in sales activity.\nFragrances Segment\nFragrances segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 were $399.4 million, a $48.3 million, or 13.8%, increase, compared to $351.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $4.9 million favorable FX impact, total Fragrances segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $43.4 million, or 12.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The Fragrances segment XFX increase in net sales of $43.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven primarily by higher net sales of Juicy Couture, John Varvatos, Britney Spears and Curve fragrances, partially offset by lower net sales of other distributed fragrances, primarily in North America, primarily due to a recovery from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as retailers are restocking their inventory levels.\nFragrances segment profit in the year ended December 31, 2021 was $72.3 million, a $5.7 million, or 8.6%, increase, compared to $66.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $0.8 million favorable FX impact, Fragrances segment profit in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $4.9 million, or 7.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was driven primarily by the Fragrances segment's higher net sales, as described above, partially offset by the segment's higher brand support and other SG&A expenses primarily due to the increase in sales activity.\nREVLON, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCOMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions, except

Excluding the $2.3 million favorable FX impact, Revlon segment net sales in North America in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $6.1 million, or 1.6%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The Revlon segment's $6.1 million XFX increase in North America net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to the Revlon segment's higher net sales of Revlon color cosmetics, which year-to-date positive performance was driven by the increase in sales experienced during the year ended December 31, 2021, as disclosed elsewhere above, partially offset by lower net sales of Revlon ColorSilk hair color products and Revlon-branded hair-care products.\nInternational\nInternationally, Revlon segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $31.1 million, or 10.1%, to $338.5 million, compared to $307.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.

The Revlon segment's $19.5 million XFX increase in International net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven primarily by the Revlon segment's higher net sales of Revlon-branded professional hair-care products and of Revlon ColorSilk hair color products, primarily in the EMEA region.

This increase was partially offset by lower net sales of certain local and regional skin care products brands and, to a lower extent, of Mitchum anti-perspirant deodorants.\nInternational\nInternationally, Portfolio segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased by $8.3 million, or 5.4%, to $145.1 million, compared to $153.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.

The Portfolio segment's $13.3 million XFX decrease in International net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven primarily by the Portfolio segment's lower net sales of previously sold brands and of certain local and regional skin care products brands. This decrease was partially offset primarily by higher net sales of Mitchum anti-perspirant deodorants and American Crew men's grooming products, primarily in connection with retail channels starting to show signs of improvement from the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nFragrances Segment\nNorth America\nIn North America, Fragrances segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $29.5 million, or 11.6%, to $282.9 million, as compared to $253.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.

The Company renamed the revised program the Revlon Global Growth Accelerator ( RGGA\u201d). RGGA includes a reinvestment strategy to strengthen our brands and drive long-term profitable margin and revenue growth through realized incremental productivity initiatives and enhanced capabilities.\nThe major initiatives underlying the RGGA program include:\n\u2022Strategic Growth: Boost organic sales growth behind our strategic pillars - brands, markets, and channels -- to deliver an approximate mid-single digit compound average annual growth rate through 2023;\n\u2022Operating Efficiencies: Drive additional operational efficiencies and cost savings to fuel investments in revenue growth; and\n\u2022Build Capabilities: Enhance capabilities and up-skill employees in order to evolve our culture to promote agility and deliver transformational change.\nUnder RGGA, the Company expects to deliver an updated range of annualized cost reductions of approximately $275 million to $325 million from 2020 through the end of 2023. Approximately 50% of these annualized cost reductions were realized from the headcount reductions that occurred in 2020. The remaining cost reductions will be realized through reductions in SG&A expenses and cost of goods sold. The Company achieved $57 million of cost reductions during the year ended December 31, 2021, bringing the total cost reductions realized since the inception of the program to approximately $184 million, with the balance to be realized during 2022 and 2023.\nIn connection with implementing RGGA, the Company expects to recognize an updated cost range of approximately $185 million and $205 million of total pre-tax restructuring and related charges, consisting of employee-related costs, such as\nREVLON, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCOMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\nseverance, pension and other termination costs, as well as related third party expenses. The Company also expects to incur approximately $15 million of additional capital expenditures. Under the RGGA program, the Company incurred pre-tax restructuring and related charges of approximately $33.1 million during 2021, $101.9 million cumulative to date, and expects to incur the remainder during 2022 and 2023. The Company expects that substantially all of these restructuring and related charges will be paid in cash, with $95.3 million of the total cumulative charges paid as of December 31, 2021, with the remainder to be paid during 2022 and 2023.\nIn connection with RGGA, during the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded $33.1 million of total pre-tax restructuring and related charges consisting primarily of (i) $26.1 million of employee severance, other personnel benefits and other costs; and (ii) $7.0 million of lease and other restructuring-related charges that were recorded within SG&A and cost of sales. Since its inception and through December 31, 2021, the Company recorded $101.9 million of total pre-tax restructuring and related charges consisting primarily of (i) $76.6 million of employee severance, other personnel benefits and other costs; and (ii) $25.3 million of lease and other restructuring-related charges that were recorded within SG&A and cost of sales.\nSince its inception in March 2020 and through December 31, 2021, approximately 960 positions have been eliminated worldwide under RGGA.\nOn March 2, 2022, the Company announced that it is extending and expanding its existing Revlon Global Growth Accelerator ( RGGA\u201d) program through 2024. The extension and expansion will allow the Company to continue to focus on identifying and implementing new opportunities programmatically. The extension and expansion will provide an additional year to implement larger projects and help make up for supply chain headwinds and the extended COVID restrictions throughout the globe.\nThe major initiatives underlying the RGGA Program will remain and include:\n\u2022Strategic Growth: Boost organic sales growth behind our strategic pillars - brands, markets, and channels -- to deliver mid-single digit Compound Average Annual Growth Rate through 2024.\n\u2022Operating Efficiencies: Drive additional operational efficiencies and cost savings for margin improvement and to fuel investments in growth.\n\u2022Build Capabilities: Build capabilities and embed the Revlon culture of one vision, one team.\nUnder this extension and expansion, the Company expects to deliver an additional range of annualized cost reductions of approximately $50 million to $65 million through the end of 2024. In connection with implementing the extension and expansion, the Company expects to recognize an additional cost range of approximately $8 million to $10 million of total pre-tax restructuring and related charges. The Company also expects to incur approximately $5 million of additional capital expenditures.\nFor further information on the RGGA, see Note 2, \"Restructuring Charges,\" to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.

The ARPA did not have a significant impact on the Company's financial results.\nThe Company's effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was lower than the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the increase in the valuation allowance recorded on the net federal deferred tax assets and the impact of non-deductible impairment charges, which was partially offset by the impact of the \"Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act\" (the \"CARES Act\"), signed into law on March 27, 2020 by President Trump, which resulted in a partial release of a valuation allowance on the Company's 2019 federal tax attributes associated with the limitation on the deductibility of interest.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company concluded that, based on its evaluation of objectively verifiable evidence, it continues to be more likely than not that its net federal deferred tax assets are not recoverable. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the key assumptions used to determine positive and negative evidence included the Company's cumulative taxable income or loss for the past three years, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, the Company's cost reduction initiatives and efficiency efforts, as well as the ongoing and prolonged impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company. Accordingly, the Company recorded a charge of $25.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 ($189.5 million in 2020) as a reserve against its net federal deferred tax assets.\nFor further information, see Note 13, \"Income Taxes,\" to the Company's Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nResults of Operations - Products Corporation\nProducts Corporation's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss are essentially identical to Revlon, Inc.'s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss, except for the following:\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss - Revlon, Inc. </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(206.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(619.0) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Miscellaneous, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss - Products Corporation </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(211.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(593.5) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRefer to Revlon's Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d herein.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company had a liquidity position of $171.5 million, consisting of: (i) $102.4 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents (with approximately $97.2 million held outside the U.S.); (ii) $72.4 million in available borrowing capacity under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility (which had $289.6 million drawn at such date); and less (iii) approximately $3.3 million of outstanding checks. Under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, as Products Corporation's consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (\"FCCR\") was greater than 1.0 to 1.0 as of December 31, 2021, all of the approximately $72.4 million of availability under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility was available as of such date.\nLiquidity and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nEach reporting period, the Company assesses its ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date the financial statements are issued.\nThe Company continues to focus on cost reduction and risk mitigation actions to address the ongoing impact from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as other risks in the business environment. It expects to generate additional liquidity through continued cost control initiatives as well as funds provided by selling certain assets or other strategic transactions in connection with the Company's ongoing Strategic Review. If sales continue to decline, the Company's cost control initiatives may include reductions in discretionary spend and reductions in investments in capital and permanent displays. Management believes that the debt transactions completed during the year ended December 31, 2021, along with existing cash and cash equivalents and cost control initiatives provides the Company with sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations and maintain business operations for the next twelve months.\nHowever, there can be no assurance that available funds will be sufficient to meet the Company's cash requirements on a consolidated basis, as, among other things, the Company's liquidity can be impacted by a number of factors, including its level of sales, costs and expenditures, as well as accounts receivable and inventory, which serve as the principal variables impacting the amount of liquidity available under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility. For example, subject to certain exceptions, revolving loans under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and term loans under the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility must be prepaid to the extent that outstanding loans exceed the applicable borrowing base, consisting of certain accounts receivable, inventory and real estate.\nRecent Debt Transactions\nSecond Quarter of 2021 Financing Transactions\nOn May 7, 2021, Products Corporation entered into Amendment No. 8 to the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement ( Amendment No. 8\u201d). Amendment No. 8, among other things, made certain amendments pursuant to which: (i) the maturity date applicable to the Tranche A\u201d revolving loans and SISO Term Loan Facility (as defined further below in this section within \"Amendment No. 7 to the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement: Tranche A - Revolving Credit Facility and SISO Term Loan Facility\") was extended from June 8, 2023 to May 7, 2024, subject to a springing maturity to the earlier of: (x) 91 days prior to the maturity of the 2016 Term Loan Facility on September 7, 2023, to the extent such term loans are then outstanding, and (y) to the extent the Company's first-in, last-out term loans (the 2020 ABL FILO Term Loans\u201d) are then outstanding, the earliest stated maturity of the 2020 ABL FILO Term Loans; (ii) the commitments under the Tranche A\u201d revolving facility were reduced from $300 million to $270 million and under the SISO Term Loan Facility were upsized from $100 million to $130 million, (iii) the financial covenant was changed from (A)(x) a minimum excess availability requirement of $20 million when the fixed charge coverage ratio is greater than 1.00x or (y) a minimum excess availability requirement of $30 million when the fixed charge coverage ratio is less than 1.00x to (B) a springing minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00x when excess availability is less than $27.5 million, (iv) certain advance rates in respect of the borrowing base under the credit agreement were increased, and (v) the perpetual cash dominion requirement was replaced with a springing cash dominion requirement triggered only when excess availability is less than $45 million. In addition, Amendment No. 8 increased the interest rate margin applicable to the Tranche A\u201d revolving loans to 3.75% from a range of 2.50-3.00% and decreased the LIBOR floor\u201d applicable thereto from 1.75% to 0.50%.\nOn May 7, 2021, the Company also entered into a successor agent appointment and agency transfer agreement pursuant to which MidCap Funding IV Trust (\"MidCap\") succeeded Citibank, N.A. as the collateral agent and administrative agent for the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement. Products Corporation has paid certain customary fees to MidCap and the lenders under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility in connection with Amendment No. 8.\nAmendment No. 8 included an extinguishment, as defined by ASC 470, Debt, with the prior lenders under the Company's Tranche A Revolving Credit facility and the substitution of such lenders under the revolving credit facility with a new lender, MidCap, with which the Company had no prior loans outstanding. In connection with this transaction:\n\u2022Fees of $0.8 million paid to the old lenders that were extinguished under the Tranche A Revolving Credit facility were expensed within SG&A on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the year ended December 31, 2021;\n\u2022Deferred financing costs associated with the extinguished, old lenders prior to the effective date of Amendment No. 8, amounting to approximately $4.7 million, were expensed within \"Amortization of debt issuance costs\u201d on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the year ended December 31, 2021; and\n\u2022Fees of approximately $2.1 million paid to the new lender and third parties were recorded as deferred financing costs and are amortized in accordance with the straight-line method over the revised term of Tranche A through May 7, 2024.\nThe above-mentioned Amendment No. 8 also included an extinguishment and a modification of a term loan in connection with the existing SISO Term Loan Facility. More specifically, in accordance with ASC 470, Debt:\n\u2022Extinguishment accounting was applied to one existing prior lender, which is no longer involved with the SISO Term Loan Facility after Amendment No. 8. In connection with such extinguishment, deferred financing costs of approximately $1.4 million were expensed within \"Amortization of debt issuance costs\u201d on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the year ended December 31, 2021; and\n\u2022Modification accounting was applied to those exiting lenders for which the cash flow effect between the amount owed to them before and after the consummation of Amendment No. 8, on a present value basis, was less than 10% and, thus, the debt instruments were not considered to be substantially different. In connection with such modification, fees of approximately $0.9 million paid to the lenders were recorded as deferred financing costs and are amortized within \"Amortization of debt issuance costs\u201d (together with previously exiting deferred financing costs associated with these lenders of approximately $4.0 million), in accordance with the new effective interest rate computed over the revised term of the SISO Term Loan Facility. Additionally, approximately $0.4 million of fees paid to third parties were expensed within SG&A on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nFirst Quarter of 2021 Financing Transactions\nTranche A - Revolving Credit Facility and SISO Term Loan Facility\nOn March 8, 2021, Products Corporation entered into Amendment No. 7 to the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement ( Amendment No. 7\u201d). Amendment No. 7, among other things, made certain amendments pursuant to which (i) the maturity date applicable to the Tranche A\u201d revolving loans under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement was extended from September 7, 2021 to June 8, 2023, (ii) the commitments under the Tranche A\u201d revolving facility were reduced from $400 million to $300 million and (iii) a new $100 million senior secured second-in, second-out term loan facility maturing June 8, 2023 (the SISO Term Loan Facility\u201d) was established and Products Corporation borrowed $100 million of term loans thereunder. Except as to pricing, maturity, enforcement priority and certain voting rights, the terms of the SISO Term Loan Facility were substantially consistent with the first-in, last-out Tranche B\u201d term loan facility under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement, including as to guarantees and collateral.\nTerm loans under the SISO Term Loan Facility accrue interest at the LIBOR rate, subject to a floor of 1.75%, plus a margin of 5.75%. In addition, Amendment No. 7 increased the interest rate margin applicable to the Tranche A\u201d revolving loans by 0.50% to a range of 2.50% to 3.0%, depending on average excess revolving availability. Products Corporation paid certain customary fees to Citibank, N.A. and the lenders under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility in connection with Amendment No. 7.\nThe above-mentioned Amendment No. 7 represented an exchange of an existing revolving credit agreement with a new revolving credit agreement with the same lenders as defined by ASC 470, Debt, under the revolving credit facility. All pre-existing unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the old revolving credit agreement of approximately $0.8 million were added to the newly incurred deferred financing costs of approximately $4.2 million and their total of approximately $5.1 million will be amortized in accordance with the straight-line method over the term of Tranche A through June 8, 2023. Additionally, approximately $4.3 million of new deferred financing costs were incurred in connection with the SISO Term Loan Facility with the new lenders, which are amortized in accordance with the effective interest method over the term of the facility.\n2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility\nOn March 2, 2021 (the 2021 ABTL Closing Date\u201d), Revlon Finance LLC (the ABTL Borrower\u201d), a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Products Corporation, certain foreign subsidiaries of Products Corporation party thereto as guarantors, the lenders party thereto and Blue Torch Finance LLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent (the ABTL Agent\u201d), entered into an Asset-Based Term Loan Credit Agreement (the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Agreement\u201d, and the term loan facility thereunder, the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility\u201d).\nPrincipal and Maturity: The 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility provides for a U.S. dollar-denominated senior secured asset-based term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $75 million, the full amount of which was funded on the closing of the facility. On the 2021 ABTL Closing Date, approximately $7.5 million of the proceeds of the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility were deposited in an escrow account by the ABTL Agent pending completion of certain post-closing perfection actions with respect to certain foreign real property of the guarantors constituting collateral securing the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility. Such perfection actions were subsequently completed, and the escrowed funds were released to the ABTL Borrower. The 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility has an uncommitted incremental facility pursuant to which it may be increased from time to time by up to the amount of the borrowing base in effect at the time such incremental facility is incurred, subject to certain conditions and the agreement of the lenders providing such increase. The proceeds of the loans under the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility were used: (i) to repay in full the obligations under the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility (the ABTL Refinancing\u201d); (ii) to pay fees and expenses in connection with the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility and the ABTL Refinancing; and (iii) for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility matures on March 2, 2024, subject to a springing maturity date of August 1, 2023 if, on such date, any principal amount of loans under the 2016 Term Loan Agreement due September 7, 2023 remain outstanding.\nThe 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Agreement requires the maintenance of a borrowing base supporting the borrowing thereunder, to be evidenced with the delivery of biweekly borrowing base certificates customary for facilities of this type, with more frequent reporting required upon the triggering of certain events. The borrowing base calculation under the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility is based on the sum of: (i) 80% of eligible accounts receivable; (ii) 65% of the net orderly liquidation value of eligible finished goods inventory; and (iii) 45% of the mortgage value of eligible real property, in each case with respect to certain of Products Corporation's subsidiaries organized in Australia, Bermuda, Germany, Italy, Spain and Switzerland (the ABTL Borrowing Base Guarantors\u201d). The borrowing bases in each jurisdiction are subject to certain customary availability reserves set by the ABTL Agent.\nGuarantees and Security: The 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility is guaranteed by the Borrowing Base Guarantors, as well as by the direct parent entities of each ABTL Borrowing Base Guarantor (not including Revlon, Inc. or Products Corporation) on a limited recourse basis (the ABTL Parent Guarantors\u201d) and by certain subsidiaries of Products Corporation organized in Mexico (the ABTL Other Guarantors\u201d and, together with the ABTL Borrower and the ABTL Borrowing Base Guarantors, the ABTL Loan Parties\u201d). The obligations of the ABTL Loan Parties and the ABTL Parent Guarantors under the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility are secured by first-ranking pledges of the equity of each ABTL Loan Party (other than the Other Guarantors), the inventory and accounts receivable of the ABTL Borrowing Base Guarantors, the material bank accounts of each Loan Party, the material intercompany indebtedness owing to any Loan Party (including any intercompany loans made with the proceeds of the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility) and certain other material assets of the ABTL Borrowing Base Guarantors, subject to customary exceptions and exclusions. The 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility includes a cash dominion feature customary for transactions of this type.\nInterest and Fees: Interest is payable on each interest payment date as set forth in the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Agreement, and in any event at least quarterly, and accrues on borrowings under the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility at a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR rate, with a floor of 1.50%, plus an applicable margin equal to 8.50%. The ABTL Borrower is obligated to pay certain fees and expenses in connection with the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility, including a fee payable to Blue Torch Finance LLC for its services as Agent. Loans under the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility may be prepaid without premium or penalty, subject to a prepayment premium equal to 3.0% of the aggregate principal amount of loans prepaid or repaid during the first year after the 2021 ABTL Closing Date, 2.0% of the aggregate principal amount of loans prepaid or repaid during the second year after the 2021 ABTL Closing Date and 1.0% of the aggregate principal amount of loans prepaid or repaid thereafter.\nAffirmative and Negative Covenants: The 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit the ABTL Loan Parties' ability to, subject to various exceptions and\nqualifications: (i) incur additional debt; (ii) incur liens; (iii) sell, transfer or dispose of assets; (iv) make investments; (v) make dividends and distributions on, or repurchases of, equity; (vi) make prepayments of contractually subordinated or junior lien debt; (vii) enter into certain transactions with their affiliates, including amending certain material intercompany agreements or trade terms; (viii) enter into sale-leaseback transactions; (ix) change their lines of business; (x) restrict dividends from their subsidiaries or restrict liens; (xi) change their fiscal year; and (xii) modify the terms of certain debt. The ABTL Parent Guarantors are subject to certain customary holding company covenants. The ability of the Loan Parties to make certain intercompany asset sales, investments, restricted payments and prepayments of intercompany debt is contingent on certain \"cash movement conditions\" or \"payment conditions\" being met, which among other things, require a certain level of liquidity for the applicable Loan Party to effect such type of transactions. The 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Agreement also contains a financial covenant requiring the ABTL Loan Parties to maintain a minimum average balance of cash and cash equivalents of $3.5 million, tested monthly, based on the last 10 business days of each month, subject to certain cure rights. The 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Agreement also contains certain customary representations, warranties and events of default.\nPrepayments: The ABTL Borrower must prepay loans under the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility to the extent that outstanding loans exceed the borrowing base. In lieu of a mandatory prepayment, the Loan Parties may deposit cash into a designated U.S. bank account with the ABTL Agent that is subject to a control agreement (such cash, the Qualified Cash\u201d). If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the Qualified Cash may be applied, at the ABTL Agent's option, to prepay the loans under the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility. If the borrowing base subsequently exceeds the outstanding loans, the ABTL Borrower can withdraw Qualified Cash from such bank account to the extent of such excess. In addition, the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility is subject to mandatory prepayments from the net proceeds from the incurrence by the Loan Parties of debt not permitted thereunder.\nAs a result of the ABTL Refinancing and the closing of the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility without the participation of MacAndrews & Forbes as a lender, MacAndrews & Forbes' commitment in respect of the New European ABL FILO Facility under the 2020 Restated Line of Credit Facility terminated on the ABTL Closing Date in accordance with its terms.\nThe proceeds from the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility were used to extinguish the entire amount outstanding under the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility as of the closing date, which was due on July 9, 2021. In connection with such extinguishment, approximately $1.0 million of pre-existing unamortized deferred financing costs were expensed within \"Amortization of Debt Issuance Costs\" on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the year ended December 31, 2021. In accordance with the terms of the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Agreement, approximately $13.8 million of the proceeds from the transaction are held in escrow and are recorded within \"Prepaid expenses and other assets\" on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2021.\nThe Company incurred approximately $3.2 million of new debt issuance costs in connection with the closing of the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility, which are amortized within \"Amortization of debt issuance costs\" in accordance with the effective interest method over the term of the facility.\nChanges in Cash Flows\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $120.9 million, compared with $102.5 million at December 31, 2020. The following table summarizes the Company's cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the periods presented:\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(11.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(97.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td>(12.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities </td> <td>44.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>102.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>(2.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash </td> <td>18.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period </td> <td>102.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>104.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period </td> <td>$ </td> <td>120.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>102.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $11.0 million and $97.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, was primarily driven by a lower loss, partially offset by the upfront cash proceeds of $72.5 million obtained in connection with the Helen of Troy License Agreement during 2020.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $10.3 million of net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in cash used in investing activities primarily related to capital expenditures partially offset by the sale of certain assets in 2021.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $44.2 million and $102.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily included:\n\u2022$230.0 million of borrowings under the SISO Term Loan Facility; and\n\u2022$75.0 million of borrowings under the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility;\nwith the foregoing partially offset by:\n\u2022$100.0 million of net repayments under the SISO Term Loan Facility;\n\u2022$58.9 million used to fully repay the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility;\n\u2022$29.3 million of net repayments under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement;\n\u2022$17.9 million of payment of financing costs incurred in connection with the first and second quarters of 2021 refinancing transactions, comprised of: (i) approximately $5.6 million of payments of financing costs incurred in connection with the SISO Term Loan Facility; (ii) approximately $7.0 million of financing costs incurred in connection with the Tranche A revolving credit facility; and (iii) approximately $5.3 million of payments of financing costs incurred in connection with the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility;\n\u2022$15.2 million of interest payments in connection with the troubled debt restructuring accounting treatment of the 2020 Exchange Offer, which were deemed as return of principal to the participating lenders;\n\u2022$13.9 million of repayments under the 2020 BrandCo Facility;\n\u2022$13.7 million of decreases in short-term borrowings and overdraft; and\n\u2022$9.2 million used to partially repay the 2016 Term Loan Facility.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily included:\n\u2022$880.0 million of borrowings under the 2020 BrandCo Term Loan Facility; and\n\u2022$4.3 million of increases in short-term borrowings and overdraft;\nwith the foregoing partially offset by:\n\u2022$200.0 million used to fully repay the 2019 Term Loan Facility;\n\u2022$281.4 million used to repurchase approximately $324.5 million in aggregate principal face amount of Products Corporation's 5.75% Senior Notes;\n\u2022$133.5 million used to partially repay the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement;\n\u2022$122.0 million used to pay financing costs incurred in connection with the 2020 BrandCo Refinancing Transactions and the 2020 Exchange Offer;\n\u2022$31.4 million used to partially repay the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Loan; and\n\u2022$11.5 million used to partially repay the 2016 Term Loan Facility.\nLong-Term Debt Instruments\nFor additional information on the terms and conditions of Products Corporation's various pre-existing debt instruments and financing transactions, including, without limitation, the 5.75% Senior Notes Exchange Offer, the 2020 BrandCo Facilities, 2016 Term Loan Facility, Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility, 2019 Term Loan Facility (which was fully repaid as part of consummating the 2020 BrandCo Refinancing Transactions), 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility (which was fully repaid and refinanced by the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility), 2020 Restated Line of Credit Facility (which was terminated in accordance with its terms on December 31, 2020) and 6.25% Senior Notes, reference should be made Note 8, \"Debt,\" to the Company's Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this 2021 Form 10-K.\nCovenants\nProducts Corporation was in compliance with all applicable covenants under the 2020 BrandCo Credit Agreement, 2016 Credit Agreements, the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Agreement, as well as with all applicable covenants under its 6.25% Senior Notes Indenture, in each case as of December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2021, the aggregate principal amounts outstanding and availability under Products Corporation's various revolving credit facilities were as follows:\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Commitment </td> <td> </td> <td>Borrowing Base </td> <td> </td> <td>Aggregate principal amount outstanding at December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Availability at December 31, 2021 (a) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tranche A Revolving Credit Facility </td> <td>$ </td> <td>270.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>182.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>109.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>72.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 ABL FILO Term Loans </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SISO Term Loan Facility </td> <td>$ </td> <td>130.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>130.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>130.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a) Availability as of December 31, 2021 is based upon the Tranche A Revolving borrowing base then in effect under Amendment No.8 to the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility of $182.0 million which includes a $2.0 million reserve for the shortfall of the borrowing base that supports the 2020 ABL FILO Term Loan compared to the corresponding aggregate principal amount outstanding of $50 million), less $109.6 million then drawn.\nSources and Uses\nThe Company's principal sources of funds are expected to be operating revenues, cash on hand and funds that may be available from time to time for borrowing under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and other permissible borrowings. The 2016 Credit Agreements, the 2020 BrandCo Credit Agreement, the 6.25% Senior Notes Indenture and the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Agreement contain certain provisions that by their terms limit Products Corporation's and its subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, incur additional debt, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe Company's principal uses of funds are expected to be the payment of operating expenses, including payments in connection with the purchase of permanent wall displays; capital expenditure requirements; debt service payments and costs; cash tax payments; pension and other post-retirement benefit plan contributions; payments in connection with the Company's restructuring programs, such as the RGGA Program; severance not otherwise included in the Company's restructuring programs; business and/or brand acquisitions (including, without limitation, through licensing transactions), if any; additional debt and/or equity repurchases, if any; costs related to litigation; and payments in connection with discontinuing non-core business lines and/or exiting and/or entering certain territories and/or channels of trade. For information regarding certain risks related to the Company's indebtedness and cash flows, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - \"A substantial portion of Products Corporation's indebtedness is subject to floating interest rates and the potential discontinuation or replacement of LIBOR could result in an increase to our interest expense.\"\nThe Company's cash contributions to its pension and post-retirement benefit plans in the year ended December 31, 2021 were $22.5 million. The Company expects that cash contributions to its pension and post-retirement benefit plans will be approximately $8.1 million in the aggregate for 2022. For a further discussion, see Note 11, \"Pension and Post-Retirement Benefits,\" to the Company's Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this 2021 Form 10-K.\nThe Company's cash taxes paid in the year ended December 31, 2021 to state and foreign jurisdictions were $9.6 million. The Company expects to pay net cash taxes totaling approximately $0 million to $10 million in the aggregate during 2022. For\na further discussion, see Note 13, \"Income Taxes,\" to the Company's Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this 2021 Form 10-K.\nThe Company's purchases of permanent wall displays and capital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2021 were $24.9 million and $14.2 million, respectively. The Company expects that purchases of permanent wall displays will total approximately $40 million to $45 million in the aggregate during 2022 and expects that capital expenditures will total approximately $15 million to $20 million in the aggregate during 2022.\nThe Company has undertaken, and continues to assess, refine and implement, a number of programs to efficiently manage its working capital, including, among other things, initiatives intended to optimize inventory levels over time; centralized procurement to secure discounts and efficiencies; prudent management of trade receivables and accounts payable; and controls on general and administrative spending. In the ordinary course of business, the Company's source or use of cash from operating activities may vary on a quarterly basis as a result of a number of factors, including the timing of working capital flows. For certain of the Company's other recent cost reduction initiatives, see COVID-19 Impact on the Company's Business\u201d under the Overview section of this \"Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\".\nContinuing to execute the Company's business initiatives could include taking advantage of additional opportunities to reposition, repackage or reformulate one or more brands or product lines, launching additional new products, acquiring businesses or brands (including, without limitation, through licensing transactions), divesting or discontinuing non-core business lines (which may include exiting certain territories), further refining the Company's approach to retail merchandising and/or taking further actions to optimize its manufacturing, sourcing and organizational size and structure. Any of these actions, the intended purpose of which would be to create value through improving the Company's financial performance, could result in the Company making investments and/or recognizing charges related to executing against such opportunities. Any such activities may be funded with operating revenues, cash on hand, funds that may be available from time to time under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, the 2020 Restated Line of Credit Facility, other permissible borrowings and/or other permitted additional sources of capital, which actions could increase the Company's total debt.\nThe Company may also, from time-to-time, seek to retire or purchase its outstanding debt obligations and/or equity in open market purchases, block trades, privately negotiated purchase transactions or otherwise and may seek to refinance some or all of its indebtedness based upon market conditions. Any such retirement or purchase of debt and/or equity may be funded with operating cash flows of the business or other sources and will depend upon prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors, and the amounts involved may be material. (See Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d regarding the Company's recent debt refinancing transactions).\nThe Company expects that operating revenues, cash on hand and funds that may be available from time-to-time for borrowing under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and other permissible borrowings will be sufficient to enable the Company to pay its operating expenses for 2022, including payments in connection with the purchase of permanent wall displays, capital expenditures, debt service payments and costs, cash tax payments, pension and other post-retirement plan contributions, payments in connection with the Company's restructuring programs, such as, currently, primarily the Revlon 2020 Restructuring Program, severance not otherwise included in the Company's restructuring programs, business and/or brand acquisitions (including, without limitation, through licensing transactions), if any, debt and/or equity repurchases, if any, costs related to litigation, discontinuing non-core business lines and/or entering and/or exiting certain territories and/or channels of trade. The Company also expects to generate additional liquidity from strategic initiatives and cost reductions resulting from the implementation of, currently, primarily the RGGA program, and cost reductions generated from other cost control initiatives, as well as funds provided by selling certain assets in connection with the Company's ongoing Strategic Review.\nThere can be no assurance that available funds will be sufficient to meet the Company's cash requirements on a consolidated basis, as, among other things, the Company's liquidity can be impacted by a number of factors, including its level of sales, costs and expenditures, as well as accounts receivable and inventory, which serve as the principal variables impacting the amount of liquidity available under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility. For example, subject to certain exceptions, revolving loans under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and term loans under the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility must be prepaid to the extent that outstanding loans exceed the applicable borrowing base, consisting of certain accounts receivable, inventory and real estate. For information regarding certain risks related to the Company's indebtedness and cash flows, see Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in this 2021 Form 10-K.\nIf the Company's anticipated level of revenues is not achieved because of, among other things, decreased consumer spending in response to weak economic conditions or weakness in the consumption of beauty products in one or more of the Company's segments, whether attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise; adverse changes in tariffs, foreign\ncurrency exchange rates, foreign currency controls and/or government-mandated pricing controls; decreased sales of the Company's products as a result of increased competitive activities by the Company's competitors and/or decreased performance by third-party suppliers, whether due to shortages of raw materials or otherwise; changes in consumer purchasing habits, including with respect to retailer preferences and/or sales channels, such as due to any further consumption declines that the Company has experienced; inventory management by the Company's customers; space reconfigurations or reductions in display space by the Company's customers; retail store closures in the brick-and-mortar channels where the Company sells its products, as consumers continue to shift purchases to online and e-commerce channels; changes in pricing, marketing, advertising and/or promotional strategies by the Company's customers; or less than anticipated results from the Company's existing or new products or from its advertising, promotional, pricing and/or marketing plans; or if the Company's expenses, including, without limitation, for the purchase of permanent displays, capital expenditures, debt service payments and costs, cash tax payments, pension and other post-retirement plan contributions, payments in connection with the Company's restructuring programs (such as the RGGA Program), severance not otherwise included in the Company's restructuring programs, business and/or brand acquisitions (including, without limitation, through licensing transactions), if any, additional debt and/or equity repurchases, if any, costs related to litigation, discontinuing non-core business lines and/or entering and/or exiting certain territories and/or channels of trade, advertising, promotional and marketing activities or for sales returns related to any reduction of space by the Company's customers, product discontinuances or otherwise, exceed the anticipated level of expenses, the Company's current sources of funds may be insufficient to meet the Company's cash requirements.\nAny such developments, if significant, could reduce the Company's revenues and operating income and could adversely affect Products Corporation's ability to comply with certain financial and/or other covenants under the 2020 BrandCo Credit Agreement, 2016 Credit Agreements, the 6.25% Senior Notes Indenture and/or the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Agreement and in such event the Company could be required to take measures, including, among other things, reducing discretionary spending. For further discussion of certain risks associated with the Company's business and indebtedness, see Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" in this 2021 Form 10-K.\nOff-Balance Sheet Transactions\nThe Company does not maintain any off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or others that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on the Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nDiscussion of Critical Accounting Policies\nIn the ordinary course of its business, the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of its financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"U.S. GAAP\"). Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions. It is also possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same set of facts and circumstances, could develop a different conclusion. The Company believes that the following discussion addresses the Company's most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.\nSales Returns:\nThe Company allows customers to return their unsold products when they meet certain company-established criteria as outlined in the Company's trade terms. The Company regularly reviews and revises, when deemed necessary, its estimates of sales returns based primarily upon historical rate of actual product returns, planned product discontinuances, new product launches and estimates of customer inventory and promotional sales, which would permit customers to return products based upon the Company's trade terms. The Company records estimated sales returns as a reduction to sales and cost of sales, and an increase in accrued liabilities and inventories.\nReturned products, which are recorded as inventories, are valued based upon the amount that the Company expects to realize upon their subsequent disposition. The physical condition and marketability of the returned products are the major factors the Company considers in estimating realizable value. Cost of sales includes the cost of refurbishment of returned products. Actual returns, as well as realized values on returned products, may differ significantly, either favorably or unfavorably, from the Company's estimates if factors such as product discontinuances, customer inventory levels or\nREVLON, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCOMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\ncompetitive conditions differ from the Company's estimates and expectations and, in the case of actual product returns, if economic conditions differ significantly from the Company's estimates and expectations. For returned products that the Company expects to resell at a profit, the Company records, in addition to sales returns as a reduction to sales and cost of sales and an increase to accrued liabilities for the amount expected to be refunded to the customer, an increase to the asset account used to reflect the Company's right to recover products. The amount of the asset account is valued based upon the former carrying amount of the product (i.e., inventory), less any expected costs to recover the products. As the estimated product returns that are expected to be resold at a profit do not comprise a significant amount of the Company's net sales or assets, the Company does not separately report these amounts.\nPension Benefits:\nThe Company sponsors both funded and unfunded pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering employees who meet the applicable eligibility requirements. The Company uses several statistical and other factors in an attempt to estimate future events in calculating the liability and net periodic benefit income/cost related to these plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected long-term return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined annually by the Company, within certain guidelines, which assumptions would be subject to revisions if significant events occur during the year. The Company uses December 31st as its measurement date for defined benefit pension plan obligations and plan assets.\nThe Company applies the \"full yield curve\" approach, an alternative approach from the single weighted-average discount rate approach, to calculate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other post-retirement benefits. Under this method, the discount rate assumption was built through the application of specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows for each of the Company's pension and other retirement plans.\nThe Company utilized a 2.59% weighted-average discount rate in 2021 for the Company's U.S. defined benefit pension plans, compared to a 2.18% weighted-average discount rate in 2020. The Company utilized a 1.74% weighted-average discount rate for the Company's international defined benefit pension plans in 2021, compared to a 1.33% weighted-average discount rate selected in 2020. The discount rates are used to measure the benefit obligations at the measurement date and the net periodic benefit income/cost for the subsequent calendar year and are reset annually using data available at the measurement date. The changes in the discount rates used for 2021 were primarily due to observed increases in long-term interest yields on high-quality corporate bonds during 2021. At December 31, 2021, the increase in the discount rates from December 31, 2020 had the effect of decreasing the Company's projected pension benefit obligation by approximately $25.0 million.\nIn selecting its expected long-term rate of return on its plan assets, the Company considers a number of factors, including, without limitation, recent and historical performance of plan assets, the plan portfolios' asset allocations over a variety of time periods compared with third-party studies, the performance of the capital markets in recent years and other factors, as well as advice from various third parties, such as the plans' advisors, investment managers and actuaries. While the Company considered both the recent performance and the historical performance of plan assets, the Company's assumptions are based primarily on its estimates of long-term, prospective rates of return. The difference between actual and expected return on plan assets is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income and the resulting gains or losses are amortized over future periods as a component of the net periodic benefit cost. For the Company's U.S. defined benefit pension plans, the expected long-term rate of return on the pension plan assets used was 4.50% and 5.50% for 2021 and 2020. The weighted-average expected long-term rate of return used for the Company's international plans was 3.46% for 2021 and 3.39% for 2020. For 2021, the actual return on pension plan assets was $33.9 million, as compared with expected return on plan assets of $19.7 million. The resulting net deferred gain of $14.2 million, when combined with gains and losses from previous years,\nREVLON, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCOMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\nwill be amortized over periods ranging from approximately 10 to 30 years. The actual return on plan assets for 2021 was above expectations, primarily due to higher returns from investments in developed equity markets, bank loans and bond yields.\nThe table below reflects the Company's estimates of the possible effects that changes in the discount rates and expected long-term rates of return would have had on its 2021 net periodic benefit costs and its projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2021 for the Company's principal defined benefit pension plans, with all other assumptions remaining constant:\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Effect of </td> <td> </td> <td>Effect of </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 basis points increase </td> <td> </td> <td>25 basis points decrease </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Net periodic benefit costs </td> <td> </td> <td>Projected pension benefit obligation </td> <td> </td> <td>Net periodic benefit costs </td> <td> </td> <td>Projected pension benefit obligation </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(15.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected long-term rate of return </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe rate of future compensation increases is another assumption used by the Company's third-party actuarial consultants for pension accounting for the International defined benefit plans. The rate of future compensation increases is no longer applicable for the Company's U.S. defined benefit plans as the UAW Plan was frozen in 2019 and the Revlon Employees' Retirement Plan and the Revlon Pension Equalization Plan had plan amendments that effectively froze these plans as of December 31, 2009.\nIn addition, the Company's actuarial consultants also use other factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used by the Company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants, among other things. Differences from these assumptions could significantly impact the actual amount of net periodic benefit cost and liability recorded by the Company.\nTo determine the fiscal 2022 net periodic benefit income/cost, the Company is using the \"full yield curve\" approach described above to separately calculate discount rates for each of the service and interest components. The following table represents the weighted average discount rates used in calculating each component of service and interest costs for the Company's U.S. and international defined benefit pension plans:\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>U.S.\nPlans </td> <td> </td> <td>International\nPlans </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest cost on projected benefit obligation </td> <td>2.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.83 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service cost(a)\n</td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>0.36 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest cost on service cost(a)\n</td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>0.21 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a) Service cost and interest on service cost are no longer applicable for the U.S. plans as the UAW Plan was frozen during 2019.\nFor 2022, the Company is using long-term rates of return on pension plan assets of 4.50% and 3.57% for its U.S. and international defined benefit pension plans, respectively. The Company expects that the impact of the changes in discount rates and the return on plan assets in 2022 will result in net periodic benefit cost of $4.6 million for 2022, compared to $4.8 million of net periodic benefit cost in 2021.\nGoodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets:\nIn determining the fair values of net assets acquired, including trade names, customer relationships and other intangible assets, and resulting goodwill related to the Company's business acquisitions, the Company considers, among other factors, the analyses of historical financial performance and an estimate of the future performance of the acquired business. The fair values of the acquired intangible assets are primarily calculated using a discounted cash flow approach.\nDetermining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions based on evaluating a number of factors, such as marketplace participants, product life cycles, consumer awareness, brand history and future expansion expectations. There are significant judgments inherent in a discounted cash flow approach, including in selecting appropriate discount rates, hypothetical royalty rates, contributory asset capital charges, estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and identifying appropriate terminal growth rate assumptions. The discount rates used in discounted cash flow analyses are intended to reflect the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows generated by the respective acquired intangible assets.\nREVLON, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCOMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\nDetermining an acquired intangible asset's useful life requires management judgment and is based on evaluating a number of factors, including the expected use of the asset, consumer awareness, trade name history and future expansion expectations, as well as any contractual provisions that could limit or extend an asset's useful life. The Company believes that an acquired trade name has an indefinite life if it has a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance, and the Company has the intent and ability to support the trade name with marketplace spending for the foreseeable future. If this indefinite-lived criteria is not met, acquired trade names are amortized over their expected useful lives, which generally range from 5 to 20 years.\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company implemented its brand-centric organizational structure which is built around four global brand teams: Revlon; Elizabeth Arden; Portfolio; and Fragrances, which also represent the Company's reporting segments. Concurrent with the change in reporting segments, goodwill was reassigned to the affected reporting units that have been identified within each reporting segment using a relative fair value allocation approach as outlined in Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. Goodwill totaled $562.8 million and $563.7 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, goodwill of $265.0 million, $87.8 million, $89.3 million and $120.7 million related to the Revlon, Portfolio, Elizabeth Arden and Fragrances segments, respectively. Indefinite-lived intangibles totaled $111.6 million and $115.9 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nIn accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\"), Accounting Standard Codification (\"ASC\") 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (\"ASC 350\"), goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but rather are reviewed annually for impairment using October 1st carrying values, or when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the current carrying amounts may not be recovered. Under this standard, the Company annually has the option to first assess qualitatively, based on relevant events and circumstances, whether it is more likely than not that there has been an impairment, or perform a quantitative analysis to assess the existence of any such impairment. If the qualitative analysis shows that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is higher than its carrying amount, the quantitative analysis is not required. If the qualitative analysis fails, the quantitative analysis is required. Per the simplified approach allowed under ASU No. 2017-04, \"Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,\" adopted by the Company as of October 1, 2018, if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, the goodwill impairment charge is equal to the amount of such difference. The inputs and assumptions utilized in the analyses are classified as Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level.\nThe Company establishes its reporting units based on its current reporting structure, product characteristics and management. Within each of the Elizabeth Arden and Portfolio segments, the Company has identified two reporting units. The two reporting units within the Elizabeth Arden segment are: (i) Elizabeth Arden Skin and Color, which includes Elizabeth Arden skin care and color cosmetics brands; and (ii) Elizabeth Arden Fragrances, which includes Elizabeth Arden branded fragrances. The two reporting units within the Portfolio segment are: (i) Mass Portfolio, which includes the Company's brands sold primarily through the mass retail channel; and (ii) Professional Portfolio, which includes the Company's brands sold primarily through professional salons. The Company's Revlon and Fragrances reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in Note 16, \"Segment Data and Related Information,\" in the Company's Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this 2021 Form 10-K. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to each reporting unit to the extent that goodwill relates to each reporting unit.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, consisting of certain trade names, are not amortized, but rather are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter using October 1st carrying values similar to goodwill, in accordance with ASC 350, and the Company recognizes an impairment if the carrying amount of its intangible assets exceeds its fair value. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values. The Company writes off the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization for intangible assets in the year in which the asset becomes fully amortized.\nFinite-lived intangible assets are considered for impairment under ASC 360-10, Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (\"ASC 360\"), upon the occurrence of certain \"triggering events\" and the Company recognizes an impairment if the carrying amount of the long-lived asset group exceeds the Company's estimate of the asset group's undiscounted future cash flows.\nImpairment testing\nGoodwill Impairment Testing\nFor 2021, in assessing whether goodwill was impaired in connection with its annual impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2021 using October 1st, 2021 carrying values, the Company, in accordance with ASC 350, performed a\nREVLON, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCOMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\nqualitative assessment for its Revlon reporting unit and a quantitative assessment for its (i) Elizabeth Arden Skin & Color, (ii) Elizabeth Arden Fragrances, (iii) Professional Portfolio and (iv) Fragrances reporting units. The Mass Portfolio reporting unit's goodwill was written down to nil during the first quarter of 2020.\nIn performing its 2021 annual qualitative goodwill assessment, the Company considered, among other factors, the financial performance of the Revlon reporting unit, expected future cash flows and the results of previous quantitative assessments of the Revlon reporting unit. Based upon such assessment, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of its Revlon reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying amount for 2021.\nIn performing its 2021 quantitative goodwill assessments, the Company used the simplified approach allowed under ASU No. 2017-04 to test its (i) Elizabeth Arden Skin and Color, (ii) Elizabeth Arden Fragrances, (iii) Professional Portfolio and (iv) Fragrances reporting units for impairment. Based upon such assessment, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of such aforementioned reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts for 2021.\nThe fair values of the aforementioned Company's reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 33% to approximately 119% as of the October 1, 2021 valuation date.\nThe above-mentioned fair values were primarily determined using a weighted average market and income approach. The income approach requires several assumptions including those regarding future sales growth, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margins, and capital expenditures, which are the basis for the information used in the discounted cash flow model. The weighted-average cost of capital used in the income approach ranged from 8.5% to 10.0%, with a perpetual growth rate of 2%. For the market approach, the Company considered the market comparable method based upon total enterprise value multiples of other comparable publicly-traded companies.\nThe key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair values of the Company's reporting units for its annual assessment included the expected success of the Company's future new product launches, the Company's achievement of its expansion plans, the Company's realization of its cost reduction initiatives and other efficiency efforts, as well as certain assumptions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic's expected impact on the Company. If such plans and assumptions do not materialize as anticipated, or if there are further challenges in the business environment in which the Company's reporting units operate, a resulting change in actual results from the Company's key assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values of the reporting units, which could require the Company to recognize additional impairment charges in future reporting periods.\nDuring 2020, the Company performed interim goodwill impairment analyses during the first, second and third quarters of the year, which resulted in the recognition of $99.8 million and $11.2 million of non-cash goodwill impairment charges in the first and second quarter of 2020, respectively, as further specified in Note 6, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net\" to the Company's Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this 2021 Form 10-K.\nIn performing its 2020 annual qualitative goodwill assessment, the Company considered, among other factors, the financial performance of the Revlon reporting unit, the Company's revised expected future cash flows as affected by the ongoing and prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the results of the second quarter of 2020 quantitative interim analysis. Based upon such assessment, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of its Revlon reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying amount for 2020.\nIn performing its 2020 quantitative assessments, the Company used the simplified approach allowed under ASU No. 2017-04 to test its (i) Elizabeth Arden Skin and Color, (ii) Elizabeth Arden Fragrances, (iii) Fragrances, and (iv) Professional Portfolio reporting units for impairment. Based upon such assessment, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of such aforementioned reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts for 2020.\nFinite and Indefinite-lived Intangibles Impairment Testing\nFor 2021, no impairment was recognized related to the carrying value of any of the Company's finite or indefinite-lived intangible assets as a result of the annual impairment testing.\nThe fair values determined as part of the Company's indefinite-lived intangibles quantitative analysis exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 16% to approximately 129% as of the October 1, 2021 valuation date.\nDuring 2020, in connection with the interim goodwill impairment assessments during the first, second and third quarters of 2020, the Company also reviewed indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment. These interim reviews resulted in no interim impairment charges in connection with the carrying value of any of the Company's finite-lived intangible assets and in $24.5 million and $8.6 million of interim non-cash impairment charges in the first and second quarter of 2020,\nREVLON, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCOMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\nrespectively, in connection with the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets, as further specified in Note 6, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net\" to the Company's Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this 2021 Form 10-K.\nSee Note 6, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net,\" to the Company's Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this 2021 Form 10-K for further information on the Company's goodwill and intangible assets.\nIncome Taxes:\nThe Company records income taxes based on amounts payable with respect to the current year and includes the effect of deferred taxes. The effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates, tax-planning opportunities that may be available in various jurisdictions in which the Company operates and the Company's estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues. Determining the Company's tax expense and evaluating tax positions requires significant judgment.\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which management expects that the Company will recover or settle those differences. The realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. The Company establishes a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when management determines that it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize a tax benefit for the deferred tax assets. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require the Company to record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets on which a valuation allowance was not previously established. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Provision for Income Taxes,\" for further information.\nThe Company recognizes a tax position in its financial statements when management determines that it was more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the merits of such position. The Company recognizes liabilities for unrecognized tax positions in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts is ultimately not required, the reversal of the liabilities would result in additional tax benefits recognized in the period in which the Company determines that the liabilities are no longer required. If the estimate of tax liabilities is ultimately less than the final assessment, this will result in a further charge to expense. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company is indefinitely reinvested in the accumulated undistributed earnings of all of its foreign subsidiaries. If earnings are repatriated, any excess of financial reporting over tax basis could be subject to federal, state and foreign withholding taxes. At this time, the determination of deferred tax liabilities on the amount of financial reporting over tax basis is not practicable.\nSee Note 13, \"Income Taxes,\" to the Company's Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this 2021 Form 10-K for further information.\nRecently Evaluated and/or Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1., \"Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" to the Company's Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this 2021 Form 10-K for further information.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1., \"Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" to the Company's Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this 2021 Form 10-K for further information.\nInflation\nThe Company's costs are affected by inflation and the effects of inflation that the Company may experience in future periods. The Company attempts to mitigate the effects of inflation by increasing prices in line with inflation, where possible, and efficiently managing its costs and working capital levels.\nREVLON, INC.

Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and related notes and the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements\u201d this 2021 Form 10-K. As discussed in more detail in the Section entitled Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d this discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nWhile the Company continues to execute its business strategy, the ongoing and prolonged COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted net sales in all major commercial regions around the globe that are important to the Company's business. The COVID-19 pandemic's adverse impact on the global economy has contributed to significant and extended quarantines and other social distancing measures; the increased prevalence of remote working arrangements for employees in certain industries; disruptions in the global supply chain for a number of industries, including consumer retail, and related consumer products shortages and price increases for consumer products; closures, bankruptcies and/or reduced operations of retailers, beauty salons, spas, offices and manufacturing facilities; labor shortages with employers in many industries, including consumer retail, experiencing increased competition to recruit, hire and retain employees; travel and transportation restrictions leading to declines in consumer traffic in key shopping and tourist areas around the globe; and import and export restrictions. These adverse conditions have resulted in the general slowdown of the global economy, in turn contributing to declines in net sales within some of the Company's reporting segments and regions. However, with the roll out of COVID-19 vaccinations in the United States in 2021 and the easing of COVID-19 restrictions in 2021, the Company is seeing a resumption in consumer spending and consumption. The Company continues to closely monitor the impacts of COVID-19 including the impacts of any new variants of COVID-19 and subsequent waves\u201d of the pandemic, and will take appropriate actions in an effort to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic's negative effects on the Company's operations and financial results. See \"COVID-19 Impact on the Company's Business\" below for more details.\nLiquidity and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nEach reporting period, the Company assesses its ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date the financial statements are issued. At December 31, 2021, the Company had a liquidity position of $171.5 million, consisting of: (i) $102.4 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents (with approximately $97.2 million held outside the U.S.); (ii) $72.4 million in available borrowing capacity under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility (which had $289.6 million drawn at such date); and less (iii) approximately $3.3 million of outstanding checks. Under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, as Products Corporation's consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (\"FCCR\") was greater than 1.0 to 1.0 as of December 31, 2021, all of the approximately $72.4 million of availability under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility was available as of such date. The Company's evaluation includes its ability to meet its future contractual obligations and other conditions and events that may impact its liquidity.\nThe Company continues to focus on cost reduction and risk mitigation actions to address both the ongoing and prolonged impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as other risks in the business environment. It expects to generate additional liquidity through continued actions related to the RGGA program and other cost control initiatives as well as funds provided by selling certain assets or other strategic transactions in connection with the Company's ongoing Strategic Review. If sales continue to decline, the Company's cost control initiatives may include reductions in discretionary spend and reductions in investments in capital and permanent displays. Management believes that its recent debt refinancing activities, along with existing cash and cash equivalents and cost control initiatives provides the Company with sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations and maintain business operations for the next twelve months.\nHowever, there can be no assurance that available funds will be sufficient to meet the Company's cash requirements on a consolidated basis, as, among other things, the Company's liquidity can be impacted by a number of factors, including its level of sales, costs and expenditures, as well as accounts receivable and inventory, which serve as the principal variables impacting the amount of liquidity available under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility. For example, subject to certain exceptions, revolving loans under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and term loans under the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility must be prepaid to the extent that outstanding loans exceed the applicable borrowing base, consisting of certain accounts receivable, inventory and real estate.\nREVLON, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCOMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\nOverview\nOverview of the Business\nRevlon, Inc. (\"Revlon\" and together with its subsidiaries, the \"Company\") conducts its business exclusively through its direct wholly-owned operating subsidiary, Revlon Consumer Products Corporation (\"Products Corporation\"), and its subsidiaries. Revlon is an indirect majority-owned subsidiary of MacAndrews & Forbes Incorporated (together with certain of its affiliates other than the Company, \"MacAndrews & Forbes\"), a corporation beneficially owned by Ronald O. Perelman.\nThe Company operates in four brand-centric reporting segments that are aligned with its organizational structure based on four global brand teams: Revlon; Elizabeth Arden; Portfolio; and Fragrances. The Company manufactures, markets and sells an extensive array of beauty and personal care products worldwide, including color cosmetics; fragrances; skin care; hair color, hair care and hair treatments; beauty tools; men's grooming products; anti-perspirant deodorants; and other beauty care products.\nBusiness Strategy\nThe Company remains focused on its 3 key strategic pillars to drive its future success and growth. First, strengthening its iconic brands through innovation and relevant product portfolios; second, building its capabilities to better communicate and connect with its consumers through media channels where they spend the most time; and third, ensuring availability of its products where consumers shop, both in-store and increasingly online. The Company has continued to deliver against the objectives of the Revlon 2020 Restructuring Program (subsequently renamed during 2021 the Revlon Global Growth Accelerator, RGGA\u201d, as herein after defined), which includes rightsizing our organization with the objectives of driving improved profitability, cash flow and liquidity. The Company is also managing the business to conserve cash and liquidity, as well as continuing to focus on stabilizing the business, growing e-commerce and preparing the foundation for achieving future growth.\nStrategic Review\nMacAndrews & Forbes and the Company continue to explore strategic transactions involving the Company and third parties. This review is ongoing and remains focused on exploring potential options for the Company's portfolio and regional brands (the Strategic Review\u201d).\nCOVID-19 Impact on the Company's Business\nWhile the Company continues to execute its business strategy, the ongoing and prolonged COVID-19 pandemic has periodically adversely impacted net sales in all major commercial regions around the globe that are important to the Company's business. COVID-19 has contributed to significant and extended quarantines, stay-at-home orders and other social distancing measures; global supply chain disruptions, including manufacturing and transportation delays, due to closures, employee absences, port congestion, labor and container shortages, and shipment delays, increased transportation costs, tight labor markets and inflationary pressures, closures and bankruptcies of retailers, beauty salons, spas, offices and manufacturing facilities; increased levels of unemployment; travel and transportation restrictions leading to declines in consumer traffic in key shopping and tourist areas around the globe; and import and export restrictions. As the Company currently expects that the COVID-19 pandemic will periodically continue to impact its business going forward, the Company will continue to closely monitor the associated impacts and take appropriate actions in an effort to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic's negative effects on the Company's operations and financial results.\nFor additional information regarding the Company's business, see \"Part 1, Item 1 - Business\" in the Company's 2021 Form 10-K.\nOverview of Net Sales and Earnings Results\nConsolidated net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 were $2,078.7 million, a $174.4 million increase, or 9.2%, compared to $1,904.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $44.7 million favorable FX impact, consolidated net sales increased by $129.7 million, or 6.8%, during the year ended December 31, 2021. The XFX net sales increase of $129.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 was due to: a $49.0 million, or 10.6%, increase in Elizabeth Arden segment net sales; a $43.4 million, or 12.4%, increase in Fragrances segment net sales; a $25.6 million, or 3.7%, increase in Revlon segment net sales; and a $11.7 million or 2.9%, increase in Portfolio segment net sales.\nREVLON, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCOMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\nConsolidated loss from continuing operations, net of taxes, in the year ended December 31, 2021 was $206.9 million, compared to consolidated loss from continuing operations, net of taxes, of $619.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The $412.1 million decrease in consolidated loss from continuing operations, net of taxes, in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to year ended December 31, 2020, was primarily due to:\n\u2022$185.8 million of higher gross profit, primarily due to the higher net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 on net sales during the prior year period;\n\u2022a $152.6 million decrease in the provision for income taxes in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to: the establishment of a valuation allowance on net federal deferred tax assets in the prior year;\n\u2022a $144.1 million decrease in impairment charges attributable to the non-cash impairment charges of $111.0 million and of $33.1 million recorded on the Company's goodwill and on certain of the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets, respectively, following the Company's interim impairment assessments during the year ended December 31, 2020, all of which are primarily attributable to the effects of COVID-19, compared to having no impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2021;\n\u2022a $23.6 million decrease in restructuring charges, primarily related to lower expenditures under RGGA in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the expenditures incurred primarily under the Revlon 2020 Restructuring program (subsequently renamed RGGA) in the year ended December 31, 2020;\n\u2022a $6.9 million net decrease in other miscellaneous expenses, net, in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to financing fees expensed in 2020 in connection with the 2020 BrandCo Refinancing Transactions;\n\u2022a $2.7 million decrease in acquisition, integration and divestiture costs in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by the amortization of the cash-based awards under Tier 1 and Tier 2 of the Revlon 2019 TIP (see Note 12, \"Stock Compensation Plan,\" to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional details on the 2019 TIP); and\n\u2022$0.6 million of higher gain on divested assets primarily related to the sale of certain assets in the year ended December 31, 2021, consisting of the Company's Gatineau brand;\nwith the foregoing partially offset by:\n\u2022$27.3 million of higher SG&A expenses in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by the increased level of activity compared to the prior year, as the Company shows signs of rebound from the negative effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022a $43.1 million decrease in gain on the early extinguishment of debt from the repurchase and cancellation of approximately $157.2 million in aggregate principal face amount of Products Corporation's 5.75% Senior Notes during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to having no gain during the year ended December 31, 2021;\n\u2022$16.6 million of unfavorable variance in foreign currency, resulting from $10.6 million in foreign currency losses during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $6.0 million in foreign currency gains during the year ended December 31, 2020;\n\u2022a $12.8 million increase in amortization of debt issuance costs in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the additional debt issuance costs recorded and amortized in connection with the 2021 and 2020 Refinancing Transactions; and\n\u2022a $4.4 million increase in interest expense in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to higher weighted average interest rates driven primarily by the 2020 BrandCo Term Loan Facility.\nREVLON, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCOMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\nOperating Segments\nThe Company operates in four reporting segments: Revlon; Elizabeth Arden; Portfolio; and Fragrances:\n\u2022Revlon - The Revlon segment is comprised of the Company's flagship Revlon brands. Revlon segment products are primarily marketed, distributed and sold in the mass retail channel, large volume retailers, chain drug and food stores, chemist shops, hypermarkets, general merchandise stores, e-commerce sites, television shopping, department stores, professional hair and nail salons, one-stop shopping beauty retailers and specialty cosmetic stores in the U.S. and internationally under brands such as Revlon in color cosmetics; Revlon ColorSilk and Revlon Professional in hair color; and Revlon in beauty tools.\n\u2022Elizabeth Arden - The Elizabeth Arden segment is comprised of the Company's Elizabeth Arden branded products. The Elizabeth Arden segment markets, distributes and sells fragrances, skin care and color cosmetics primarily to prestige retailers, department and specialty stores, perfumeries, boutiques, e-commerce sites, the mass retail channel, travel retailers and distributors, as well as direct sales to consumers via its Elizabeth Arden branded retail stores and elizabetharden.com e-commerce business under brands such as Elizabeth Arden Ceramide, Prevage, Eight Hour, SUPERSTART, Visible Difference and Skin Illuminating in the Elizabeth Arden skin care brands; and Elizabeth Arden White Tea, Elizabeth Arden Red Door, Elizabeth Arden 5th Avenue and Elizabeth Arden Green Tea in Elizabeth Arden fragrances.\n\u2022Portfolio - The Company's Portfolio segment markets, distributes and sells a comprehensive line of premium, specialty and mass products primarily to the mass retail channel, hair and nail salons and professional salon distributors in the U.S. and internationally and large volume retailers, specialty and department stores under brands such as Almay and SinfulColors in color cosmetics; American Crew in men's grooming products (which are also sold direct-to-consumer on its americancrew.com website); CND in nail polishes, gel nail color and nail enhancements; Cutex in nail care products; and Mitchum in anti-perspirant deodorants. The Portfolio segment also includes a multi-cultural hair care line consisting of Creme of Nature hair care products, which are sold in both professional salons and in large volume retailers and other retailers, primarily in the U.S.; and a hair color line under the Llongueras brand (licensed from a third party) that is sold in the mass retail channel, large volume retailers and other retailers, primarily in Spain.\n\u2022Fragrances - The Fragrances segment includes the development, marketing and distribution of certain owned and licensed fragrances, as well as the distribution of prestige fragrance brands owned by third parties. These products are typically sold to retailers in the U.S. and internationally, including prestige retailers, specialty stores, e-commerce sites, the mass retail channel, travel retailers and other international retailers. The owned and licensed fragrances include brands such as: (i) Juicy Couture (which are also sold direct-to-consumer on its juicycouturebeauty.com website), John Varvatos and AllSaints in prestige fragrances; (ii) Britney Spears, Elizabeth Taylor, Christina Aguilera, Jennifer Aniston and Mariah Carey in celebrity fragrances; and (iii) Curve, Giorgio Beverly Hills, Ed Hardy, Charlie, Lucky Brand, \u2039PS\u203a (logo of former Paul Sebastian brand), Alfred Sung, Halston, Geoffrey Beene and White Diamonds in mass fragrances.\nREVLON, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCOMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\nResults of Operations - Revlon, Inc.\nConsolidated Net Sales:\nConsolidated net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 were $2,078.7 million, a $174.4 million increase, or 9.2%, compared to $1,904.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $44.7 million favorable FX impact, consolidated net sales increased by $129.7 million, or 6.8%, during the year ended December 31, 2021. The XFX net sales increase of $129.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 was due to: a $49.0 million, or 10.6%, increase in Elizabeth Arden segment net sales; a $43.4 million, or 12.4%, increase in Fragrances segment net sales; a $25.6 million, or 3.7%, increase in Revlon segment net sales; and a $11.7 million or 2.9%, increase in Portfolio segment net sales.\nSegment Results:\nThe Company's management evaluates segment profit for each of the Company's reportable segments. The Company allocates corporate expenses to each reportable segment to arrive at segment profit, as these expenses are included in the internal measure of segment operating performance. The Company defines segment profit as income from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, gains/losses on foreign currency fluctuations, gains/losses on the early extinguishment of debt and miscellaneous expenses. Segment profit also excludes the impact of certain items that are not directly attributable to the segments' underlying operating performance. The Company does not have any material inter-segment sales. For a reconciliation of segment profit to loss from continuing operations before income taxes, see Note 16, \"Segment Data and Related Information,\" to the Company's Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nThe following table provide a comparative summary of the Company's segment results for the periods presented.\n \n\n(a) XFX excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\nRevlon Segment\nRevlon segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 were $727.9 million, a $39.5 million, or 5.7%, increase, compared to $688.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $13.9 million favorable FX impact, total Revlon segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $25.6 million, or 3.7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The Revlon segment's XFX increase in net sales of $25.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven primarily by higher net sales of Revlon-branded professional hair care products in International regions, and higher net sales of Revlon color cosmetics, primarily in North America. This increase was due, primarily, to retail channels continuing to show signs of improvement from the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as well as salons' increased activity in connection with progressive and/or temporary lifting of restrictions related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by decreased net sales in North America of Revlon ColorSilk and Revlon-branded hair-care products.\nRevlon segment profit in the year ended December 31, 2021 was $86.8 million, a $0.3 million, or 0.3%, increase, compared to $86.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $3.2 million favorable FX impact, Revlon segment profit in the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased by $2.9 million, or 3.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was driven primarily by the Revlon segment's higher brand support and other SG&A expenses, partially offset by higher net sales and slightly higher gross profit margin.\nREVLON, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCOMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\nElizabeth Arden Segment\nElizabeth Arden segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 were $532.3 million, a $68.8 million, or 14.8%, increase, compared to $463.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $19.8 million favorable FX impact, Elizabeth Arden segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $49.0 million, or 10.6%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The Elizabeth Arden segment XFX increase in net sales of $49.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven primarily by higher net sales of Green Tea fragrances, primarily in International regions, and Ceramide skin care products, both in International regions and in North America, and, to a lower extent, higher net sales of White Tea fragrances, as well as other Elizabeth Arden-branded fragrances and skin care products, primarily in International regions. This increase was due, primarily, to growth in e-commerce net sales, as well as an increase in the travel retail business, while there are also signs of improvements from the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on foot traffic at department stores and other retail outlets, and it was partially offset by lower net sales of Prevage.\nElizabeth Arden segment profit in the year ended December 31, 2021 was $62.8 million, a $23.2 million, or 58.6%, increase, compared to $39.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $4.1 million favorable FX impact, Elizabeth Arden segment profit in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $19.1 million, or 48.2%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was driven primarily by the Elizabeth Arden segment's higher net sales and higher gross profit margin, partially offset by higher brand support and other SG&A expenses to support the increase in sales activity.\nPortfolio Segment\nPortfolio segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 were $419.1 million, a $17.8 million, or 4.4%, increase, compared to $401.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $6.1 million favorable FX impact, total Portfolio segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $11.7 million, or 2.9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The Portfolio segment XFX increase in net sales of $11.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven primarily by higher net sales of American Crew men's grooming products, and also by higher net sales in North America of CND nail products and Almay color cosmetics, partially offset by lower net sales of previously sold brands and of certain local and regional skin care products brands, primarily in International regions. The increase was primarily in connection with retail channels continuing to show signs of improvement from the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nPortfolio segment profit in the year ended December 31, 2021 was $71.0 million, a $23.6 million, or 49.8%, increase compared to $47.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $1.3 million favorable FX impact, Portfolio segment profit in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $22.3 million, or 47.0%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was driven primarily by the Portfolio segment's higher net sales and higher gross profit margin, as well as lower SG&A, achieved primarily through RGGA, partially offset by higher brand support expenses to support the increase in sales activity.\nFragrances Segment\nFragrances segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 were $399.4 million, a $48.3 million, or 13.8%, increase, compared to $351.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $4.9 million favorable FX impact, total Fragrances segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $43.4 million, or 12.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The Fragrances segment XFX increase in net sales of $43.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven primarily by higher net sales of Juicy Couture, John Varvatos, Britney Spears and Curve fragrances, partially offset by lower net sales of other distributed fragrances, primarily in North America, primarily due to a recovery from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as retailers are restocking their inventory levels.\nFragrances segment profit in the year ended December 31, 2021 was $72.3 million, a $5.7 million, or 8.6%, increase, compared to $66.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $0.8 million favorable FX impact, Fragrances segment profit in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $4.9 million, or 7.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was driven primarily by the Fragrances segment's higher net sales, as described above, partially offset by the segment's higher brand support and other SG&A expenses primarily due to the increase in sales activity.\nREVLON, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCOMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\nGeographic Results:\nThe following tables provide a comparative summary of the Company's North America and International net sales for the periods presented:\n\n(a) XFX excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\nRevlon Segment\nNorth America\nIn North America, Revlon segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $8.4 million, or 2.2%, to $389.4 million, compared to $381.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $2.3 million favorable FX impact, Revlon segment net sales in North America in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $6.1 million, or 1.6%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The Revlon segment's $6.1 million XFX increase in North America net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to the Revlon segment's higher net sales of Revlon color cosmetics, which year-to-date positive performance was driven by the increase in sales experienced during the year ended December 31, 2021, as disclosed elsewhere above, partially offset by lower net sales of Revlon ColorSilk hair color products and Revlon-branded hair-care products.\nInternational\nInternationally, Revlon segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $31.1 million, or 10.1%, to $338.5 million, compared to $307.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $11.6 million favorable FX impact, Revlon segment International net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $19.5 million, or 6.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The Revlon segment's $19.5 million XFX increase in International net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven primarily by the Revlon segment's higher net sales of Revlon-branded professional hair-care products and of Revlon ColorSilk hair color products, primarily in the EMEA region. This increase was partially offset primarily by lower net sales of Revlon color cosmetics attributable to the negative year-to-date effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on this item in this region.\nElizabeth Arden Segment\nNorth America\nIn North America, Elizabeth Arden segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $5.4 million, or 5.2%, to $109.8 million, compared to $104.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.

This increase was due, primarily, to signs of improvements from the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on foot traffic at department stores and other retail outlets, and it was partially offset by lower net sales of Prevage.\nInternational\nInternationally, Elizabeth Arden segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $63.4 million, or 17.7%, to $422.5 million, compared to $359.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $17.8 million favorable FX impact, Elizabeth Arden segment International net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $45.6 million, or 12.7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The Elizabeth Arden segment's $45.6 million XFX increase in International net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven primarily by higher net sales of Green Tea fragrance, Ceramide skin care products and White Tea fragrances, as well as, to a lesser extent, other Elizabeth Arden-branded fragrances and skin care products. This increase was due, primarily, to growth in e-commerce net sales, as well as an increase in the travel retail business, while there are also signs of improvements from the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on foot traffic at department stores and other retail outlets, and it was partially offset by lower net sales of Prevage.\nPortfolio Segment\nNorth America\nIn North America, Portfolio segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $26.1 million, or 10.5%, to $274.0 million, as compared to $247.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $1.1 million favorable FX impact, Portfolio segment net sales in North America in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $25.0 million, or 10.1%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The Portfolio segment's $25.0 million XFX increase in North America net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven primarily by the Portfolio segment's higher net sales of American Crew men's grooming products, CND nail products and Almay color cosmetics, primarily in connection with retail channels continuing to show signs of improvement from the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This increase was partially offset by lower net sales of certain local and regional skin care products brands and, to a lower extent, of Mitchum anti-perspirant deodorants.\nInternational\nInternationally, Portfolio segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased by $8.3 million, or 5.4%, to $145.1 million, compared to $153.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $5.0 million favorable FX impact, Portfolio segment International net sales decreased by $13.3 million, or 8.7%, in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The Portfolio segment's $13.3 million XFX decrease in International net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven primarily by the Portfolio segment's lower net sales of previously sold brands and of certain local and regional skin care products brands. This decrease was partially offset primarily by higher net sales of Mitchum anti-perspirant deodorants and American Crew men's grooming products, primarily in connection with retail channels starting to show signs of improvement from the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nFragrances Segment\nNorth America\nIn North America, Fragrances segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $29.5 million, or 11.6%, to $282.9 million, as compared to $253.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $0.5 million favorable FX impact, Fragrances segment net sales in North America increased by $29.0 million, or 11.4%, in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The Fragrances segment's $29.0 million XFX increase in North America net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven primarily by higher net sales of Juicy Couture, John Varvatos and Britney Spears fragrances, as well as other certain licensed fragrance brands, partially offset by lower net sales of other distributed fragrances. This increase is primarily due to a recovery from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as retailers are restocking their inventory levels.\nREVLON, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCOMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\nInternational\nInternationally, Fragrances segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $18.8 million, or 19.2%, to $116.5 million, compared to $97.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $4.4 million favorable FX impact, Fragrances segment International net sales increased by $14.4 million, or 14.7%, in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The Fragrances segment's $14.4 million XFX increase in International net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven primarily by higher net sales of Juicy Couture, Britney Spears and John Varvatos fragrances, as well as, to a lower extent, of other certain licensed fragrance brands, primarily due to a recovery from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as retailers are restocking their inventory levels.\nGross profit:\nThe table below shows the Company's gross profit and gross margin for the periods presented:\n\nGross profit increased by $185.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended of 2020. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales (i.e., gross margin) in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by 4.4 percentage points, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in gross margin in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, was impacted primarily by favorable foreign currency impacts, lower manufacturing costs attributable to the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic compared to the prior year period, lower sales returns and favorable product mix, partially offset by lower favorable inventory adjustment in the year ended December 31, 2021.\nSG&A expenses:\nThe table below shows the Company's SG&A expenses for the periods presented:\n\nSG&A expenses increased by $27.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, driven primarily by:\n\u2022higher brand support expenses of approximately $51 million, resulting from the resumption of activities to sustain the higher level of net sales across all segments, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, when brand support expense had been reduced in response to the early periods of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022unfavorable FX impact of approximately $21 million; and\n\u2022higher distribution expenses of approximately $7 million, driven primarily by the increase in net sales\nwith the foregoing partially offset by:\n\u2022lower general and administrative expenses of approximately $42 million, primarily driven by cost reductions achieved through the Company's initiatives designed to mitigate the adverse impact of the ongoing and prolonged COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's operations, as well as the Revlon 2020 Restructuring Program.\nREVLON, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCOMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\nAcquisition, integration and divestiture costs:\nThe table below shows the Company's acquisition, integration and divestiture costs for the periods presented:\n\nThe Company incurred $2.3 million of divestiture costs in the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily relating to the amortization of the cash-based awards under Tier 1 and Tier 2 of the Revlon 2019 TIP (the \"2019 TIP\"). (See Note 12, \"Stock Compensation Plan,\" to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional details).\nThe Company incurred $5.0 million of divestiture costs in the year ended December 31, 2020 including approximately $4.2 million relating to the amortization of the cash-based awards under Tier 1 and Tier 2 of the Revlon 2019 TIP and $0.7 million in professional fees incurred in connection with the exploration of strategic transactions involving Revlon and third parties.\nRestructuring charges and other, net:\nThe table below shows the Company's restructuring charges and other, net for the periods presented:\n\nRestructuring charges and other, net, decreased $23.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to lower expenditures under RGGA during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the expenditures incurred primarily under the Revlon 2020 Restructuring Program during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nRevlon Global Growth Accelerator Program\nOn May 10, 2021, the Company announced that it is expanding the existing Revlon 2020 Restructuring Program through 2023. The Company renamed the revised program the Revlon Global Growth Accelerator ( RGGA\u201d). RGGA includes a reinvestment strategy to strengthen our brands and drive long-term profitable margin and revenue growth through realized incremental productivity initiatives and enhanced capabilities.\nThe major initiatives underlying the RGGA program include:\n\u2022Strategic Growth: Boost organic sales growth behind our strategic pillars - brands, markets, and channels -- to deliver an approximate mid-single digit compound average annual growth rate through 2023;\n\u2022Operating Efficiencies: Drive additional operational efficiencies and cost savings to fuel investments in revenue growth; and\n\u2022Build Capabilities: Enhance capabilities and up-skill employees in order to evolve our culture to promote agility and deliver transformational change.\nUnder RGGA, the Company expects to deliver an updated range of annualized cost reductions of approximately $275 million to $325 million from 2020 through the end of 2023. Approximately 50% of these annualized cost reductions were realized from the headcount reductions that occurred in 2020. The remaining cost reductions will be realized through reductions in SG&A expenses and cost of goods sold. The Company achieved $57 million of cost reductions during the year ended December 31, 2021, bringing the total cost reductions realized since the inception of the program to approximately $184 million, with the balance to be realized during 2022 and 2023.\nIn connection with implementing RGGA, the Company expects to recognize an updated cost range of approximately $185 million and $205 million of total pre-tax restructuring and related charges, consisting of employee-related costs, such as\nREVLON, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCOMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\nseverance, pension and other termination costs, as well as related third party expenses. The Company also expects to incur approximately $15 million of additional capital expenditures. Under the RGGA program, the Company incurred pre-tax restructuring and related charges of approximately $33.1 million during 2021, $101.9 million cumulative to date, and expects to incur the remainder during 2022 and 2023. The Company expects that substantially all of these restructuring and related charges will be paid in cash, with $95.3 million of the total cumulative charges paid as of December 31, 2021, with the remainder to be paid during 2022 and 2023.\nIn connection with RGGA, during the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded $33.1 million of total pre-tax restructuring and related charges consisting primarily of (i) $26.1 million of employee severance, other personnel benefits and other costs; and (ii) $7.0 million of lease and other restructuring-related charges that were recorded within SG&A and cost of sales. Since its inception and through December 31, 2021, the Company recorded $101.9 million of total pre-tax restructuring and related charges consisting primarily of (i) $76.6 million of employee severance, other personnel benefits and other costs; and (ii) $25.3 million of lease and other restructuring-related charges that were recorded within SG&A and cost of sales.\nSince its inception in March 2020 and through December 31, 2021, approximately 960 positions have been eliminated worldwide under RGGA.\nOn March 2, 2022, the Company announced that it is extending and expanding its existing Revlon Global Growth Accelerator ( RGGA\u201d) program through 2024. The extension and expansion will allow the", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and related notes and the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements\u201d this 2021 Form 10-K. As discussed in more detail in the Section entitled Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d this discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nWhile the Company continues to execute its business strategy, the ongoing and prolonged COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted net sales in all major commercial regions around the globe that are important to the Company's business. The COVID-19 pandemic's adverse impact on the global economy has contributed to significant and extended quarantines and other social distancing measures; the increased prevalence of remote working arrangements for employees in certain industries; disruptions in the global supply chain for a number of industries, including consumer retail, and related consumer products shortages and price increases for consumer products; closures, bankruptcies and/or reduced operations of retailers, beauty salons, spas, offices and manufacturing facilities; labor shortages with employers in many industries, including consumer retail, experiencing increased competition to recruit, hire and retain employees; travel and transportation restrictions leading to declines in consumer traffic in key shopping and tourist areas around the globe; and import and export restrictions. These adverse conditions have resulted in the general slowdown of the global economy, in turn contributing to declines in net sales within some of the Company's reporting segments and regions. However, with the roll out of COVID-19 vaccinations in the United States in 2021 and the easing of COVID-19 restrictions in 2021, the Company is seeing a resumption in consumer spending and consumption. The Company continues to closely monitor the impacts of COVID-19 including the impacts of any new variants of COVID-19 and subsequent waves\u201d of the pandemic, and will take appropriate actions in an effort to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic's negative effects on the Company's operations and financial results. See \"COVID-19 Impact on the Company's Business\" below for more details.\nLiquidity and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nEach reporting period, the Company assesses its ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date the financial statements are issued. At December 31, 2021, the Company had a liquidity position of $171.5 million, consisting of: (i) $102.4 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents (with approximately $97.2 million held outside the U.S.); (ii) $72.4 million in available borrowing capacity under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility (which had $289.6 million drawn at such date); and less (iii) approximately $3.3 million of outstanding checks. Under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, as Products Corporation's consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (\"FCCR\") was greater than 1.0 to 1.0 as of December 31, 2021, all of the approximately $72.4 million of availability under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility was available as of such date. The Company's evaluation includes its ability to meet its future contractual obligations and other conditions and events that may impact its liquidity.\nThe Company continues to focus on cost reduction and risk mitigation actions to address both the ongoing and prolonged impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as other risks in the business environment. It expects to generate additional liquidity through continued actions related to the RGGA program and other cost control initiatives as well as funds provided by selling certain assets or other strategic transactions in connection with the Company's ongoing Strategic Review. If sales continue to decline, the Company's cost control initiatives may include reductions in discretionary spend and reductions in investments in capital and permanent displays. Management believes that its recent debt refinancing activities, along with existing cash and cash equivalents and cost control initiatives provides the Company with sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations and maintain business operations for the next twelve months.\nHowever, there can be no assurance that available funds will be sufficient to meet the Company's cash requirements on a consolidated basis, as, among other things, the Company's liquidity can be impacted by a number of factors, including its level of sales, costs and expenditures, as well as accounts receivable and inventory, which serve as the principal variables impacting the amount of liquidity available under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility. For example, subject to certain exceptions, revolving loans under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and term loans under the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility must be prepaid to the extent that outstanding loans exceed the applicable borrowing base, consisting of certain accounts receivable, inventory and real estate.\nREVLON, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCOMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\nOverview\nOverview of the Business\nRevlon, Inc. (\"Revlon\" and together with its subsidiaries, the \"Company\") conducts its business exclusively through its direct wholly-owned operating subsidiary, Revlon Consumer Products Corporation (\"Products Corporation\"), and its subsidiaries. Revlon is an indirect majority-owned subsidiary of MacAndrews & Forbes Incorporated (together with certain of its affiliates other than the Company, \"MacAndrews & Forbes\"), a corporation beneficially owned by Ronald O. Perelman.\nThe Company operates in four brand-centric reporting segments that are aligned with its organizational structure based on four global brand teams: Revlon; Elizabeth Arden; Portfolio; and Fragrances. The Company manufactures, markets and sells an extensive array of beauty and personal care products worldwide, including color cosmetics; fragrances; skin care; hair color, hair care and hair treatments; beauty tools; men's grooming products; anti-perspirant deodorants; and other beauty care products.\nBusiness Strategy\nThe Company remains focused on its 3 key strategic pillars to drive its future success and growth. First, strengthening its iconic brands through innovation and relevant product portfolios; second, building its capabilities to better communicate and connect with its consumers through media channels where they spend the most time; and third, ensuring availability of its products where consumers shop, both in-store and increasingly online. The Company has continued to deliver against the objectives of the Revlon 2020 Restructuring Program (subsequently renamed during 2021 the Revlon Global Growth Accelerator, RGGA\u201d, as herein after defined), which includes rightsizing our organization with the objectives of driving improved profitability, cash flow and liquidity. The Company is also managing the business to conserve cash and liquidity, as well as continuing to focus on stabilizing the business, growing e-commerce and preparing the foundation for achieving future growth.\nStrategic Review\nMacAndrews & Forbes and the Company continue to explore strategic transactions involving the Company and third parties. This review is ongoing and remains focused on exploring potential options for the Company's portfolio and regional brands (the Strategic Review\u201d).\nCOVID-19 Impact on the Company's Business\nWhile the Company continues to execute its business strategy, the ongoing and prolonged COVID-19 pandemic has periodically adversely impacted net sales in all major commercial regions around the globe that are important to the Company's business. COVID-19 has contributed to significant and extended quarantines, stay-at-home orders and other social distancing measures; global supply chain disruptions, including manufacturing and transportation delays, due to closures, employee absences, port congestion, labor and container shortages, and shipment delays, increased transportation costs, tight labor markets and inflationary pressures, closures and bankruptcies of retailers, beauty salons, spas, offices and manufacturing facilities; increased levels of unemployment; travel and transportation restrictions leading to declines in consumer traffic in key shopping and tourist areas around the globe; and import and export restrictions. As the Company currently expects that the COVID-19 pandemic will periodically continue to impact its business going forward, the Company will continue to closely monitor the associated impacts and take appropriate actions in an effort to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic's negative effects on the Company's operations and financial results.\nFor additional information regarding the Company's business, see \"Part 1, Item 1 - Business\" in the Company's 2021 Form 10-K.\nOverview of Net Sales and Earnings Results\nConsolidated net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 were $2,078.7 million, a $174.4 million increase, or 9.2%, compared to $1,904.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $44.7 million favorable FX impact, consolidated net sales increased by $129.7 million, or 6.8%, during the year ended December 31, 2021. The XFX net sales increase of $129.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 was due to: a $49.0 million, or 10.6%, increase in Elizabeth Arden segment net sales; a $43.4 million, or 12.4%, increase in Fragrances segment net sales; a $25.6 million, or 3.7%, increase in Revlon segment net sales; and a $11.7 million or 2.9%, increase in Portfolio segment net sales.\nREVLON, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCOMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\nConsolidated loss from continuing operations, net of taxes, in the year ended December 31, 2021 was $206.9 million, compared to consolidated loss from continuing operations, net of taxes, of $619.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The $412.1 million decrease in consolidated loss from continuing operations, net of taxes, in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to year ended December 31, 2020, was primarily due to:\n\u2022$185.8 million of higher gross profit, primarily due to the higher net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 on net sales during the prior year period;\n\u2022a $152.6 million decrease in the provision for income taxes in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to: the establishment of a valuation allowance on net federal deferred tax assets in the prior year;\n\u2022a $144.1 million decrease in impairment charges attributable to the non-cash impairment charges of $111.0 million and of $33.1 million recorded on the Company's goodwill and on certain of the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets, respectively, following the Company's interim impairment assessments during the year ended December 31, 2020, all of which are primarily attributable to the effects of COVID-19, compared to having no impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2021;\n\u2022a $23.6 million decrease in restructuring charges, primarily related to lower expenditures under RGGA in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the expenditures incurred primarily under the Revlon 2020 Restructuring program (subsequently renamed RGGA) in the year ended December 31, 2020;\n\u2022a $6.9 million net decrease in other miscellaneous expenses, net, in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to financing fees expensed in 2020 in connection with the 2020 BrandCo Refinancing Transactions;\n\u2022a $2.7 million decrease in acquisition, integration and divestiture costs in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by the amortization of the cash-based awards under Tier 1 and Tier 2 of the Revlon 2019 TIP (see Note 12, \"Stock Compensation Plan,\" to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional details on the 2019 TIP); and\n\u2022$0.6 million of higher gain on divested assets primarily related to the sale of certain assets in the year ended December 31, 2021, consisting of the Company's Gatineau brand;\nwith the foregoing partially offset by:\n\u2022$27.3 million of higher SG&A expenses in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by the increased level of activity compared to the prior year, as the Company shows signs of rebound from the negative effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022a $43.1 million decrease in gain on the early extinguishment of debt from the repurchase and cancellation of approximately $157.2 million in aggregate principal face amount of Products Corporation's 5.75% Senior Notes during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to having no gain during the year ended December 31, 2021;\n\u2022$16.6 million of unfavorable variance in foreign currency, resulting from $10.6 million in foreign currency losses during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $6.0 million in foreign currency gains during the year ended December 31, 2020;\n\u2022a $12.8 million increase in amortization of debt issuance costs in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the additional debt issuance costs recorded and amortized in connection with the 2021 and 2020 Refinancing Transactions; and\n\u2022a $4.4 million increase in interest expense in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to higher weighted average interest rates driven primarily by the 2020 BrandCo Term Loan Facility.\nREVLON, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCOMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\nOperating Segments\nThe Company operates in four reporting segments: Revlon; Elizabeth Arden; Portfolio; and Fragrances:\n\u2022Revlon - The Revlon segment is comprised of the Company's flagship Revlon brands.

Excluding the $44.7 million favorable FX impact, consolidated net sales increased by $129.7 million, or 6.8%, during the year ended December 31, 2021. The XFX net sales increase of $129.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 was due to: a $49.0 million, or 10.6%, increase in Elizabeth Arden segment net sales; a $43.4 million, or 12.4%, increase in Fragrances segment net sales; a $25.6 million, or 3.7%, increase in Revlon segment net sales; and a $11.7 million or 2.9%, increase in Portfolio segment net sales.\nSegment Results:\nThe Company's management evaluates segment profit for each of the Company's reportable segments. The Company allocates corporate expenses to each reportable segment to arrive at segment profit, as these expenses are included in the internal measure of segment operating performance. The Company defines segment profit as income from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, gains/losses on foreign currency fluctuations, gains/losses on the early extinguishment of debt and miscellaneous expenses. Segment profit also excludes the impact of certain items that are not directly attributable to the segments' underlying operating performance. The Company does not have any material inter-segment sales. For a reconciliation of segment profit to loss from continuing operations before income taxes, see Note 16, \"Segment Data and Related Information,\" to the Company's Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nThe following table provide a comparative summary of the Company's segment results for the periods presented.\n \nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Segment\nRevlon segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 were $727.9 million, a $39.5 million, or 5.7%, increase, compared to $688.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $13.9 million favorable FX impact, total Revlon segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $25.6 million, or 3.7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The Revlon segment's XFX increase in net sales of $25.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven primarily by higher net sales of Revlon-branded professional hair care products in International regions, and higher net sales of Revlon color cosmetics, primarily in North America. This increase was due, primarily, to retail channels continuing to show signs of improvement from the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as well as salons' increased activity in connection with progressive and/or temporary lifting of restrictions related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by decreased net sales in North America of Revlon ColorSilk and Revlon-branded hair-care products.\nRevlon segment profit in the year ended December 31, 2021 was $86.8 million, a $0.3 million, or 0.3%, increase, compared to $86.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $3.2 million favorable FX impact, Revlon segment profit in the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased by $2.9 million, or 3.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was driven primarily by the Revlon segment's higher brand support and other SG&A expenses, partially offset by higher net sales and slightly higher gross profit margin.\nREVLON, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCOMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\nElizabeth Arden Segment\nElizabeth Arden segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 were $532.3 million, a $68.8 million, or 14.8%, increase, compared to $463.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $19.8 million favorable FX impact, Elizabeth Arden segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $49.0 million, or 10.6%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The Elizabeth Arden segment XFX increase in net sales of $49.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven primarily by higher net sales of Green Tea fragrances, primarily in International regions, and Ceramide skin care products, both in International regions and in North America, and, to a lower extent, higher net sales of White Tea fragrances, as well as other Elizabeth Arden-branded fragrances and skin care products, primarily in International regions. This increase was due, primarily, to growth in e-commerce net sales, as well as an increase in the travel retail business, while there are also signs of improvements from the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on foot traffic at department stores and other retail outlets, and it was partially offset by lower net sales of Prevage.\nElizabeth Arden segment profit in the year ended December 31, 2021 was $62.8 million, a $23.2 million, or 58.6%, increase, compared to $39.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $4.1 million favorable FX impact, Elizabeth Arden segment profit in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $19.1 million, or 48.2%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was driven primarily by the Elizabeth Arden segment's higher net sales and higher gross profit margin, partially offset by higher brand support and other SG&A expenses to support the increase in sales activity.\nPortfolio Segment\nPortfolio segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 were $419.1 million, a $17.8 million, or 4.4%, increase, compared to $401.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $6.1 million favorable FX impact, total Portfolio segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $11.7 million, or 2.9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The Portfolio segment XFX increase in net sales of $11.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven primarily by higher net sales of American Crew men's grooming products, and also by higher net sales in North America of CND nail products and Almay color cosmetics, partially offset by lower net sales of previously sold brands and of certain local and regional skin care products brands, primarily in International regions. The increase was primarily in connection with retail channels continuing to show signs of improvement from the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nPortfolio segment profit in the year ended December 31, 2021 was $71.0 million, a $23.6 million, or 49.8%, increase compared to $47.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $1.3 million favorable FX impact, Portfolio segment profit in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $22.3 million, or 47.0%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was driven primarily by the Portfolio segment's higher net sales and higher gross profit margin, as well as lower SG&A, achieved primarily through RGGA, partially offset by higher brand support expenses to support the increase in sales activity.\nFragrances Segment\nFragrances segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 were $399.4 million, a $48.3 million, or 13.8%, increase, compared to $351.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $4.9 million favorable FX impact, total Fragrances segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $43.4 million, or 12.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The Fragrances segment XFX increase in net sales of $43.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven primarily by higher net sales of Juicy Couture, John Varvatos, Britney Spears and Curve fragrances, partially offset by lower net sales of other distributed fragrances, primarily in North America, primarily due to a recovery from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as retailers are restocking their inventory levels.\nFragrances segment profit in the year ended December 31, 2021 was $72.3 million, a $5.7 million, or 8.6%, increase, compared to $66.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $0.8 million favorable FX impact, Fragrances segment profit in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $4.9 million, or 7.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was driven primarily by the Fragrances segment's higher net sales, as described above, partially offset by the segment's higher brand support and other SG&A expenses primarily due to the increase in sales activity.\nREVLON, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCOMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions, except

the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $8.4 million, or 2.2%, to $389.4 million, compared to $381.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $2.3 million favorable FX impact, Revlon segment net sales in North America in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $6.1 million, or 1.6%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The Revlon segment's $6.1 million XFX increase in North America net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to the Revlon segment's higher net sales of Revlon color cosmetics, which year-to-date positive performance was driven by the increase in sales experienced during the year ended December 31, 2021, as disclosed elsewhere above, partially offset by lower net sales of Revlon ColorSilk hair color products and Revlon-branded hair-care products.\nInternational\nInternationally, Revlon segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $31.1 million, or 10.1%, to $338.5 million, compared to $307.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $11.6 million favorable FX impact, Revlon segment International net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $19.5 million, or 6.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The Revlon segment's $19.5 million XFX increase in International net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven primarily by the Revlon segment's higher net sales of Revlon-branded professional hair-care products and of Revlon ColorSilk hair color products, primarily in the EMEA region. This increase was partially offset primarily by lower net sales of Revlon color cosmetics attributable to the negative year-to-date effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on this item in this region.\nElizabeth Arden Segment\nNorth America\nIn North America, Elizabeth Arden segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $5.4 million, or 5.2%, to $109.8 million, compared to $104.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.

This increase was due, primarily, to signs of improvements from the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on foot traffic at department stores and other retail outlets, and it was partially offset by lower net sales of Prevage.\nInternational\nInternationally, Elizabeth Arden segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $63.4 million, or 17.7%, to $422.5 million, compared to $359.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.

The Elizabeth Arden segment's $45.6 million XFX increase in International net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven primarily by higher net sales of Green Tea fragrance, Ceramide skin care products and White Tea fragrances, as well as, to a lesser extent, other Elizabeth Arden-branded fragrances and skin care products. This increase was due, primarily, to growth in e-commerce net sales, as well as an increase in the travel retail business, while there are also signs of improvements from the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on foot traffic at department stores and other retail outlets, and it was partially offset by lower net sales of Prevage.\nPortfolio Segment\nNorth America\nIn North America, Portfolio segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $26.1 million, or 10.5%, to $274.0 million, as compared to $247.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $1.1 million favorable FX impact, Portfolio segment net sales in North America in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $25.0 million, or 10.1%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The Portfolio segment's $25.0 million XFX increase in North America net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven primarily by the Portfolio segment's higher net sales of American Crew men's grooming products, CND nail products and Almay color cosmetics, primarily in connection with retail channels continuing to show signs of improvement from the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This increase was partially offset by lower net sales of certain local and regional skin care products brands and, to a lower extent, of Mitchum anti-perspirant deodorants.\nInternational\nInternationally, Portfolio segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased by $8.3 million, or 5.4%, to $145.1 million, compared to $153.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the $5.0 million favorable FX impact, Portfolio segment International net sales decreased by $13.3 million, or 8.7%, in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The Portfolio segment's $13.3 million XFX decrease in International net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven primarily by the Portfolio segment's lower net sales of previously sold brands and of certain local and regional skin care products brands. This decrease was partially offset primarily by higher net sales of Mitchum anti-perspirant deodorants and American Crew men's grooming products, primarily in connection with retail channels starting to show signs of improvement from the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nFragrances Segment\nNorth America\nIn North America, Fragrances segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $29.5 million, or 11.6%, to $282.9 million, as compared to $253.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.

The Fragrances segment's $29.0 million XFX increase in North America net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven primarily by higher net sales of Juicy Couture, John Varvatos and Britney Spears fragrances, as well as other certain licensed fragrance brands, partially offset by lower net sales of other distributed fragrances. This increase is primarily due to a recovery from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as retailers are restocking their inventory levels.\nREVLON, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCOMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\nInternational\nInternationally, Fragrances segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $18.8 million, or 19.2%, to $116.5 million, compared to $97.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.

RGGA includes a reinvestment strategy to strengthen our brands and drive long-term profitable margin and revenue growth through realized incremental productivity initiatives and enhanced capabilities.\nThe major initiatives underlying the RGGA program include:\n\u2022Strategic Growth: Boost organic sales growth behind our strategic pillars - brands, markets, and channels -- to deliver an approximate mid-single digit compound average annual growth rate through 2023;\n\u2022Operating Efficiencies: Drive additional operational efficiencies and cost savings to fuel investments in revenue growth; and\n\u2022Build Capabilities: Enhance capabilities and up-skill employees in order to evolve our culture to promote agility and deliver transformational change.\nUnder RGGA, the Company expects to deliver an updated range of annualized cost reductions of approximately $275 million to $325 million from 2020 through the end of 2023. Approximately 50% of these annualized cost reductions were realized from the headcount reductions that occurred in 2020. The remaining cost reductions will be realized through reductions in SG&A expenses and cost of goods sold. The Company achieved $57 million of cost reductions during the year ended December 31, 2021, bringing the total cost reductions realized since the inception of the program to approximately $184 million, with the balance to be realized during 2022 and 2023.\nIn connection with implementing RGGA, the Company expects to recognize an updated cost range of approximately $185 million and $205 million of total pre-tax restructuring and related charges, consisting of employee-related costs, such as\nREVLON, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCOMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\nseverance, pension and other termination costs, as well as related third party expenses.
