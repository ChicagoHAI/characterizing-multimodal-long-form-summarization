Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are an internally managed and self-advised REIT engaged in the ownership and operation primarily of office buildings throughout the United States. We were formed in 1986 under Maryland law. On November 10, 2016, we converted to what is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership real estate investment trust, or UPREIT, structure. Substantially all of the Company's assets and liabilities are now held in an Operating Trust through which the Company conducts its business.\nAt December 31, 2016, our portfolio included 33 properties (64 buildings), one land parcel and one property taken out of service which is now classified as a land parcel, with a combined 16.1 million square feet for a total investment of $2.9 billion at cost and a depreciated book value of $2.1 billion.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our overall portfolio was 91.1% leased. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we entered into leases for 4.3 million square feet, including lease renewals for 3.1 million square feet and new leases for 1.2 million square feet. Leases entered into during the year ended December 31, 2016, including both lease renewals and new leases, had weighted average cash rental rates that were approximately 0.2% lower than prior rental rates for the same space and weighted average GAAP rental rates that were approximately 12.1% higher than prior rental rates for the same space. The change in GAAP rents is different than the change in cash rents due to differences in the amount of rent abatements, the magnitude and timing of contractual rent increases over the lease term, and the years of term for the newly executed leases compared to the prior leases.\nThroughout 2016, our management team has continued to focus on executing our plan to reshape our portfolio in order to create long-term value for shareholders. In 2016, we continued to dispose of properties that do not meet our long-term goals. Specifically, we implemented the strategy adopted by our Board of Trustees in 2014 to dispose of assets that had one or more of the following attributes:\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>assets that did not offer an opportunity to create a competitive advantage;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>assets that were less than 150,000 square feet;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>assets that were not office buildings;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>assets that were not located in the U.S.; or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>assets that produced a low cash yield or required significant capital expenditures.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we disposed of 91 properties (135 buildings) and one land parcel with a combined 18.9 million square feet for an aggregate gross sales price of $2.0 billion, excluding closing costs. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold 30 properties (62 buildings) with a combined 8.0 million square feet for an aggregate gross sales price of $1.3 billion, excluding closing costs. In January 2017, we sold 111 Market Place (one building), with 589,380 square feet for $60.1 million, excluding closing costs. As a result of these dispositions, we now have exited 90 cities, 17 states and one country. We have generated significant proceeds from our dispositions to date and have a cash balance of $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2016. For more information regarding the 2016 and 2015 dispositions, see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe are now in the process of transitioning from primarily disposing of assets to a more holistic repositioning of our portfolio consistent with the office repositioning strategy adopted by our Board of Trustees in December of 2016. Our strategy is to own and acquire at a discount to replacement cost high-quality, multi-tenant office assets in markets and sub-markets with favorable long-term supply and demand fundamentals. Our efforts will primarily be focused on larger office buildings in central business districts and major urban areas that offer an attractive quality of life, including opportunities for tenants to live and play in close proximity to where they work, with a preference for markets that have above average limitations on new supply.\nWhile executing this strategy, depending on market conditions, we may sell additional properties and are seeking to acquire attractive properties in markets meeting the criteria above. We seek to reinvest the capital received from dispositions to purchase new properties, repay debt, buy back common shares or make other investments or distributions that further our long-term strategic goals and the repositioning strategy adopted by our Board of Trustees. However, we may not be able to make suitable acquisitions or other investments with the proceeds from the dispositions. In addition, as our real estate investments have decreased, our income from operations has also declined.\nAs part of the disposition plan noted above, and pursuant to our accounting policy, in 2016, we evaluated the recoverability of the carrying values of each of the real estate assets that comprised our portfolio and determined that due to the shortening of the expected periods of ownership as a result of the disposition plan and current estimates of market value, it was necessary to reduce the net book value of a portion of the real estate assets in our portfolio to their estimated fair values. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $58.5 million for year ended December 31, 2016 in accordance with our impairment analysis procedures.\nWe have engaged CBRE, Inc. (CBRE) to provide property management services for our properties. We pay CBRE a property-by-property management fee and may engage CBRE from time-to-time to perform project management services, such as coordinating and overseeing the completion of tenant improvements and other capital projects at the properties. We reimburse CBRE for certain expenses incurred in the performance of its duties, including certain personnel and equipment costs.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we incurred expenses of $25.8 million and $42.7 million, respectively, related to our property management agreement with CBRE, for property management fees, typically calculated as a portion of the properties revenues, and salary and benefits reimbursements for property personnel, such as property managers, engineers and maintenance staff. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had amounts payable pursuant to these services of $2.7 million and $3.5 million, respectively.\nProperty Operations\nOccupancy data for 2016 and 2015 are as follows (square feet in thousands):\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>All Properties(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Comparable Properties(2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total properties\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total square feet\n</td> <td>16,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent leased(2)\n</td> <td>91.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Excludes properties sold in the period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Based on properties owned continuously from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2016, and excludes properties sold during the period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Percent leased includes (i) space being fitted out for occupancy pursuant to existing leases and (ii) space which is leased but is not occupied or is being offered for sublease by tenants.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe weighted average lease term based on square feet for leases entered into during the year ended December 31, 2016 was 8.7 years. Commitments made for leasing expenditures and concessions, such as tenant improvements and leasing commissions, for leases entered into during the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $143.0 million, or $33.31 per square foot on average (approximately $3.88 per square foot per year of the lease term).\nAs of December 31, 2016, approximately 6.0% of our leased square feet and 6.3% of our annualized rental revenue, determined as set forth below, are included in leases scheduled to expire through December 31, 2017. Renewed and new leases and rental rates at which available space may be rented in the future will depend on prevailing market conditions at the times these leases are negotiated. We believe that the in-place cash rents for leases expiring in 2017 are slightly below market. Lease expirations by year, as of December 31, 2016, are as follows (square feet and dollars in thousands):\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

The interest rate cap, effective April 1, 2016, has a notional amount of $400.0 million and a maturity date of March 1, 2019.\nOn May 15, 2016, we redeemed all of our 11,000,000 outstanding series E preferred shares at a price of $25.00 per share, for a total of $275.0 million, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. The redemption payment occurred on May 16, 2016 (the first business day following the redemption date). We recorded $9.6 million related to the excess fair value of consideration paid over the carrying value of the preferred shares as a reduction to net income attributable to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOn November 10, 2016, we repaid at par $167.8 million of mortgage debt at 1735 Market Street and recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees and breakage costs. We also recognized $0.2 million of expense included in interest and other income related to an interest rate swap as a result of the early repayment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOn November 10, 2016, we converted to what is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership real estate investment trust, or UPREIT, structure. In connection with this conversion, the Company contributed substantially all of its assets to the Operating Trust, and the Operating Trust assumed substantially all of the Company's liabilities pursuant to a contribution and assignment agreement between the Company and the Operating Trust. The Company now conducts and intends to continue to conduct substantially all of its activities through the Operating Trust.\nIn connection with our conversion to an UPREIT structure, the Operating Trust entered into an amended and restated credit agreement, replacing the Company's prior credit agreement. Under the amended and restated credit agreement, the Operating Trust has assumed all obligations of the Company as borrower and the Company is released from such obligations. The amended and restated credit agreement was amended and restated primarily to facilitate changes necessary to complete convert to an UPREIT structure. The economic terms of the amended and restated credit agreement are substantially the same as the terms of the Company's prior credit agreement, providing for (i) a $750.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, (ii) a $200.0 million 5-year term loan facility and (iii) a $200.0 million 7-year term loan facility.\nOn December 15, 2016, we redeemed at par $250.0 million of our 6.25% senior unsecured notes due 2017 and recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $0.1 million from the write-off of an unamortized discount and unamortized deferred financing fees.\nFor more information regarding our financing sources and activities, please see the section captioned Liquidity and Capital Resources-Our Investment and Financing Liquidity and Resources\u201d below.\nRESULTS

We define NOI as income from our real estate including lease termination fees received from tenants less our property operating expenses. NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions. We consider NOI to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income because it may help both investors and management to understand the operations of our properties. We use NOI internally to evaluate property level performance, and we believe that NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level and may facilitate comparisons of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs. NOI does not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, net income attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders, operating income or cash flow from operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, or as an indicator of our financial performance or liquidity, nor is this measure necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs. This measure should be considered in conjunction with net income, net income attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders, operating income and cash flow from operating activities as presented in our consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statements of comprehensive income and consolidated statements of cash flows. Other REITs and real estate companies may calculate NOI differently than we do.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We refer to the 33 properties (64 buildings) we owned continuously from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2016, as comparable properties. We refer to the sold properties as other properties. Our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, include the operating results of 33 properties for the entire periods, as we owned these properties as of January 1, 2015.\nRental income. Rental income decreased $161.3 million, or 28.3%, in the 2016 period, compared to the 2015 period, primarily due to the properties sold in 2016 and 2015, partially offset by an increase of 3.4% in rental income at the comparable properties. The increase in rental income at the comparable properties is due to an increase in straight line rent adjustments related to new leasing activity where the tenants have not yet started paying rent, partially offset by several large tenant lease expirations and lease contractions. The increase in rental income at the comparable properties is also due to charges against revenue of $2.7 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015 related to a one-time parking tax matter and a tenant lease termination at 600 West Chicago Avenue in the 2015 period.\nRental income includes increases for straight line rent adjustments totaling $14.1 million in the 2016 period and $5.3 million in the 2015 period, and net reductions for amortization of acquired real estate leases and assumed real estate lease obligations totaling $6.5 million in the 2016 period and $7.5 million in the 2015 period. Rental income also includes the recognition of lease termination fees totaling $23.4 million in the 2016 period and $8.2 million in the 2015 period.\nTenant reimbursements and other income. Tenant reimbursements and other income decreased $52.9 million, or 36.6% in the 2016 period, compared to the 2015 period primarily due to the properties sold in 2016 and 2015. Tenant reimbursements and other income decreased $4.3 million, or 5.4%, at our comparable properties primarily due to a decrease in utility reimbursements as a result of the milder winter in 2016, a decrease in real estate tax reimbursements and a bankruptcy settlement received in the prior year.\nOperating expenses. The $124.2 million, or 38.2%, decrease in operating expenses during the 2016 period as compared to the 2015 period is primarily due to the properties sold in 2016 and 2015. Operating expenses at our comparable properties decreased $0.6 million, or 0.4%, primarily due to a decrease in utility expense as a result of the milder winter in 2016, a decrease in real estate tax expense and a decrease in bad debt expense, partially offset by increases in maintenance and repairs.\nDepreciation and amortization. The decrease of $62.2 million, or 32.1%, in depreciation and amortization expense in the 2016 period when compared to the 2015 period primarily relates to properties sold in 2016 and 2015.\nGeneral and administrative. The decrease of $7.2 million, or 12.5% in general and administrative expenses primarily relates to a $7.9 million decrease related to the shareholder approved reimbursement of expenses incurred by Related/Corvex in connection with their consent solicitation to remove our former Trustees, a decrease of $2.7 million of expenses related to the termination and cooperation agreement with our former manager, and a $1.8 million decrease in litigation costs, partially offset by an increase of $2.9 million for share-based compensation expense, and $1.7 million of severance and related expenses in the 2016 period as a result of staffing reductions.\nLoss on asset impairment. The increase of $41.3 million in loss on asset impairment is due to additional charges that we incurred in the 2016 as compared to the 2015 period. We recorded impairment charges of $43.7 million in the second quarter of 2016 related to 111 Monument Circle, 101-115 W. Washington Street and 100 East Wisconsin Avenue, and $14.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 related to Parkshore Plaza, Cabot Business Park Land, 625 Crane Street and 111 Market Place based upon the shortening of our expected periods of ownership as a result of our disposition plan and updated market information in accordance with our impairment analysis procedures. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded impairment charges of $17.2 million related to 12655 Olive Boulevard, 1285 Fern Ridge Parkway and portfolios of properties located in Georgia and New York, based upon updated market information in accordance with our impairment analysis procedures.\nOperating income. The decrease of $61.9 million, or 51.0%, in operating income is primarily due to lower net operating income as a result of our smaller size portfolio of assets and an increase in the loss on asset impairment. These decreases in operating income were partially offset by a lease termination fee of $18.0 million received at 111 Monument Circle in the 2016 period and lower depreciation expense as a result of our smaller size portfolio of assets.\nInterest and other income. The increase of $4.3 million of interest and other income in the 2016 period primarily reflects interest received on higher cash balances in the current year. Interest and other income in the 2015 period primarily reflects a $3.1 million gain on the sale of securities in the first quarter of 2015.\nInterest expense. The decrease of $23.0 million, or 21.4%, in interest expense primarily reflects the prepayment of $138.8 million of our 5.75% senior unsecured notes in May 2015, the foreclosure of the $40.1 million mortgage debt balance secured by 225 Water Street in May 2015, the defeasance of the outstanding $141.4 million balance of the mortgage debt secured by 111 East Wacker Drive, one of the buildings included in the Illinois Center disposition, in August 2015, the repayment of the $116.0 mortgage debt at 111 Monument Circle in December 2015, the prepayment of $139.1 million of our 6.25% senior unsecured notes in February 2016, the repayment of the $167.8 million mortgage debt at 1735 Market Street in November 2016, the prepayment of $250.0 million of our 6.25% senior unsecured notes in December 2016, and a decrease in amortization of deferred financing fees, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of net mortgage debt premiums and an increase in interest expense related to our term loans as a result of an increase in interest rates.\n(Loss) gain on early extinguishment of debt. We had a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $2.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $6.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The loss on early extinguishment in the 2016 period reflects the write-off of an unamortized discount and unamortized deferred financing fees related to our redemption of $139.1 million of our 6.25% senior unsecured notes due 2016 and $250.0\nmillion of our 6.25% senior unsecured notes due 2017 and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees and breakage costs incurred related to our repayment of the mortgage debt at 1735 Market Street. The gain on early extinguishment of debt in the 2015 period reflects a $17.3 million gain related to the 225 Water Street foreclosure and a $0.6 million gain related to the repayment of mortgage debt at 111 Monument Circle, partially offset by a $6.2 million loss related to the defeasance of the mortgage loan secured by 1320 Main Street, a $3.9 million loss related to the defeasance of the mortgage loan secured by 111 East Wacker Drive, one of the buildings included in the Illinois Center disposition, a $0.6 million loss related to the prepayment of mortgage debt at 2501 20th Place South, a $0.1 million loss related to the redemption of $138.8 million of our 5.75% senior unsecured notes due 2015 and a $0.4 million loss related to the termination of our prior credit agreement.\nForeign currency exchange loss. The foreign currency exchange loss for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 relates to the translation of proceeds from the sale of the Australian portfolio that were held in an Australian bank account.\nGain on sale of properties, net. Gain on sale of properties, net increased $166.5 million in the 2016 period as compared to the 2015 period due to a $16.5 million gain on the sale of Executive Park, a $5.5 million gain on the sale of 3330 N Washington Boulevard, a $14.7 million gain on the sale of 111 East Kilbourn Avenue, a $9.0 million gain on the sale of 1525 Locust Street, a $16.0 million gain on the sale of 633 Ahua Street, a $13.6 million gain on the sale of Lakewood on the Park, a $15.9 million gain on the sale of leased land, a $20.6 million gain on the sale of the downtown Austin portfolio, a $30.6 million gain on the sale of the movie theater portfolio and a $0.6 million gain on the sale of 9110 East Nichols Avenue in the first and second quarters of 2016. In the third quarter of 2016 we recorded gains of $78.2 million, $4.7 million, $8.4 million, and $7.2 million related to the sales of 111 River Street, Sky Park Centre, 8701 N Mopac and the South Carolina industrial portfolio, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2016 we recorded gains of $14.9 million, $3.1 million and $7.7 million related to the sales of 7800 Shoal Creek Boulevard, 1200 Lakeside Drive and 6200 Glenn Carlson Drive, respectively. These gains were partially offset by losses in the third quarter of 2016 of $0.7 million and $15.8 million related to the sales of Raintree Industrial Park and the Midwest portfolio, respectively.\nIn the first quarter of 2015, we sold two properties and recorded a $5.9 million gain on sale of properties. In the second quarter of 2015, we recorded gains of $41.6 million and $11.9 million related to the sales of an office portfolio in AL, LA, NC, SC and Sorrento Valley Business Park, respectively. In the third quarter of 2015, we recorded gains of $27.0 million, $17.6 million and $7.9 million related to the sales of Illinois Center, 185 Asylum Street and 16th and Race Street, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded gains of $22.8 million, $9.5 million, $8.4 million and $4.3 million related to the sales of Arizona Center, One Park Square, 4 South 84th Avenue and One South Church Avenue, respectively.\nThese gains were partially offset by a loss in the second quarter on the sale of properties in Australia of $47.9 million, which is net of the write off of approximately $63.2 million of foreign currency translation adjustments previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. We also recognized losses in the second quarter of $8.2 million and $2.3 million related to sales of a portfolio of small office and industrial properties and two properties in St. Louis, respectively, a loss in the third quarter of $12.5 million related to the sale of a portfolio in upstate New York and losses in the fourth quarter of $3.1 million and $0.4 million related to the sale of a portfolio in Georgia and the sale of 775 Ridge Lake Boulevard, respectively.\nIncome tax expense. The $1.6 million decrease in income tax expense primarily relates to a decrease in foreign tax expense due to the sale of the Australian assets in 2015 and federal income tax expense incurred in 2015 as a result of a taxable built-in gain triggered by the sale of a property that was previously owned by a C corporation. The decrease in income tax expense was partially offset by an increase in state income tax expense due to the sale of properties in certain states.\nPreferred distributions. The $10.0 million decrease in preferred distributions relates to the redemption of all of our 11,000,000 outstanding series E preferred shares on May 15, 2016.\nExcess fair value of consideration paid over carrying value of preferred shares. On May 15, 2016, we redeemed all of our 11,000,000 outstanding series E preferred shares at a price of $25.00 per share and recorded $9.6 million related to the excess fair value of consideration paid over the carrying value of the preferred shares as a reduction to net income attributable to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear Ended December 31,

from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2015, as comparable properties. We refer to the sold properties as other properties. Our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 include the operating results of 65 properties for the entire periods, as we owned these properties as of January 1, 2014.\nRental income. Rental income decreased $121.3 million in the 2015 period, compared to the 2014 period, primarily due to the properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2015. Our rental income from comparable properties increased $1.2 million primarily due to an increase in the recognition of lease termination fees and increases due to the write offs in 2014 of an acquired real estate lease after a tenant vacated its space prior to the lease expiration and of a deferred rent receivable after a tenant contracted its lease space. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in rental income due to leasing activity in 2015 at a particular\nbuilding where one tenant vacated its space and two tenants shortened their remaining lease terms. In connection with these leasing transactions, the corresponding deferred rent receivable balances were written off or amortized over the shorter term. The increase in rental income was also partially offset by charges against revenues of $2.7 million related to a parking tax matter and a tenant lease termination at 600 West Chicago Avenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nRental income includes increases for straight line rent adjustments totaling $5.3 million in the 2015 period and $12.5 million in the 2014 period, and net reductions for amortization of acquired real estate leases and assumed real estate lease obligations totaling $7.5 million in the 2015 period and $10.6 million in the 2014 period. Rental income also includes the recognition of lease termination fees totaling $8.2 million in the 2015 period and $4.7 million in the 2014 period.\nTenant reimbursements and other income. Tenant reimbursements and other income decreased $25.6 million in the 2015 period, compared to the 2014 period primarily due to the properties sold in 2015 and a $1.3 million decrease at our comparable properties primarily resulting from non-recurring prior year utility expense reimbursement.\nOperating expenses. The $63.0 million decrease in operating expenses during the 2015 period as compared to the 2014 period is primarily due to the properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2015, partially offset by a $0.8 million increase at our comparable properties. The increase in operating expenses at the comparable properties primarily reflects increases in real estate tax expense related to increases in assessed values, bad debt expense primarily due to an evicted tenant, property related legal fees, maintenance and repairs, HVAC expenses and cleaning expenses, partially offset by decreases in management fees and increases in real estate tax refunds in 2015 related to prior year real estate taxes.\nDepreciation and amortization. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in the 2015 period when compared to the 2014 period primarily relates to properties sold in 2015. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the leasing transactions discussed above, where due to one tenant vacating its space and two other tenants shortening their remaining lease term, the corresponding tenant improvements were written off or depreciation was accelerated.\nGeneral and administrative. The decrease in general and administrative expenses primarily relates to $43.9 million of business management and incentive fees paid to our prior external manager in 2014, a $14.5 million decrease related to the shareholder approved reimbursement of expenses incurred by Related/Corvex in connection with their consent solicitation to remove our former Trustees, and a $9.4 million decrease in legal and litigation costs, partially offset by the internalization of our management, which includes a $9.5 million increase in share-based compensation expense.\nLoss on asset impairment. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded an impairment charge of $17.2 million related to 12655 Olive Boulevard, 1285 Fern Ridge Parkway and portfolios of properties located in Georgia and New York, based upon updated market information in accordance with our impairment analysis procedures. The impairment charge in 2014 includes $22.7 million related to 225 Water Street where we made the decision to cease making loan servicing payments and impairment losses recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014 as a result of the change in the anticipated holding period for certain properties.\nInterest and other income. The increase in interest and other income primarily relates to a $3.1 million gain on the sale of securities in the first quarter of 2015 and an increase in bank interest income due to a higher average cash balance during the 2015 period as compared to the 2014 period.\nInterest expense. The decrease in interest expense in the 2015 period primarily reflects the payment of the $235.0 million balance on our revolving credit facility in July 2014, the prepayment of $265.0 million of 5.68% mortgage debt in August 2014, the prepayment of $33.4 million of our 6.40% unsecured notes in September 2014, the prepayment of $125.0 million of our 7.50% unsecured notes in November 2014 the payment of $100.0 million of our term loan in December 2014, the prepayment of $138.8 million of our 5.75% senior unsecured notes due 2015 in May 2015, the foreclosure of 225 Water Street in May 2015 and the defeasance of the outstanding balance of the mortgage debt secured by 111 East Wacker Drive, one of the buildings included in Illinois Center, in August 2015.\nGain on early extinguishment of debt. The gain on early extinguishment of debt in the 2015 period reflects a $17.3 million gain related to the 225 Water Street foreclosure and a $0.6 million gain related to the repayment of mortgage debt at 111 Monument Circle, partially offset by a $6.2 million loss related to the defeasance of the mortgage loan secured by 1320 Main Street, a $3.9 million loss related to the defeasance of the mortgage loan secured by 111 East Wacker Drive, a $0.6 million loss related to the prepayment of mortgage debt at 2501 20th Place South, a $0.1 million loss related to the redemption of $138.8 million of our 5.75% senior notes and a $0.4 million loss related to the new credit agreement entered into in January 2015, which resulted in the termination of our prior credit agreement. The gain on early extinguishment of debt in the 2014 period primarily reflects the write-\noff of unamortized premiums and deferred financing fees related to the prepayment of $265.0 million of 5.68% mortgage debt at 600 West Chicago Avenue in August 2014, partially offset by the write off of deferred financing fees related to the prepayment of $125.0 million of our 7.50% unsecured senior notes due 2019.\nGain on sale of equity investments. The gain on sale of equity investments in the 2014 period reflects the sale on July 9, 2014 of our entire stake of 22,000,000 common shares of SIR at a per share sales price in excess of our per share carrying value, partially offset by a loss on the sale of our investment in AIC in May 2014.\nGain on issuance of shares by an equity investee. The gain on issuance of shares by an equity investee primarily reflects the issuance of 10,000,000 common shares by SIR during the second quarter of 2014 at prices above our per share carrying value.\nForeign currency exchange loss. The foreign currency exchange loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 relates to the change in foreign currency rates resulting in losses on cash proceeds from the Australian portfolio disposition maintained in an Australian bank account prior to the transfer of cash from our Australian subsidiary to our U.S bank accounts.\nGain on sale of properties, net. In the first quarter of 2015, we sold two properties and recorded a $5.9 million gain on sale of properties. In the second quarter of 2015, we recorded gains of $41.6 million and $11.9 million related to the sales of an office portfolio in AL, LA, NC, SC and Sorrento Valley Business Park, respectively. In the third quarter of 2015, we recorded gains of $27.0 million, $17.6 million and $7.9 million related to the sales of Illinois Center, 185 Asylum Street and 16th and Race Street, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded gains of $22.8 million, $9.5 million, $8.4 million and $4.3 million related to the sales of Arizona Center, One Park Square, 4 South 84th Avenue and One South Church Avenue, respectively.\nThese gains were partially offset by a loss in the second quarter on the sale of properties in Australia of $47.9 million, which is net of the write off of approximately $63.2 million of foreign currency translation adjustments previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. We also recognized losses in the second quarter of $8.2 million and $2.3 million related to sales of a portfolio of small office and industrial properties and two properties in St. Louis, respectively a loss in the third quarter of $12.5 million related to the sale of a portfolio in upstate New York and losses in the fourth quarter of $3.1 million and $0.4 million related to the sale of a portfolio in Georgia and the sale of 775 Ridge Lake Boulevard, respectively.\nIncome tax expense. The decrease in income tax expense relates to a decrease in foreign tax expense related to the Australian assets, which were sold in June 2015. The decrease in the foreign tax expense was partially offset by federal income tax expense in the second quarter of 2015 incurred as a result of a taxable built-in gain triggered by the sale of a property that was previously owned by a C corporation.\nEquity in earnings of investees. Equity in earnings of investees represents our proportionate share of earnings from SIR during the 2014 period prior to the sale of our entire stake of 22,000,000 common shares of SIR on July 9, 2014 and our proportionate share of earnings from AIC during the 2014 period prior to the sale of our investment in AIC on May 9, 2014.\nIncome from discontinued operations. In 2015, we adopted ASU 2014-08 and did not classify the properties sold in 2015 as discontinued operations in accordance with this guidance. Income from discontinued operations in the 2014 period relates to 14 properties (43 buildings) sold in 2014.\nLoss on asset impairment from discontinued operations. The 2014 loss on asset impairment reflects the write down to estimated fair value less costs to sell for 14 properties (43 buildings) sold during 2014.\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt from discontinued operations. The 2014 loss on early extinguishment of debt reflects prepayment premiums and the write off of unamortized discounts and deferred financing fees associated with the repayment of $11.2 million of 6.14% mortgage debt and $8.5 million of 5.78% mortgage debt in June 2014.\nPreferred distributions. The decrease in preferred distributions reflects the conversion of 10,264,503 of our series D preferred shares into 10,412,499 of our common shares during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nExcess fair value of consideration over carrying value of preferred shares. As a result of the conversion of our series D preferred shares in May 2014, we recorded a preferred distribution of $16.2 million for the excess of the market value of the common shares issued above the carrying value of the series D preferred shares converted.\nInflation\nInflation in the past several years in the United States has been modest. Future inflation might have either positive or negative impacts on our business. Inflation might cause the value of our real estate to increase. Inflation might also cause our costs of equity and debt capital and operating costs to increase. An increase in our capital costs or in our operating costs may result in decreased earnings unless it is offset by increased revenues. Further inflation may permit us to increase rents upon renewal or enter new leases above the previous rent amounts for the leased space.\nTo mitigate the adverse impact of any increased cost of debt capital in the event of material inflation, we may enter into additional interest rate hedge arrangements in the future. The decision to enter into these agreements will be based on various factors, including the amount of our floating rate debt outstanding, our belief that material interest rate increases are likely to occur, the costs of and our expected benefit from these agreements and upon requirements of our borrowing arrangements.\nIn periods of rapid inflation, our tenants' operating costs may increase faster than revenues, which may have an adverse impact upon us if our tenants' operating income becomes insufficient to pay our rent. To mitigate the adverse impact of tenant financial distress upon us, we require many of our tenants to provide guarantees or security for our rent.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur Operating Liquidity and Resources\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $2.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents. We expect to use our cash balances, cash flow from our operations and proceeds of future property sales to fund our operations, repay debt, make distributions, purchase our common shares, acquire assets, fund tenant improvements and leasing costs and for other general business purposes. We believe our cash balances and the cash flow from our operations will be sufficient to fund our ordinary course activities.\nOur future cash flows from operating activities will depend primarily upon our:\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>ability to maintain or improve the occupancy of, and the rental rates at, our properties;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>ability to control operating and financing cost increases at our properties; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>ability to purchase additional properties which produce rents, less property operating expenses, in excess of our costs of acquisition capital and which are consistent with our office repositioning strategy.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nVolatility in energy costs and real estate taxes may cause our future operating costs to fluctuate; however, the impact of these fluctuations is expected to be partially offset by the pass through of operating costs to our tenants pursuant to lease terms, although there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully offset these costs or that doing so would not negatively impact our competitive position or business.\nCash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities were $163.0 million, $1,052.1 million and $(923.2) million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016, and $181.5 million, $1,648.9 million and $(382.7) million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015. Changes in these three categories of our cash flows between 2016 and 2015 are primarily related to real estate improvements, our dispositions of properties, our purchase of our common shares, our repayments of debt, and our redemption of our preferred shares.\nOur Investment and Financing Liquidity and Resources\nIn order to maintain financial flexibility, to fund acquisitions and to meet cash needs that may result from timing differences between our receipt of rents and our desire or need to make distributions and investments or pay operating or capital expenses, we maintain an unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of institutional lenders. Our credit agreement provides us with (i) a $750.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, (ii) a $200.0 million 5-year term loan facility and (iii) a $200.0 million 7-year term loan facility. The revolving credit facility has a scheduled maturity date of January 28, 2019, which maturity date may be extended for up to two additional periods of six months at our option subject to satisfaction of certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee of 0.075% of the aggregate amount available under the revolving credit facility. The 5-year term loan and the 7-year term loan have scheduled maturity dates of January 28, 2020 and January 28, 2022, respectively.\nBorrowings under our revolving credit facility currently bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread, which was 125 basis points as of December 31, 2016. We also pay a facility fee of 25 basis points per annum on the total amount of lending commitments under our revolving credit facility. Both the interest rate spread and the facility fee are subject to adjustment based upon changes to our credit ratings. We are allowed to borrow, repay and reborrow funds available under our revolving credit facility until maturity, and no principal repayment is due until maturity. As of December 31, 2016, the interest rate payable on borrowings under our revolving credit facility was 2.02%. As of December 31, 2016, we had no balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility.\nOur term loans currently bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a spread, which was 140 and 180 basis points for the 5-year and 7-year term loan, respectively, as of December 31, 2016. The interest rate spread is subject to adjustment based upon changes to our credit ratings. As of December 31, 2016, the interest rate for the amounts outstanding under our term loan was 2.17% and 2.57% for the 5-year and 7-year term loan, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, our 5-year and 7-year term loans each had outstanding balances of $200.0 million.\nOn February 16, 2016, we redeemed at par $139.1 million of our 6.25% senior unsecured notes due 2016. On November 10, 2016, we repaid at par $167.8 million of mortgage debt at 1735 Market Street. On December 15, 2016, we redeemed at par $250.0 million of our 6.25% senior unsecured notes due 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we paid an aggregate of $18.0 million of distributions on our series D and series E preferred shares. On May 15, 2016, we redeemed all of our 11,000,000 outstanding series E preferred shares at a price of $25.00 per share, for a total of $275.0 million, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. The redemption payment occurred on May 16, 2016 (the first business day following the redemption date). On January 12, 2017, we announced that our Board of Trustees declared a dividend of $0.40625 per series D preferred share, which was paid on February 15, 2017 to shareholders of record on January 30, 2017.\nOn March 17, 2016, our Board of Trustees authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $150.0 million of our outstanding common shares over the twelve month period following the date of authorization. This is in addition to the $200.0 million previously authorized by our Board of Trustees in 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we purchased and retired 2,491,675 of our common shares at a weighted average price of $27.68 per share for a total investment of $69.0 million. Since the inception of the common share repurchase plan through December 31, 2016, we have purchased and retired a total of 5,901,975 of our common shares at a weighted average price of $26.57 per share, for a total of $156.8 million. In August and September 2016, the first two share repurchase authorizations, of which $86.6 million was not utilized, expired. The $106.6 million of remaining authorization available under our share repurchase program as of December 31, 2016 is scheduled to expire in March 2017.\nOur outstanding debt maturities and weighted average interest rates as of December 31, 2016, were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Scheduled Principal Payments During Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year\n</td> <td>Unsecured Floating Rate Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Unsecured Fixed Rate Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Secured Fixed Rate Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average Interest Rate(2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>251,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020\n</td> <td>200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>451,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,982\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,982\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022\n</td> <td>200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2023\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2024\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2025\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2026\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>400,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>675,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,151,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Total debt outstanding as of December 31, 2016, including net unamortized premiums and discounts and net unamortized deferred financing costs, equals $1,141,667.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Weighted based on current contractual interest rates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>The 5.75% senior unsecured notes due 2042 are callable at par on or after August 1, 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor further information about our indebtedness, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nWhen significant amounts are outstanding under our revolving credit facility, or as the maturity dates of our revolving credit facility and term debts approach, we explore alternatives to repay amounts due. Such alternatives may include incurring additional debt and issuing new equity securities, extending the maturity of our revolving credit facility and entering into a new revolving credit facility. We have an effective shelf registration statement that allows us to issue public securities on an expedited basis, but it does not assure that there will be buyers for such securities.\nWe believe that we will have access to various types of financings, including debt or equity offerings, to fund our future acquisitions and to pay our debts and other obligations as they become due. The completion and the costs of our future debt transactions will depend primarily upon market conditions and our credit ratings. We have no control over market conditions. Our credit ratings depend upon evaluations by credit rating agencies of our business practices and plans and, in particular, whether we appear to have the ability to maintain our earnings, to space our debt maturities and to balance our use of debt and equity capital so that our financial performance and leverage ratios afford us flexibility to withstand any reasonably foreseeable adverse changes. We intend to conduct our business activities in a manner which will continue to afford us reasonable access to capital for investment and financing activities. However, there can be no assurance regarding our credit ratings or our ability to complete any debt or equity offerings or that our cost of any future public or private financings will not increase.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold 30 properties (62 buildings) with a combined 8.0 million square feet for an aggregate sales price of $1.3 billion, excluding closing costs. In January 2017, we sold 111 Market Place (one building), with 589,380 square feet for $60.1 million, excluding closing costs. For more information regarding these transactions, see Notes 3 and 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which are incorporated herein by reference.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 amounts capitalized at our properties, including properties sold and properties classified in discontinued operations, for tenant improvements, leasing costs, building improvements were as follows (amounts in thousands):\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant improvements(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing costs(2)\n</td> <td>34,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Building improvements(3)\n</td> <td>29,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Tenant improvements include capital expenditures to improve tenants' space.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Leasing costs primarily include brokerage commissions and legal expenses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Building improvements generally include expenditures to replace obsolete building components and expenditures that extend the useful life of existing assets.

Our public debt indenture and related supplements and our credit agreement contain a number of financial ratio covenants which generally restrict our ability to incur debts, in excess of calculated amounts, restrict our ability to make distributions under certain circumstances and require us to maintain other financial ratios. At December 31, 2016, we believe we were in compliance with all covenants under both our indenture and related supplements and under our credit agreement. In addition to our unsecured debt obligations, we had $77.7 million (including net unamortized premiums and net unamortized deferred financing costs) of mortgage notes outstanding at December 31, 2016.\nNone of our indenture and related supplements, our credit agreement, or our mortgage notes contain provisions for acceleration or require us to provide collateral security which could be triggered by our debt ratings. However, our senior debt rating is used to determine the interest rate and the fees payable under our credit agreement.\nOFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or that we expect would be reasonably likely to have a future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are an internally managed and self-advised REIT engaged in the ownership and operation primarily of office buildings throughout the United States. We were formed in 1986 under Maryland law. On November 10, 2016, we converted to what is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership real estate investment trust, or UPREIT, structure. Substantially all of the Company's assets and liabilities are now held in an Operating Trust through which the Company conducts its business.\nAt December 31, 2016, our portfolio included 33 properties (64 buildings), one land parcel and one property taken out of service which is now classified as a land parcel, with a combined 16.1 million square feet for a total investment of $2.9 billion at cost and a depreciated book value of $2.1 billion.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our overall portfolio was 91.1% leased. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we entered into leases for 4.3 million square feet, including lease renewals for 3.1 million square feet and new leases for 1.2 million square feet. Leases entered into during the year ended December 31, 2016, including both lease renewals and new leases, had weighted average cash rental rates that were approximately 0.2% lower than prior rental rates for the same space and weighted average GAAP rental rates that were approximately 12.1% higher than prior rental rates for the same space. The change in GAAP rents is different than the change in cash rents due to differences in the amount of rent abatements, the magnitude and timing of contractual rent increases over the lease term, and the years of term for the newly executed leases compared to the prior leases.\nThroughout 2016, our management team has continued to focus on executing our plan to reshape our portfolio in order to create long-term value for shareholders. In 2016, we continued to dispose of properties that do not meet our long-term goals. Specifically, we implemented the strategy adopted by our Board of Trustees in 2014 to dispose of assets that had one or more of the following attributes:\n \u2022 assets that did not offer an opportunity to create a competitive advantage; \n \u2022 assets that were less than 150,000 square feet; \n \u2022 assets that were not office buildings; \n \u2022 assets that were not located in the U.S.; or \n \u2022 assets that produced a low cash yield or required significant capital expenditures. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we disposed of 91 properties (135 buildings) and one land parcel with a combined 18.9 million square feet for an aggregate gross sales price of $2.0 billion, excluding closing costs. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold 30 properties (62 buildings) with a combined 8.0 million square feet for an aggregate gross sales price of $1.3 billion, excluding closing costs. In January 2017, we sold 111 Market Place (one building), with 589,380 square feet for $60.1 million, excluding closing costs. As a result of these dispositions, we now have exited 90 cities, 17 states and one country. We have generated significant proceeds from our dispositions to date and have a cash balance of $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2016. For more information regarding the 2016 and 2015 dispositions, see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe are now in the process of transitioning from primarily disposing of assets to a more holistic repositioning of our portfolio consistent with the office repositioning strategy adopted by our Board of Trustees in December of 2016. Our strategy is to own and acquire at a discount to replacement cost high-quality, multi-tenant office assets in markets and sub-markets with favorable long-term supply and demand fundamentals. Our efforts will primarily be focused on larger office buildings in central business districts and major urban areas that offer an attractive quality of life, including opportunities for tenants to live and play in close proximity to where they work, with a preference for markets that have above average limitations on new supply.\nWhile executing this strategy, depending on market conditions, we may sell additional properties and are seeking to acquire attractive properties in markets meeting the criteria above. We seek to reinvest the capital received from dispositions to purchase new properties, repay debt, buy back common shares or make other investments or distributions that further our long-term strategic goals and the repositioning strategy adopted by our Board of Trustees. However, we may not be able to make suitable acquisitions or other investments with the proceeds from the dispositions. In addition, as our real estate investments have decreased, our income from operations has also declined.\nAs part of the disposition plan noted above, and pursuant to our accounting policy, in 2016, we evaluated the recoverability of the carrying values of each of the real estate assets that comprised our portfolio and determined that due to the shortening of the expected periods of ownership as a result of the disposition plan and current estimates of market value, it was necessary to reduce the net book value of a portion of the real estate assets in our portfolio to their estimated fair values. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $58.5 million for year ended December 31, 2016 in accordance with our impairment analysis procedures.\nWe have engaged CBRE, Inc. (CBRE) to provide property management services for our properties. We pay CBRE a property-by-property management fee and may engage CBRE from time-to-time to perform project management services, such as coordinating and overseeing the completion of tenant improvements and other capital projects at the properties. We reimburse CBRE for certain expenses incurred in the performance of its duties, including certain personnel and equipment costs.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we incurred expenses of $25.8 million and $42.7 million, respectively, related to our property management agreement with CBRE, for property management fees, typically calculated as a portion of the properties revenues, and salary and benefits reimbursements for property personnel, such as property managers, engineers and maintenance staff. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had amounts payable pursuant to these services of $2.7 million and $3.5 million, respectively.\nProperty Operations\nOccupancy data for 2016 and 2015 are as follows (square feet in thousands):\n\n (1) Excludes properties sold in the period. \n (2) Based on properties owned continuously from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2016, and excludes properties sold during the period. \n (3) Percent leased includes (i) space being fitted out for occupancy pursuant to existing leases and (ii) space which is leased but is not occupied or is being offered for sublease by tenants. \nThe weighted average lease term based on square feet for leases entered into during the year ended December 31, 2016 was 8.7 years. Commitments made for leasing expenditures and concessions, such as tenant improvements and leasing commissions, for leases entered into during the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $143.0 million, or $33.31 per square foot on average (approximately $3.88 per square foot per year of the lease term).\nAs of December 31, 2016, approximately 6.0% of our leased square feet and 6.3% of our annualized rental revenue, determined as set forth below, are included in leases scheduled to expire through December 31, 2017. Renewed and new leases and rental rates at which available space may be rented in the future will depend on prevailing market conditions at the times these leases are negotiated. We believe that the in-place cash rents for leases expiring in 2017 are slightly below market. Lease expirations by year, as of December 31, 2016, are as follows (square feet and dollars in thousands):\n\n (1) Square feet is pursuant to existing leases as of December 31, 2016, and includes (i) space being fitted out for occupancy and (ii) space which is leased but is not occupied or is being offered for sublease by tenants. \n (2) Annualized rental revenue is annualized contractual rents from our tenants pursuant to leases which have commenced as of December 31, 2016, plus estimated recurring expense reimbursements; includes triple net lease rents and excludes lease value amortization, straight line rent adjustments, abated (\"free\") rent periods and parking revenue. We calculate annualized rental revenue by aggregating the recurring billings outlined above for the most recent month during the quarter reported, adding abated rent, and multiplying the sum by 12 to provide an estimation of near-term potentially-recurring revenues. Annualized rental revenue is a forward-looking non-GAAP measure. Annualized rental revenue cannot be reconciled to a comparable GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts, primarily due to the fact that it is calculated from the billings of tenants in the most recent month at the most recent rental rates during the quarter reported, whereas historical GAAP measures include billings from a potentially different group of tenants over multiple months at potentially different rental rates. \nA principal source of funds for our operations is rents from tenants at our properties. Rents are generally received from our tenants monthly in advance, except from our government tenants, who usually pay rents monthly in arrears. As of December 31, 2016, tenants representing 1.5% or more of our total annualized rental revenue were as follows (square feet in thousands):\n\n (1) Square footage is pursuant to existing leases as of December 31, 2016, and includes (i) space being fitted out for occupancy and (ii) space which is leased but is not occupied or is being offered for sublease by tenants. \n (2) Annualized rental revenue is annualized contractual rents from our tenants pursuant to leases which have commenced as of December 31, 2016, plus estimated recurring expense reimbursements; includes triple net lease rents and excludes lease value amortization, straight line rent adjustments, abated (\"free\") rent periods and parking revenue. We calculate annualized rental revenue by aggregating the recurring billings outlined above for the most recent month during the quarter reported, adding abated rent, and multiplying the sum by 12 to provide an estimation of near-term potentially-recurring revenues. Annualized rental revenue is a forward-looking non-GAAP measure. Annualized rental revenue cannot be reconciled to a comparable GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts, primarily due to the fact that it is calculated from the billings of tenants in the most recent month at the most recent rental rates during the quarter reported, whereas historical GAAP measures include billings from a potentially different group of tenants over multiple months at potentially different rental rates. \n (3) Groupon, Inc. statistics include 207,536 square feet that are sublet from Bankers Life and Casualty Company. \n (4) Exelon Corporation is a tenant at 111 Market Place, which was sold on January 31, 2017. \nFinancing Activities\nOn February 16, 2016, we redeemed at par $139.1 million of our 6.25% senior unsecured notes due 2016 and recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $0.1 million from the write-off of an unamortized discount and unamortized deferred financing fees for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOn March 4, 2016, we purchased an interest rate cap with a LIBOR strike price of 2.50%. The interest rate cap, effective April 1, 2016, has a notional amount of $400.0 million and a maturity date of March 1, 2019.\nOn May 15, 2016, we redeemed all of our 11,000,000 outstanding series E preferred shares at a price of $25.00 per share, for a total of $275.0 million, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. The redemption payment occurred on May 16, 2016 (the first business day following the redemption date). We recorded $9.6 million related to the excess fair value of consideration paid over the carrying value of the preferred shares as a reduction to net income attributable to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOn November 10, 2016, we repaid at par $167.8 million of mortgage debt at 1735 Market Street and recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees and breakage costs. We also recognized $0.2 million of expense included in interest and other income related to an interest rate swap as a result of the early repayment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOn November 10, 2016, we converted to what is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership real estate investment trust, or UPREIT, structure. In connection with this conversion, the Company contributed substantially all of its assets to the Operating Trust, and the Operating Trust assumed substantially all of the Company's liabilities pursuant to a contribution and assignment agreement between the Company and the Operating Trust. The Company now conducts and intends to continue to conduct substantially all of its activities through the Operating Trust.\nIn connection with our conversion to an UPREIT structure, the Operating Trust entered into an amended and restated credit agreement, replacing the Company's prior credit agreement. Under the amended and restated credit agreement, the Operating Trust has assumed all obligations of the Company as borrower and the Company is released from such obligations. The amended and restated credit agreement was amended and restated primarily to facilitate changes necessary to complete convert to an UPREIT structure. The economic terms of the amended and restated credit agreement are substantially the same as the terms of the Company's prior credit agreement, providing for (i) a $750.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, (ii) a $200.0 million 5-year term loan facility and (iii) a $200.0 million 7-year term loan facility.\nOn December 15, 2016, we redeemed at par $250.0 million of our 6.25% senior unsecured notes due 2017 and recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $0.1 million from the write-off of an unamortized discount and unamortized deferred financing fees.\nFor more information regarding our financing sources and activities, please see the section captioned Liquidity and Capital Resources-Our Investment and Financing Liquidity and Resources\u201d below.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015 \n (1) Comparable properties consist of 33 properties (64 buildings) owned continuously from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2016. \n (2) Other properties consist of properties sold. \n (3) We calculate net operating income, or NOI, as shown above. We define NOI as income from our real estate including lease termination fees received from tenants less our property operating expenses. NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions. We consider NOI to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income because it may help both investors and management to understand the operations of our properties. We use NOI internally to evaluate property level performance, and we believe that NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level and may facilitate comparisons of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs. NOI does not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, net income attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders, operating income or cash flow from operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, or as an indicator of our financial performance or liquidity, nor is this measure necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs. This measure should be considered in conjunction with net income, net income attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders, operating income and cash flow from operating activities as presented in our consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statements of comprehensive income and consolidated statements of cash flows. Other REITs and real estate companies may calculate NOI differently than we do.  We refer to the 33 properties (64 buildings) we owned continuously from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2016, as comparable properties. We refer to the sold properties as other properties. Our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, include the operating results of 33 properties for the entire periods, as we owned these properties as of January 1, 2015.\nRental income. Rental income decreased $161.3 million, or 28.3%, in the 2016 period, compared to the 2015 period, primarily due to the properties sold in 2016 and 2015, partially offset by an increase of 3.4% in rental income at the comparable properties. The increase in rental income at the comparable properties is due to an increase in straight line rent adjustments related to new leasing activity where the tenants have not yet started paying rent, partially offset by several large tenant lease expirations and lease contractions. The increase in rental income at the comparable properties is also due to charges against revenue of $2.7 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015 related to a one-time parking tax matter and a tenant lease termination at 600 West Chicago Avenue in the 2015 period.\nRental income includes increases for straight line rent adjustments totaling $14.1 million in the 2016 period and $5.3 million in the 2015 period, and net reductions for amortization of acquired real estate leases and assumed real estate lease obligations totaling $6.5 million in the 2016 period and $7.5 million in the 2015 period. Rental income also includes the recognition of lease termination fees totaling $23.4 million in the 2016 period and $8.2 million in the 2015 period.\nTenant reimbursements and other income. Tenant reimbursements and other income decreased $52.9 million, or 36.6% in the 2016 period, compared to the 2015 period primarily due to the properties sold in 2016 and 2015. Tenant reimbursements and other income decreased $4.3 million, or 5.4%, at our comparable properties primarily due to a decrease in utility reimbursements as a result of the milder winter in 2016, a decrease in real estate tax reimbursements and a bankruptcy settlement received in the prior year.\nOperating expenses. The $124.2 million, or 38.2%, decrease in operating expenses during the 2016 period as compared to the 2015 period is primarily due to the properties sold in 2016 and 2015. Operating expenses at our comparable properties decreased $0.6 million, or 0.4%, primarily due to a decrease in utility expense as a result of the milder winter in 2016, a decrease in real estate tax expense and a decrease in bad debt expense, partially offset by increases in maintenance and repairs.\nDepreciation and amortization. The decrease of $62.2 million, or 32.1%, in depreciation and amortization expense in the 2016 period when compared to the 2015 period primarily relates to properties sold in 2016 and 2015.\nGeneral and administrative. The decrease of $7.2 million, or 12.5% in general and administrative expenses primarily relates to a $7.9 million decrease related to the shareholder approved reimbursement of expenses incurred by Related/Corvex in connection with their consent solicitation to remove our former Trustees, a decrease of $2.7 million of expenses related to the termination and cooperation agreement with our former manager, and a $1.8 million decrease in litigation costs, partially offset by an increase of $2.9 million for share-based compensation expense, and $1.7 million of severance and related expenses in the 2016 period as a result of staffing reductions.\nLoss on asset impairment. The increase of $41.3 million in loss on asset impairment is due to additional charges that we incurred in the 2016 as compared to the 2015 period. We recorded impairment charges of $43.7 million in the second quarter of 2016 related to 111 Monument Circle, 101-115 W. Washington Street and 100 East Wisconsin Avenue, and $14.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 related to Parkshore Plaza, Cabot Business Park Land, 625 Crane Street and 111 Market Place based upon the shortening of our expected periods of ownership as a result of our disposition plan and updated market information in accordance with our impairment analysis procedures. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded impairment charges of $17.2 million related to 12655 Olive Boulevard, 1285 Fern Ridge Parkway and portfolios of properties located in Georgia and New York, based upon updated market information in accordance with our impairment analysis procedures.\nOperating income. The decrease of $61.9 million, or 51.0%, in operating income is primarily due to lower net operating income as a result of our smaller size portfolio of assets and an increase in the loss on asset impairment. These decreases in operating income were partially offset by a lease termination fee of $18.0 million received at 111 Monument Circle in the 2016 period and lower depreciation expense as a result of our smaller size portfolio of assets.\nInterest and other income. The increase of $4.3 million of interest and other income in the 2016 period primarily reflects interest received on higher cash balances in the current year. Interest and other income in the 2015 period primarily reflects a $3.1 million gain on the sale of securities in the first quarter of 2015.\nInterest expense. The decrease of $23.0 million, or 21.4%, in interest expense primarily reflects the prepayment of $138.8 million of our 5.75% senior unsecured notes in May 2015, the foreclosure of the $40.1 million mortgage debt balance secured by 225 Water Street in May 2015, the defeasance of the outstanding $141.4 million balance of the mortgage debt secured by 111 East Wacker Drive, one of the buildings included in the Illinois Center disposition, in August 2015, the repayment of the $116.0 mortgage debt at 111 Monument Circle in December 2015, the prepayment of $139.1 million of our 6.25% senior unsecured notes in February 2016, the repayment of the $167.8 million mortgage debt at 1735 Market Street in November 2016, the prepayment of $250.0 million of our 6.25% senior unsecured notes in December 2016, and a decrease in amortization of deferred financing fees, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of net mortgage debt premiums and an increase in interest expense related to our term loans as a result of an increase in interest rates.\n(Loss) gain on early extinguishment of debt. We had a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $2.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $6.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The loss on early extinguishment in the 2016 period reflects the write-off of an unamortized discount and unamortized deferred financing fees related to our redemption of $139.1 million of our 6.25% senior unsecured notes due 2016 and $250.0\nmillion of our 6.25% senior unsecured notes due 2017 and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees and breakage costs incurred related to our repayment of the mortgage debt at 1735 Market Street. The gain on early extinguishment of debt in the 2015 period reflects a $17.3 million gain related to the 225 Water Street foreclosure and a $0.6 million gain related to the repayment of mortgage debt at 111 Monument Circle, partially offset by a $6.2 million loss related to the defeasance of the mortgage loan secured by 1320 Main Street, a $3.9 million loss related to the defeasance of the mortgage loan secured by 111 East Wacker Drive, one of the buildings included in the Illinois Center disposition, a $0.6 million loss related to the prepayment of mortgage debt at 2501 20th Place South, a $0.1 million loss related to the redemption of $138.8 million of our 5.75% senior unsecured notes due 2015 and a $0.4 million loss related to the termination of our prior credit agreement.\nForeign currency exchange loss. The foreign currency exchange loss for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 relates to the translation of proceeds from the sale of the Australian portfolio that were held in an Australian bank account.\nGain on sale of properties, net. Gain on sale of properties, net increased $166.5 million in the 2016 period as compared to the 2015 period due to a $16.5 million gain on the sale of Executive Park, a $5.5 million gain on the sale of 3330 N Washington Boulevard, a $14.7 million gain on the sale of 111 East Kilbourn Avenue, a $9.0 million gain on the sale of 1525 Locust Street, a $16.0 million gain on the sale of 633 Ahua Street, a $13.6 million gain on the sale of Lakewood on the Park, a $15.9 million gain on the sale of leased land, a $20.6 million gain on the sale of the downtown Austin portfolio, a $30.6 million gain on the sale of the movie theater portfolio and a $0.6 million gain on the sale of 9110 East Nichols Avenue in the first and second quarters of 2016. In the third quarter of 2016 we recorded gains of $78.2 million, $4.7 million, $8.4 million, and $7.2 million related to the sales of 111 River Street, Sky Park Centre, 8701 N Mopac and the South Carolina industrial portfolio, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2016 we recorded gains of $14.9 million, $3.1 million and $7.7 million related to the sales of 7800 Shoal Creek Boulevard, 1200 Lakeside Drive and 6200 Glenn Carlson Drive, respectively. These gains were partially offset by losses in the third quarter of 2016 of $0.7 million and $15.8 million related to the sales of Raintree Industrial Park and the Midwest portfolio, respectively.\nIn the first quarter of 2015, we sold two properties and recorded a $5.9 million gain on sale of properties. In the second quarter of 2015, we recorded gains of $41.6 million and $11.9 million related to the sales of an office portfolio in AL, LA, NC, SC and Sorrento Valley Business Park, respectively. In the third quarter of 2015, we recorded gains of $27.0 million, $17.6 million and $7.9 million related to the sales of Illinois Center, 185 Asylum Street and 16th and Race Street, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded gains of $22.8 million, $9.5 million, $8.4 million and $4.3 million related to the sales of Arizona Center, One Park Square, 4 South 84th Avenue and One South Church Avenue, respectively.\nThese gains were partially offset by a loss in the second quarter on the sale of properties in Australia of $47.9 million, which is net of the write off of approximately $63.2 million of foreign currency translation adjustments previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. We also recognized losses in the second quarter of $8.2 million and $2.3 million related to sales of a portfolio of small office and industrial properties and two properties in St. Louis, respectively, a loss in the third quarter of $12.5 million related to the sale of a portfolio in upstate New York and losses in the fourth quarter of $3.1 million and $0.4 million related to the sale of a portfolio in Georgia and the sale of 775 Ridge Lake Boulevard, respectively.\nIncome tax expense. The $1.6 million decrease in income tax expense primarily relates to a decrease in foreign tax expense due to the sale of the Australian assets in 2015 and federal income tax expense incurred in 2015 as a result of a taxable built-in gain triggered by the sale of a property that was previously owned by a C corporation. The decrease in income tax expense was partially offset by an increase in state income tax expense due to the sale of properties in certain states.\nPreferred distributions. The $10.0 million decrease in preferred distributions relates to the redemption of all of our 11,000,000 outstanding series E preferred shares on May 15, 2016.\nExcess fair value of consideration paid over carrying value of preferred shares. On May 15, 2016, we redeemed all of our 11,000,000 outstanding series E preferred shares at a price of $25.00 per share and recorded $9.6 million related to the excess fair value of consideration paid over the carrying value of the preferred shares as a reduction to net income attributable to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear Ended December 31, 2015, Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014 \nComparable properties consist of 65 properties (127 buildings) owned continuously from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2015.\n (1) Other properties consist of properties sold. \n (2) See Note 3 on page 33 for further information regarding NOI. \nWe refer to the 65 properties (127 buildings) we owned continuously from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2015, as comparable properties. We refer to the sold properties as other properties. Our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 include the operating results of 65 properties for the entire periods, as we owned these properties as of January 1, 2014.\nRental income. Rental income decreased $121.3 million in the 2015 period, compared to the 2014 period, primarily due to the properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2015. Our rental income from comparable properties increased $1.2 million primarily due to an increase in the recognition of lease termination fees and increases due to the write offs in 2014 of an acquired real estate lease after a tenant vacated its space prior to the lease expiration and of a deferred rent receivable after a tenant contracted its lease space. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in rental income due to leasing activity in 2015 at a particular\nbuilding where one tenant vacated its space and two tenants shortened their remaining lease terms. In connection with these leasing transactions, the corresponding deferred rent receivable balances were written off or amortized over the shorter term. The increase in rental income was also partially offset by charges against revenues of $2.7 million related to a parking tax matter and a tenant lease termination at 600 West Chicago Avenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nRental income includes increases for straight line rent adjustments totaling $5.3 million in the 2015 period and $12.5 million in the 2014 period, and net reductions for amortization of acquired real estate leases and assumed real estate lease obligations totaling $7.5 million in the 2015 period and $10.6 million in the 2014 period. Rental income also includes the recognition of lease termination fees totaling $8.2 million in the 2015 period and $4.7 million in the 2014 period.\nTenant reimbursements and other income. Tenant reimbursements and other income decreased $25.6 million in the 2015 period, compared to the 2014 period primarily due to the properties sold in 2015 and a $1.3 million decrease at our comparable properties primarily resulting from non-recurring prior year utility expense reimbursement.\nOperating expenses. The $63.0 million decrease in operating expenses during the 2015 period as compared to the 2014 period is primarily due to the properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2015, partially offset by a $0.8 million increase at our comparable properties. The increase in operating expenses at the comparable properties primarily reflects increases in real estate tax expense related to increases in assessed values, bad debt expense primarily due to an evicted tenant, property related legal fees, maintenance and repairs, HVAC expenses and cleaning expenses, partially offset by decreases in management fees and increases in real estate tax refunds in 2015 related to prior year real estate taxes.\nDepreciation and amortization. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in the 2015 period when compared to the 2014 period primarily relates to properties sold in 2015. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the leasing transactions discussed above, where due to one tenant vacating its space and two other tenants shortening their remaining lease term, the corresponding tenant improvements were written off or depreciation was accelerated.\nGeneral and administrative. The decrease in general and administrative expenses primarily relates to $43.9 million of business management and incentive fees paid to our prior external manager in 2014, a $14.5 million decrease related to the shareholder approved reimbursement of expenses incurred by Related/Corvex in connection with their consent solicitation to remove our former Trustees, and a $9.4 million decrease in legal and litigation costs, partially offset by the internalization of our management, which includes a $9.5 million increase in share-based compensation expense.\nLoss on asset impairment. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded an impairment charge of $17.2 million related to 12655 Olive Boulevard, 1285 Fern Ridge Parkway and portfolios of properties located in Georgia and New York, based upon updated market information in accordance with our impairment analysis procedures. The impairment charge in 2014 includes $22.7 million related to 225 Water Street where we made the decision to cease making loan servicing payments and impairment losses recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014 as a result of the change in the anticipated holding period for certain properties.\nInterest and other income. The increase in interest and other income primarily relates to a $3.1 million gain on the sale of securities in the first quarter of 2015 and an increase in bank interest income due to a higher average cash balance during the 2015 period as compared to the 2014 period.\nInterest expense. The decrease in interest expense in the 2015 period primarily reflects the payment of the $235.0 million balance on our revolving credit facility in July 2014, the prepayment of $265.0 million of 5.68% mortgage debt in August 2014, the prepayment of $33.4 million of our 6.40% unsecured notes in September 2014, the prepayment of $125.0 million of our 7.50% unsecured notes in November 2014 the payment of $100.0 million of our term loan in December 2014, the prepayment of $138.8 million of our 5.75% senior unsecured notes due 2015 in May 2015, the foreclosure of 225 Water Street in May 2015 and the defeasance of the outstanding balance of the mortgage debt secured by 111 East Wacker Drive, one of the buildings included in Illinois Center, in August 2015.\nGain on early extinguishment of debt. The gain on early extinguishment of debt in the 2015 period reflects a $17.3 million gain related to the 225 Water Street foreclosure and a $0.6 million gain related to the repayment of mortgage debt at 111 Monument Circle, partially offset by a $6.2 million loss related to the defeasance of the mortgage loan secured by 1320 Main Street, a $3.9 million loss related to the defeasance of the mortgage loan secured by 111 East Wacker Drive, a $0.6 million loss related to the prepayment of mortgage debt at 2501 20th Place South, a $0.1 million loss related to the redemption of $138.8 million of our 5.75% senior notes and a $0.4 million loss related to the new credit agreement entered into in January 2015, which resulted in the termination of our prior credit agreement. The gain on early extinguishment of debt in the 2014 period primarily reflects the write-\noff of unamortized premiums and deferred financing fees related to the prepayment of $265.0 million of 5.68% mortgage debt at 600 West Chicago Avenue in August 2014, partially offset by the write off of deferred financing fees related to the prepayment of $125.0 million of our 7.50% unsecured senior notes due 2019.\nGain on sale of equity investments. The gain on sale of equity investments in the 2014 period reflects the sale on July 9, 2014 of our entire stake of 22,000,000 common shares of SIR at a per share sales price in excess of our per share carrying value, partially offset by a loss on the sale of our investment in AIC in May 2014.\nGain on issuance of shares by an equity investee. The gain on issuance of shares by an equity investee primarily reflects the issuance of 10,000,000 common shares by SIR during the second quarter of 2014 at prices above our per share carrying value.\nForeign currency exchange loss. The foreign currency exchange loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 relates to the change in foreign currency rates resulting in losses on cash proceeds from the Australian portfolio disposition maintained in an Australian bank account prior to the transfer of cash from our Australian subsidiary to our U.S bank accounts.\nGain on sale of properties, net. In the first quarter of 2015, we sold two properties and recorded a $5.9 million gain on sale of properties. In the second quarter of 2015, we recorded gains of $41.6 million and $11.9 million related to the sales of an office portfolio in AL, LA, NC, SC and Sorrento Valley Business Park, respectively. In the third quarter of 2015, we recorded gains of $27.0 million, $17.6 million and $7.9 million related to the sales of Illinois Center, 185 Asylum Street and 16th and Race Street, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded gains of $22.8 million, $9.5 million, $8.4 million and $4.3 million related to the sales of Arizona Center, One Park Square, 4 South 84th Avenue and One South Church Avenue, respectively.\nThese gains were partially offset by a loss in the second quarter on the sale of properties in Australia of $47.9 million, which is net of the write off of approximately $63.2 million of foreign currency translation adjustments previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. We also recognized losses in the second quarter of $8.2 million and $2.3 million related to sales of a portfolio of small office and industrial properties and two properties in St. Louis, respectively a loss in the third quarter of $12.5 million related to the sale of a portfolio in upstate New York and losses in the fourth quarter of $3.1 million and $0.4 million related to the sale of a portfolio in Georgia and the sale of 775 Ridge Lake Boulevard, respectively.\nIncome tax expense. The decrease in income tax expense relates to a decrease in foreign tax expense related to the Australian assets, which were sold in June 2015. The decrease in the foreign tax expense was partially offset by federal income tax expense in the second quarter of 2015 incurred as a result of a taxable built-in gain triggered by the sale of a property that was previously owned by a C corporation.\nEquity in earnings of investees. Equity in earnings of investees represents our proportionate share of earnings from SIR during the 2014 period prior to the sale of our entire stake of 22,000,000 common shares of SIR on July 9, 2014 and our proportionate share of earnings from AIC during the 2014 period prior to the sale of our investment in AIC on May 9, 2014.\nIncome from discontinued operations. In 2015, we adopted ASU 2014-08 and did not classify the properties sold in 2015 as discontinued operations in accordance with this guidance. Income from discontinued operations in the 2014 period relates to 14 properties (43 buildings) sold in 2014.\nLoss on asset impairment from discontinued operations. The 2014 loss on asset impairment reflects the write down to estimated fair value less costs to sell for 14 properties (43 buildings) sold during 2014.\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt from discontinued operations. The 2014 loss on early extinguishment of debt reflects prepayment premiums and the write off of unamortized discounts and deferred financing fees associated with the repayment of $11.2 million of 6.14% mortgage debt and $8.5 million of 5.78% mortgage debt in June 2014.\nPreferred distributions. The decrease in preferred distributions reflects the conversion of 10,264,503 of our series D preferred shares into 10,412,499 of our common shares during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nExcess fair value of consideration over carrying value of preferred shares. As a result of the conversion of our series D preferred shares in May 2014, we recorded a preferred distribution of $16.2 million for the excess of the market value of the common shares issued above the carrying value of the series D preferred shares converted.\nInflation\nInflation in the past several years in the United States has been modest. Future inflation might have either positive or negative impacts on our business. Inflation might cause the value of our real estate to increase. Inflation might also cause our costs of equity and debt capital and operating costs to increase. An increase in our capital costs or in our operating costs may result in decreased earnings unless it is offset by increased revenues. Further inflation may permit us to increase rents upon renewal or enter new leases above the previous rent amounts for the leased space.\nTo mitigate the adverse impact of any increased cost of debt capital in the event of material inflation, we may enter into additional interest rate hedge arrangements in the future. The decision to enter into these agreements will be based on various factors, including the amount of our floating rate debt outstanding, our belief that material interest rate increases are likely to occur, the costs of and our expected benefit from these agreements and upon requirements of our borrowing arrangements.\nIn periods of rapid inflation, our tenants' operating costs may increase faster than revenues, which may have an adverse impact upon us if our tenants' operating income becomes insufficient to pay our rent. To mitigate the adverse impact of tenant financial distress upon us, we require many of our tenants to provide guarantees or security for our rent.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur Operating Liquidity and Resources\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $2.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents. We expect to use our cash balances, cash flow from our operations and proceeds of future property sales to fund our operations, repay debt, make distributions, purchase our common shares, acquire assets, fund tenant improvements and leasing costs and for other general business purposes. We believe our cash balances and the cash flow from our operations will be sufficient to fund our ordinary course activities.\nOur future cash flows from operating activities will depend primarily upon our:\n \u2022 ability to maintain or improve the occupancy of, and the rental rates at, our properties; \n \u2022 ability to control operating and financing cost increases at our properties; and \n \u2022 ability to purchase additional properties which produce rents, less property operating expenses, in excess of our costs of acquisition capital and which are consistent with our office repositioning strategy. \nVolatility in energy costs and real estate taxes may cause our future operating costs to fluctuate; however, the impact of these fluctuations is expected to be partially offset by the pass through of operating costs to our tenants pursuant to lease terms, although there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully offset these costs or that doing so would not negatively impact our competitive position or business.\nCash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities were $163.0 million, $1,052.1 million and $(923.2) million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016, and $181.5 million, $1,648.9 million and $(382.7) million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015. Changes in these three categories of our cash flows between 2016 and 2015 are primarily related to real estate improvements, our dispositions of properties, our purchase of our common shares, our repayments of debt, and our redemption of our preferred shares.\nOur Investment and Financing Liquidity and Resources\nIn order to maintain financial flexibility, to fund acquisitions and to meet cash needs that may result from timing differences between our receipt of rents and our desire or need to make distributions and investments or pay operating or capital expenses, we maintain an unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of institutional lenders. Our credit agreement provides us with (i) a $750.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, (ii) a $200.0 million 5-year term loan facility and (iii) a $200.0 million 7-year term loan facility. The revolving credit facility has a scheduled maturity date of January 28, 2019, which maturity date may be extended for up to two additional periods of six months at our option subject to satisfaction of certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee of 0.075% of the aggregate amount available under the revolving credit facility. The 5-year term loan and the 7-year term loan have scheduled maturity dates of January 28, 2020 and January 28, 2022, respectively.\nBorrowings under our revolving credit facility currently bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread, which was 125 basis points as of December 31, 2016. We also pay a facility fee of 25 basis points per annum on the total amount of lending commitments under our revolving credit facility. Both the interest rate spread and the facility fee are subject to adjustment based upon changes to our credit ratings. We are allowed to borrow, repay and reborrow funds available under our revolving credit facility until maturity, and no principal repayment is due until maturity. As of December 31, 2016, the interest rate payable on borrowings under our revolving credit facility was 2.02%. As of December 31, 2016, we had no balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility.\nOur term loans currently bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a spread, which was 140 and 180 basis points for the 5-year and 7-year term loan, respectively, as of December 31, 2016. The interest rate spread is subject to adjustment based upon changes to our credit ratings. As of December 31, 2016,", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are an internally managed and self-advised REIT engaged in the ownership and operation primarily of office buildings throughout the United States. We were formed in 1986 under Maryland law. On November 10, 2016, we converted to what is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership real estate investment trust, or UPREIT, structure. Substantially all of the Company's assets and liabilities are now held in an Operating Trust through which the Company conducts its business.\nAt December 31, 2016, our portfolio included 33 properties (64 buildings), one land parcel and one property taken out of service which is now classified as a land parcel, with a combined 16.1 million square feet for a total investment of $2.9 billion at cost and a depreciated book value of $2.1 billion.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our overall portfolio was 91.1% leased. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we entered into leases for 4.3 million square feet, including lease renewals for 3.1 million square feet and new leases for 1.2 million square feet. Leases entered into during the year ended December 31, 2016, including both lease renewals and new leases, had weighted average cash rental rates that were approximately 0.2% lower than prior rental rates for the same space and weighted average GAAP rental rates that were approximately 12.1% higher than prior rental rates for the same space. The change in GAAP rents is different than the change in cash rents due to differences in the amount of rent abatements, the magnitude and timing of contractual rent increases over the lease term, and the years of term for the newly executed leases compared to the prior leases.\nThroughout 2016, our management team has continued to focus on executing our plan to reshape our portfolio in order to create long-term value for shareholders. In 2016, we continued to dispose of properties that do not meet our long-term goals. Specifically, we implemented the strategy adopted by our Board of Trustees in 2014 to dispose of assets that had one or more of the following attributes:\n \u2022 assets that did not offer an opportunity to create a competitive advantage; \n \u2022 assets that were less than 150,000 square feet; \n \u2022 assets that were not office buildings; \n \u2022 assets that were not located in the U.S.; or \n \u2022 assets that produced a low cash yield or required significant capital expenditures. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we disposed of 91 properties (135 buildings) and one land parcel with a combined 18.9 million square feet for an aggregate gross sales price of $2.0 billion, excluding closing costs. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold 30 properties (62 buildings) with a combined 8.0 million square feet for an aggregate gross sales price of $1.3 billion, excluding closing costs. In January 2017, we sold 111 Market Place (one building), with 589,380 square feet for $60.1 million, excluding closing costs. As a result of these dispositions, we now have exited 90 cities, 17 states and one country. We have generated significant proceeds from our dispositions to date and have a cash balance of $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2016. For more information regarding the 2016 and 2015 dispositions, see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe are now in the process of transitioning from primarily disposing of assets to a more holistic repositioning of our portfolio consistent with the office repositioning strategy adopted by our Board of Trustees in December of 2016. Our strategy is to own and acquire at a discount to replacement cost high-quality, multi-tenant office assets in markets and sub-markets with favorable long-term supply and demand fundamentals. Our efforts will primarily be focused on larger office buildings in central business districts and major urban areas that offer an attractive quality of life, including opportunities for tenants to live and play in close proximity to where they work, with a preference for markets that have above average limitations on new supply.\nWhile executing this strategy, depending on market conditions, we may sell additional properties and are seeking to acquire attractive properties in markets meeting the criteria above. We seek to reinvest the capital received from dispositions to purchase new properties, repay debt, buy back common shares or make other investments or distributions that further our long-term strategic goals and the repositioning strategy adopted by our Board of Trustees. However, we may not be able to make suitable acquisitions or other investments with the proceeds from the dispositions. In addition, as our real estate investments have decreased, our income from operations has also declined.\nAs part of the disposition plan noted above, and pursuant to our accounting policy, in 2016, we evaluated the recoverability of the carrying values of each of the real estate assets that comprised our portfolio and determined that due to the shortening of the expected periods of ownership as a result of the disposition plan and current estimates of market value, it was necessary to reduce the net book value of a portion of the real estate assets in our portfolio to their estimated fair values. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $58.5 million for year ended December 31, 2016 in accordance with our impairment analysis procedures.\nWe have engaged CBRE, Inc. (CBRE) to provide property management services for our properties. We pay CBRE a property-by-property management fee and may engage CBRE from time-to-time to perform project management services, such as coordinating and overseeing the completion of tenant improvements and other capital projects at the properties. We reimburse CBRE for certain expenses incurred in the performance of its duties, including certain personnel and equipment costs.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we incurred expenses of $25.8 million and $42.7 million, respectively, related to our property management agreement with CBRE, for property management fees, typically calculated as a portion of the properties revenues, and salary and benefits reimbursements for property personnel, such as property managers, engineers and maintenance staff. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had amounts payable pursuant to these services of $2.7 million and $3.5 million, respectively.\nProperty Operations\nOccupancy data for 2016 and 2015 are as follows (square feet in thousands):\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>All Properties(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Comparable Properties(2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total properties\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total square feet\n</td> <td>16,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent leased(2)\n</td> <td>91.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Excludes properties sold in the period. \n (2) Based on properties owned continuously from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2016, and excludes properties sold during the period. \n (3) Percent leased includes (i) space being fitted out for occupancy pursuant to existing leases and (ii) space which is leased but is not occupied or is being offered for sublease by tenants. \nThe weighted average lease term based on square feet for leases entered into during the year ended December 31, 2016 was 8.7 years. Commitments made for leasing expenditures and concessions, such as tenant improvements and leasing commissions, for leases entered into during the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $143.0 million, or $33.31 per square foot on average (approximately $3.88 per square foot per year of the lease term).\nAs of December 31, 2016, approximately 6.0% of our leased square feet and 6.3% of our annualized rental revenue, determined as set forth below, are included in leases scheduled to expire through December 31, 2017. Renewed and new leases and rental rates at which available space may be rented in the future will depend on prevailing market conditions at the times these leases are negotiated. We believe that the in-place cash rents for leases expiring in 2017 are slightly below market.

The interest rate cap, effective April 1, 2016, has a notional amount of $400.0 million and a maturity date of March 1, 2019.\nOn May 15, 2016, we redeemed all of our 11,000,000 outstanding series E preferred shares at a price of $25.00 per share, for a total of $275.0 million, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. The redemption payment occurred on May 16, 2016 (the first business day following the redemption date). We recorded $9.6 million related to the excess fair value of consideration paid over the carrying value of the preferred shares as a reduction to net income attributable to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOn November 10, 2016, we repaid at par $167.8 million of mortgage debt at 1735 Market Street and recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees and breakage costs. We also recognized $0.2 million of expense included in interest and other income related to an interest rate swap as a result of the early repayment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOn November 10, 2016, we converted to what is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership real estate investment trust, or UPREIT, structure. In connection with this conversion, the Company contributed substantially all of its assets to the Operating Trust, and the Operating Trust assumed substantially all of the Company's liabilities pursuant to a contribution and assignment agreement between the Company and the Operating Trust. The Company now conducts and intends to continue to conduct substantially all of its activities through the Operating Trust.\nIn connection with our conversion to an UPREIT structure, the Operating Trust entered into an amended and restated credit agreement, replacing the Company's prior credit agreement. Under the amended and restated credit agreement, the Operating Trust has assumed all obligations of the Company as borrower and the Company is released from such obligations. The amended and restated credit agreement was amended and restated primarily to facilitate changes necessary to complete convert to an UPREIT structure. The economic terms of the amended and restated credit agreement are substantially the same as the terms of the Company's prior credit agreement, providing for (i) a $750.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, (ii) a $200.0 million 5-year term loan facility and (iii) a $200.0 million 7-year term loan facility.\nOn December 15, 2016, we redeemed at par $250.0 million of our 6.25% senior unsecured notes due 2017 and recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $0.1 million from the write-off of an unamortized discount and unamortized deferred financing fees.\nFor more

\n (2) Other properties consist of properties sold. \n (3) We calculate net operating income, or NOI, as shown above. We define NOI as income from our real estate including lease termination fees received from tenants less our property operating expenses. NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions. We consider NOI to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income because it may help both investors and management to understand the operations of our properties. We use NOI internally to evaluate property level performance, and we believe that NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level and may facilitate comparisons of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs. NOI does not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, net income attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders, operating income or cash flow from operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, or as an indicator of our financial performance or liquidity, nor is this measure necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs. This measure should be considered in conjunction with net income, net income attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders, operating income and cash flow from operating activities as presented in our consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statements of comprehensive income and consolidated statements of cash flows. Other REITs and real estate companies may calculate NOI differently than we do.  We refer to the 33 properties (64 buildings) we owned continuously from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2016, as comparable properties. We refer to the sold properties as other properties. Our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, include the operating results of 33 properties for the entire periods, as we owned these properties as of January 1, 2015.\nRental income. Rental income decreased $161.3 million, or 28.3%, in the 2016 period, compared to the 2015 period, primarily due to the properties sold in 2016 and 2015, partially offset by an increase of 3.4% in rental income at the comparable properties. The increase in rental income at the comparable properties is due to an increase in straight line rent adjustments related to new leasing activity where the tenants have not yet started paying rent, partially offset by several large tenant lease expirations and lease contractions. The increase in rental income at the comparable properties is also due to charges against revenue of $2.7 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015 related to a one-time parking tax matter and a tenant lease termination at 600 West Chicago Avenue in the 2015 period.\nRental income includes increases for straight line rent adjustments totaling $14.1 million in the 2016 period and $5.3 million in the 2015 period, and net reductions for amortization of acquired real estate leases and assumed real estate lease obligations totaling $6.5 million in the 2016 period and $7.5 million in the 2015 period. Rental income also includes the recognition of lease termination fees totaling $23.4 million in the 2016 period and $8.2 million in the 2015 period.\nTenant reimbursements and other income. Tenant reimbursements and other income decreased $52.9 million, or 36.6% in the 2016 period, compared to the 2015 period primarily due to the properties sold in 2016 and 2015. Tenant reimbursements and other income decreased $4.3 million, or 5.4%, at our comparable properties primarily due to a decrease in utility reimbursements as a result of the milder winter in 2016, a decrease in real estate tax reimbursements and a bankruptcy settlement received in the prior year.\nOperating expenses. The $124.2 million, or 38.2%, decrease in operating expenses during the 2016 period as compared to the 2015 period is primarily due to the properties sold in 2016 and 2015. Operating expenses at our comparable properties decreased $0.6 million, or 0.4%, primarily due to a decrease in utility expense as a result of the milder winter in 2016, a decrease in real estate tax expense and a decrease in bad debt expense, partially offset by increases in maintenance and repairs.\nDepreciation and amortization. The decrease of $62.2 million, or 32.1%, in depreciation and amortization expense in the 2016 period when compared to the 2015 period primarily relates to properties sold in 2016 and 2015.\nGeneral and administrative. The decrease of $7.2 million, or 12.5% in general and administrative expenses primarily relates to a $7.9 million decrease related to the shareholder approved reimbursement of expenses incurred by Related/Corvex in connection with their consent solicitation to remove our former Trustees, a decrease of $2.7 million of expenses related to the termination and cooperation agreement with our former manager, and a $1.8 million decrease in litigation costs, partially offset by an increase of $2.9 million for share-based compensation expense, and $1.7 million of severance and related expenses in the 2016 period as a result of staffing reductions.\nLoss on asset impairment. The increase of $41.3 million in loss on asset impairment is due to additional charges that we incurred in the 2016 as compared to the 2015 period. We recorded impairment charges of $43.7 million in the second quarter of 2016 related to 111 Monument Circle, 101-115 W. Washington Street and 100 East Wisconsin Avenue, and $14.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 related to Parkshore Plaza, Cabot Business Park Land, 625 Crane Street and 111 Market Place based upon the shortening of our expected periods of ownership as a result of our disposition plan and updated market information in accordance with our impairment analysis procedures. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded impairment charges of $17.2 million related to 12655 Olive Boulevard, 1285 Fern Ridge Parkway and portfolios of properties located in Georgia and New York, based upon updated market information in accordance with our impairment analysis procedures.\nOperating income. The decrease of $61.9 million, or 51.0%, in operating income is primarily due to lower net operating income as a result of our smaller size portfolio of assets and an increase in the loss on asset impairment. These decreases in operating income were partially offset by a lease termination fee of $18.0 million received at 111 Monument Circle in the 2016 period and lower depreciation expense as a result of our smaller size portfolio of assets.\nInterest and other income. The increase of $4.3 million of interest and other income in the 2016 period primarily reflects interest received on higher cash balances in the current year. Interest and other income in the 2015 period primarily reflects a $3.1 million gain on the sale of securities in the first quarter of 2015.\nInterest expense. The decrease of $23.0 million, or 21.4%, in interest expense primarily reflects the prepayment of $138.8 million of our 5.75% senior unsecured notes in May 2015, the foreclosure of the $40.1 million mortgage debt balance secured by 225 Water Street in May 2015, the defeasance of the outstanding $141.4 million balance of the mortgage debt secured by 111 East Wacker Drive, one of the buildings included in the Illinois Center disposition, in August 2015, the repayment of the $116.0 mortgage debt at 111 Monument Circle in December 2015, the prepayment of $139.1 million of our 6.25% senior unsecured notes in February 2016, the repayment of the $167.8 million mortgage debt at 1735 Market Street in November 2016, the prepayment of $250.0 million of our 6.25% senior unsecured notes in December 2016, and a decrease in amortization of deferred financing fees, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of net mortgage debt premiums and an increase in interest expense related to our term loans as a result of an increase in interest rates.\n(Loss) gain on early extinguishment of debt. We had a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $2.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $6.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The loss on early extinguishment in the 2016 period reflects the write-off of an unamortized discount and unamortized deferred financing fees related to our redemption of $139.1 million of our 6.25% senior unsecured notes due 2016 and $250.0\nmillion of our 6.25% senior unsecured notes due 2017 and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees and breakage costs incurred related to our repayment of the mortgage debt at 1735 Market Street. The gain on early extinguishment of debt in the 2015 period reflects a $17.3 million gain related to the 225 Water Street foreclosure and a $0.6 million gain related to the repayment of mortgage debt at 111 Monument Circle, partially offset by a $6.2 million loss related to the defeasance of the mortgage loan secured by 1320 Main Street, a $3.9 million loss related to the defeasance of the mortgage loan secured by 111 East Wacker Drive, one of the buildings included in the Illinois Center disposition, a $0.6 million loss related to the prepayment of mortgage debt at 2501 20th Place South, a $0.1 million loss related to the redemption of $138.8 million of our 5.75% senior unsecured notes due 2015 and a $0.4 million loss related to the termination of our prior credit agreement.\nForeign currency exchange loss. The foreign currency exchange loss for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 relates to the translation of proceeds from the sale of the Australian portfolio that were held in an Australian bank account.\nGain on sale of properties, net. Gain on sale of properties, net increased $166.5 million in the 2016 period as compared to the 2015 period due to a $16.5 million gain on the sale of Executive Park, a $5.5 million gain on the sale of 3330 N Washington Boulevard, a $14.7 million gain on the sale of 111 East Kilbourn Avenue, a $9.0 million gain on the sale of 1525 Locust Street, a $16.0 million gain on the sale of 633 Ahua Street, a $13.6 million gain on the sale of Lakewood on the Park, a $15.9 million gain on the sale of leased land, a $20.6 million gain on the sale of the downtown Austin portfolio, a $30.6 million gain on the sale of the movie theater portfolio and a $0.6 million gain on the sale of 9110 East Nichols Avenue in the first and second quarters of 2016. In the third quarter of 2016 we recorded gains of $78.2 million, $4.7 million, $8.4 million, and $7.2 million related to the sales of 111 River Street, Sky Park Centre, 8701 N Mopac and the South Carolina industrial portfolio, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2016 we recorded gains of $14.9 million, $3.1 million and $7.7 million related to the sales of 7800 Shoal Creek Boulevard, 1200 Lakeside Drive and 6200 Glenn Carlson Drive, respectively. These gains were partially offset by losses in the third quarter of 2016 of $0.7 million and $15.8 million related to the sales of Raintree Industrial Park and the Midwest portfolio, respectively.\nIn the first quarter of 2015, we sold two properties and recorded a $5.9 million gain on sale of properties. In the second quarter of 2015, we recorded gains of $41.6 million and $11.9 million related to the sales of an office portfolio in AL, LA, NC, SC and Sorrento Valley Business Park, respectively. In the third quarter of 2015, we recorded gains of $27.0 million, $17.6 million and $7.9 million related to the sales of Illinois Center, 185 Asylum Street and 16th and Race Street, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded gains of $22.8 million, $9.5 million, $8.4 million and $4.3 million related to the sales of Arizona Center, One Park Square, 4 South 84th Avenue and One South Church Avenue, respectively.\nThese gains were partially offset by a loss in the second quarter on the sale of properties in Australia of $47.9 million, which is net of the write off of approximately $63.2 million of foreign currency translation adjustments previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. We also recognized losses in the second quarter of $8.2 million and $2.3 million related to sales of a portfolio of small office and industrial properties and two properties in St. Louis, respectively, a loss in the third quarter of $12.5 million related to the sale of a portfolio in upstate New York and losses in the fourth quarter of $3.1 million and $0.4 million related to the sale of a portfolio in Georgia and the sale of 775 Ridge Lake Boulevard, respectively.\nIncome tax expense. The $1.6 million decrease in income tax expense primarily relates to a decrease in foreign tax expense due to the sale of the Australian assets in 2015 and federal income tax expense incurred in 2015 as a result of a taxable built-in gain triggered by the sale of a property that was previously owned by a C corporation. The decrease in income tax expense was partially offset by an increase in state income tax expense due to the sale of properties in certain states.\nPreferred distributions. The $10.0 million decrease in preferred distributions relates to the redemption of all of our 11,000,000 outstanding series E preferred shares on May 15, 2016.\nExcess fair value of consideration paid over carrying value of preferred shares. On May 15, 2016, we redeemed all of our 11,000,000 outstanding series E preferred shares at a price of $25.00 per share and recorded $9.6 million related to the excess fair value of consideration paid over the carrying value of the preferred shares as a reduction to net income attributable to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear Ended December 31,

1, 2014 to December 31, 2015.\n (1) Other properties consist of properties sold. \n (2) See Note 3 on page 33 for further information regarding NOI. \nWe refer to the 65 properties (127 buildings) we owned continuously from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2015, as comparable properties. We refer to the sold properties as other properties. Our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 include the operating results of 65 properties for the entire periods, as we owned these properties as of January 1, 2014.\nRental income. Rental income decreased $121.3 million in the 2015 period, compared to the 2014 period, primarily due to the properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2015. Our rental income from comparable properties increased $1.2 million primarily due to an increase in the recognition of lease termination fees and increases due to the write offs in 2014 of an acquired real estate lease after a tenant vacated its space prior to the lease expiration and of a deferred rent receivable after a tenant contracted its lease space. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in rental income due to leasing activity in 2015 at a particular\nbuilding where one tenant vacated its space and two tenants shortened their remaining lease terms. In connection with these leasing transactions, the corresponding deferred rent receivable balances were written off or amortized over the shorter term. The increase in rental income was also partially offset by charges against revenues of $2.7 million related to a parking tax matter and a tenant lease termination at 600 West Chicago Avenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nRental income includes increases for straight line rent adjustments totaling $5.3 million in the 2015 period and $12.5 million in the 2014 period, and net reductions for amortization of acquired real estate leases and assumed real estate lease obligations totaling $7.5 million in the 2015 period and $10.6 million in the 2014 period. Rental income also includes the recognition of lease termination fees totaling $8.2 million in the 2015 period and $4.7 million in the 2014 period.\nTenant reimbursements and other income. Tenant reimbursements and other income decreased $25.6 million in the 2015 period, compared to the 2014 period primarily due to the properties sold in 2015 and a $1.3 million decrease at our comparable properties primarily resulting from non-recurring prior year utility expense reimbursement.\nOperating expenses. The $63.0 million decrease in operating expenses during the 2015 period as compared to the 2014 period is primarily due to the properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2015, partially offset by a $0.8 million increase at our comparable properties. The increase in operating expenses at the comparable properties primarily reflects increases in real estate tax expense related to increases in assessed values, bad debt expense primarily due to an evicted tenant, property related legal fees, maintenance and repairs, HVAC expenses and cleaning expenses, partially offset by decreases in management fees and increases in real estate tax refunds in 2015 related to prior year real estate taxes.\nDepreciation and amortization. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in the 2015 period when compared to the 2014 period primarily relates to properties sold in 2015. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the leasing transactions discussed above, where due to one tenant vacating its space and two other tenants shortening their remaining lease term, the corresponding tenant improvements were written off or depreciation was accelerated.\nGeneral and administrative. The decrease in general and administrative expenses primarily relates to $43.9 million of business management and incentive fees paid to our prior external manager in 2014, a $14.5 million decrease related to the shareholder approved reimbursement of expenses incurred by Related/Corvex in connection with their consent solicitation to remove our former Trustees, and a $9.4 million decrease in legal and litigation costs, partially offset by the internalization of our management, which includes a $9.5 million increase in share-based compensation expense.\nLoss on asset impairment. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded an impairment charge of $17.2 million related to 12655 Olive Boulevard, 1285 Fern Ridge Parkway and portfolios of properties located in Georgia and New York, based upon updated market information in accordance with our impairment analysis procedures. The impairment charge in 2014 includes $22.7 million related to 225 Water Street where we made the decision to cease making loan servicing payments and impairment losses recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014 as a result of the change in the anticipated holding period for certain properties.\nInterest and other income. The increase in interest and other income primarily relates to a $3.1 million gain on the sale of securities in the first quarter of 2015 and an increase in bank interest income due to a higher average cash balance during the 2015 period as compared to the 2014 period.\nInterest expense. The decrease in interest expense in the 2015 period primarily reflects the payment of the $235.0 million balance on our revolving credit facility in July 2014, the prepayment of $265.0 million of 5.68% mortgage debt in August 2014, the prepayment of $33.4 million of our 6.40% unsecured notes in September 2014, the prepayment of $125.0 million of our 7.50% unsecured notes in November 2014 the payment of $100.0 million of our term loan in December 2014, the prepayment of $138.8 million of our 5.75% senior unsecured notes due 2015 in May 2015, the foreclosure of 225 Water Street in May 2015 and the defeasance of the outstanding balance of the mortgage debt secured by 111 East Wacker Drive, one of the buildings included in Illinois Center, in August 2015.\nGain on early extinguishment of debt. The gain on early extinguishment of debt in the 2015 period reflects a $17.3 million gain related to the 225 Water Street foreclosure and a $0.6 million gain related to the repayment of mortgage debt at 111 Monument Circle, partially offset by a $6.2 million loss related to the defeasance of the mortgage loan secured by 1320 Main Street, a $3.9 million loss related to the defeasance of the mortgage loan secured by 111 East Wacker Drive, a $0.6 million loss related to the prepayment of mortgage debt at 2501 20th Place South, a $0.1 million loss related to the redemption of $138.8 million of our 5.75% senior notes and a $0.4 million loss related to the new credit agreement entered into in January 2015, which resulted in the termination of our prior credit agreement. The gain on early extinguishment of debt in the 2014 period primarily reflects the write-\noff of unamortized premiums and deferred financing fees related to the prepayment of $265.0 million of 5.68% mortgage debt at 600 West Chicago Avenue in August 2014, partially offset by the write off of deferred financing fees related to the prepayment of $125.0 million of our 7.50% unsecured senior notes due 2019.\nGain on sale of equity investments. The gain on sale of equity investments in the 2014 period reflects the sale on July 9, 2014 of our entire stake of 22,000,000 common shares of SIR at a per share sales price in excess of our per share carrying value, partially offset by a loss on the sale of our investment in AIC in May 2014.\nGain on issuance of shares by an equity investee. The gain on issuance of shares by an equity investee primarily reflects the issuance of 10,000,000 common shares by SIR during the second quarter of 2014 at prices above our per share carrying value.\nForeign currency exchange loss. The foreign currency exchange loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 relates to the change in foreign currency rates resulting in losses on cash proceeds from the Australian portfolio disposition maintained in an Australian bank account prior to the transfer of cash from our Australian subsidiary to our U.S bank accounts.\nGain on sale of properties, net. In the first quarter of 2015, we sold two properties and recorded a $5.9 million gain on sale of properties. In the second quarter of 2015, we recorded gains of $41.6 million and $11.9 million related to the sales of an office portfolio in AL, LA, NC, SC and Sorrento Valley Business Park, respectively. In the third quarter of 2015, we recorded gains of $27.0 million, $17.6 million and $7.9 million related to the sales of Illinois Center, 185 Asylum Street and 16th and Race Street, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded gains of $22.8 million, $9.5 million, $8.4 million and $4.3 million related to the sales of Arizona Center, One Park Square, 4 South 84th Avenue and One South Church Avenue, respectively.\nThese gains were partially offset by a loss in the second quarter on the sale of properties in Australia of $47.9 million, which is net of the write off of approximately $63.2 million of foreign currency translation adjustments previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. We also recognized losses in the second quarter of $8.2 million and $2.3 million related to sales of a portfolio of small office and industrial properties and two properties in St. Louis, respectively a loss in the third quarter of $12.5 million related to the sale of a portfolio in upstate New York and losses in the fourth quarter of $3.1 million and $0.4 million related to the sale of a portfolio in Georgia and the sale of 775 Ridge Lake Boulevard, respectively.\nIncome tax expense. The decrease in income tax expense relates to a decrease in foreign tax expense related to the Australian assets, which were sold in June 2015. The decrease in the foreign tax expense was partially offset by federal income tax expense in the second quarter of 2015 incurred as a result of a taxable built-in gain triggered by the sale of a property that was previously owned by a C corporation.\nEquity in earnings of investees. Equity in earnings of investees represents our proportionate share of earnings from SIR during the 2014 period prior to the sale of our entire stake of 22,000,000 common shares of SIR on July 9, 2014 and our proportionate share of earnings from AIC during the 2014 period prior to the sale of our investment in AIC on May 9, 2014.\nIncome from discontinued operations. In 2015, we adopted ASU 2014-08 and did not classify the properties sold in 2015 as discontinued operations in accordance with this guidance. Income from discontinued operations in the 2014 period relates to 14 properties (43 buildings) sold in 2014.\nLoss on asset impairment from discontinued operations. The 2014 loss on asset impairment reflects the write down to estimated fair value less costs to sell for 14 properties (43 buildings) sold during 2014.\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt from discontinued operations. The 2014 loss on early extinguishment of debt reflects prepayment premiums and the write off of unamortized discounts and deferred financing fees associated with the repayment of $11.2 million of 6.14% mortgage debt and $8.5 million of 5.78% mortgage debt in June 2014.\nPreferred distributions. The decrease in preferred distributions reflects the conversion of 10,264,503 of our series D preferred shares into 10,412,499 of our common shares during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nExcess fair value of consideration over carrying value of preferred shares. As a result of the conversion of our series D preferred shares in May 2014, we recorded a preferred distribution of $16.2 million for the excess of the market value of the common shares issued above the carrying value of the series D preferred shares converted.\nInflation\nInflation in the past several years in the United States has been modest. Future inflation might have either positive or negative impacts on our business. Inflation might cause the value of our real estate to increase. Inflation might also cause our costs of equity and debt capital and operating costs to increase. An increase in our capital costs or in our operating costs may result in decreased earnings unless it is offset by increased revenues. Further inflation may permit us to increase rents upon renewal or enter new leases above the previous rent amounts for the leased space.\nTo mitigate the adverse impact of any increased cost of debt capital in the event of material inflation, we may enter into additional interest rate hedge arrangements in the future. The decision to enter into these agreements will be based on various factors, including the amount of our floating rate debt outstanding, our belief that material interest rate increases are likely to occur, the costs of and our expected benefit from these agreements and upon requirements of our borrowing arrangements.\nIn periods of rapid inflation, our tenants' operating costs may increase faster than revenues, which may have an adverse impact upon us if our tenants' operating income becomes insufficient to pay our rent. To mitigate the adverse impact of tenant financial distress upon us, we require many of our tenants to provide guarantees or security for our rent.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur Operating Liquidity and Resources\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $2.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents. We expect to use our cash balances, cash flow from our operations and proceeds of future property sales to fund our operations, repay debt, make distributions, purchase our common shares, acquire assets, fund tenant improvements and leasing costs and for other general business purposes. We believe our cash balances and the cash flow from our operations will be sufficient to fund our ordinary course activities.\nOur future cash flows from operating activities will depend primarily upon our:\n \u2022 ability to maintain or improve the occupancy of, and the rental rates at, our properties; \n \u2022 ability to control operating and financing cost increases at our properties; and \n \u2022 ability to purchase additional properties which produce rents, less property operating expenses, in excess of our costs of acquisition capital and which are consistent with our office repositioning strategy. \nVolatility in energy costs and real estate taxes may cause our future operating costs to fluctuate; however, the impact of these fluctuations is expected to be partially offset by the pass through of operating costs to our tenants pursuant to lease terms, although there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully offset these costs or that doing so would not negatively impact our competitive position or business.\nCash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities were $163.0 million, $1,052.1 million and $(923.2) million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016, and $181.5 million, $1,648.9 million and $(382.7) million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015. Changes in these three categories of our cash flows between 2016 and 2015 are primarily related to real estate improvements, our dispositions of properties, our purchase of our common shares, our repayments of debt, and our redemption of our preferred shares.\nOur Investment and Financing Liquidity and Resources\nIn order to maintain financial flexibility, to fund acquisitions and to meet cash needs that may result from timing differences between our receipt of rents and our desire or need to make distributions and investments or pay operating or capital expenses, we maintain an unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of institutional lenders. Our credit agreement provides us with (i) a $750.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, (ii) a $200.0 million 5-year term loan facility and (iii) a $200.0 million 7-year term loan facility. The revolving credit facility has a scheduled maturity date of January 28, 2019, which maturity date may be extended for up to two additional periods of six months at our option subject to satisfaction of certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee of 0.075% of the aggregate amount available under the revolving credit facility. The 5-year term loan and the 7-year term loan have scheduled maturity dates of January 28, 2020 and January 28, 2022, respectively.\nBorrowings under our revolving credit facility currently bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread, which was 125 basis points as of December 31, 2016. We also pay a facility fee of 25 basis points per annum on the total amount of lending commitments under our revolving credit facility. Both the interest rate spread and the facility fee are subject to adjustment based upon changes to our credit ratings. We are allowed to borrow, repay and reborrow funds available under our revolving credit facility until maturity, and no principal repayment is due until maturity. As of December 31, 2016, the interest rate payable on borrowings under our revolving credit facility was 2.02%. As of December 31, 2016, we had no balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility.\nOur term loans currently bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a spread, which was 140 and 180 basis points for the 5-year and 7-year term loan, respectively, as of December 31, 2016. The interest rate spread is subject to adjustment based upon changes to our credit ratings. As of December 31, 2016,"}
