The following discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties. See Part I ( Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d) and Part I, Item 1A ( Risk Factors\u201d).\nOverview\nWe provide compression services in a number of shale plays throughout the U.S., including the Utica, Marcellus, Permian Basin, Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Mississippi Lime, Granite Wash, Woodford, Barnett, Haynesville, Niobrara and Fayetteville shales. The demand for our services is driven by the domestic production of natural gas and crude oil; as such, we have focused our activities in areas of attractive natural gas and crude oil production growth, which are generally found in these shale and unconventional resource plays. According to studies promulgated by the Energy Information Agency ( EIA\u201d), the production and transportation volumes in these shale plays are expected to increase over the long term due to the comparatively attractive economic returns versus returns achieved in many conventional basins. Furthermore, the changes in production volumes and pressures of shale plays over time require a wider range of compression services than in conventional basins. We believe the flexibility of our compression units positions us well to meet these changing operating conditions. While our business focuses largely on compression services serving infrastructure applications, including centralized natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities, which utilize large horsepower compression units, typically in shale plays, we also provide compression services in more mature conventional basins, including gas lift applications on crude oil wells targeted by horizontal drilling techniques. Gas lift, a process by which natural gas is injected into the production tubing of an existing producing well, thus reducing the hydrostatic pressure and allowing the oil to flow at a higher rate, and other artificial lift technologies are critical to the enhancement of oil production from horizontal wells operating in tight shale plays.\nGeneral Trends and Outlook\nWhile our business does not have direct exposure to commodity prices, the general activity levels of our customers can be affected by commodity prices. A significant amount of our assets are utilized in natural gas infrastructure applications, primarily in centralized natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities. Given the project nature of these applications and long-term investment horizon of our customers, we have generally experienced stability in rates and higher sustained utilization rates relative to other businesses more tied to drilling activity and wellhead economics. In addition to assets utilized in infrastructure applications, a small portion of our fleet is used in connection with crude oil production using horizontal drilling techniques.\nThe relative increase in, and stabilization of, commodity prices during the second-half of 2016 and throughout 2017 has allowed our customers to increase their capital budgets in regards to crude oil exploration and production activities and the build-out of large-scale natural gas infrastructure projects, particularly in areas with favorable economics. These projects increased demand for our compression services throughout 2017 as we saw our horsepower utilization increase from 87.1% at December 31, 2016 to 94.8% at December 31, 2017, while also increasing the horsepower in our fleet from 1,720,547 at December 31, 2016 to 1,799,781 at December 31, 2017.\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration January 2018 Short-Term Energy Outlook ( EIA Outlook\u201d) expects dry natural gas production to rise by 6.9 billion cubic feet per day ( Bcf/day\u201d) in 2018 and by 2.6 Bcf/day in 2019. If achieved, the forecasted 6.9 Bcf/day increase in 2018 would be the highest on record for any single year. The EIA Outlook expects growth to be concentrated in Appalachia's Marcellus and Utica regions, along with the Permian Basin region, all regions in which we provide compression services. Much of the expected increase in natural gas production is the result of increasing pipeline takeaway capacity out of the Marcellus and Utica producing regions to end-use markets. Additionally, EIA Outlook projects liquefied natural gas ( LNG\u201d) gross exports will average 3.0 Bcf/day in 2018, up from 1.9 Bcf/day in 2017. The EIA Outlook expects U.S. liquefaction capacity will continue to expand as several new projects are expected to enter service during 2018 and 2019. Also from the EIA Outlook, natural gas pipeline exports to Mexico through October increased by 0.4 Bcf/day in 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. A relatively low natural\ngas export price, rising demand from Mexico's power sector, and increased pipeline capacity in both the U.S. and Mexico have led to increased exports.\nWe believe this increasing demand for natural gas will also create increasing demand for compression services, for both existing natural gas fields as they age and for the development of new natural gas fields. As such, we expect demand for our compression services to continue to increase throughout 2018 although we cannot predict any possible changes in such demand with reasonable certainty.\nWe intend to prudently deploy capital for new compressor units in 2018. We have already entered into commitments to purchase most of our large horsepower compressor units in 2018, as the lead time to build these units is approximately one year or shorter. Most of our 2018 purchases of large horsepower compressor units are already committed to customers or under contract with customers due to the high demand and limited supply of these units.\nThe EIA Outlook forecasts total U.S. crude oil production to average 10.3 million barrels per day in 2018, up 1.0 million barrels per day from 2017. If achieved, forecasted 2018 production would be the highest annual average on record, surpassing the previous record of 9.6 million barrels per day set in 1970. According to the EIA Outlook, in 2019, crude oil production is forecast to rise to an average of 10.8 million barrels per day and the Permian region is expected to produce 3.6 million barrels per day of crude oil by the end of 2019 which would represent about 32% of U.S. crude oil production that year. With the large geographic area of the Permian region and stacked plays, the EIA Outlook estimates that operators can continue to develop multiple tight oil layers and increase production, even with sustained crude oil prices lower than $50 per barrel. As of February 8, 2018, the WTI crude oil spot price was $61.15 per barrel. WTI crude oil spot prices are forecast within the EIA Outlook to average $56 per barrel in 2018 and $57 per barrel in 2019. Daily and monthly average crude oil prices could vary significantly from annual average forecasts due to global economic developments and geopolitical events in the coming months that could have the potential to push oil prices higher or lower than forecast. Uncertainty remains regarding the duration of, and adherence to, the current Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC\u201d) production cuts, which could influence prices in either direction.\nWe believe the relative increase in, and stabilization of, crude oil prices in the second half of 2016 and throughout 2017 has led to an increase in drilling activity, and combined with the continued development of horizontal drilling technology, operators are able to produce new volumes of crude oil from tight, high pressure reservoirs. Due in part to these higher initial pressures, the increase in demand for gas lift compression in these new areas of drilling could be delayed until reservoir pressures decline to a point where compression is beneficial to the economics of a particular well or basin. However, we have experienced an increase in the demand for our smaller horsepower units engaged in gas lift applications and expect that to continue.\nOperating Highlights\nThe following table summarizes certain horsepower and horsepower utilization percentages for the periods presented.\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercent Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating Data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFleet horsepower (at period end) (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,799,781 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,720,547 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,712,196 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.6\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n0.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal available horsepower (at period end) (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,950,301 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,730,547 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,712,196 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n1.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRevenue generating horsepower (at period end) (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,624,377 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,387,073 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,424,537 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(2.6)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAverage revenue generating horsepower (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,505,657 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,377,966 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,408,689 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(2.2)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAverage revenue per revenue generating horsepower per month (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n15.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n15.41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n15.90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.2)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(3.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRevenue generating compression units (at period end)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(6.8)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAverage horsepower per revenue generating compression unit (6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n3.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nHorsepower utilization (7):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAt period end\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n94.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n87.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n89.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n8.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(2.4)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAverage for the period (8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n92.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n87.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n90.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n5.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(3.4)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFleet horsepower is horsepower for compression units that have been delivered to us (and excludes units on order).

The 17.1% increase in revenue generating horsepower as of December 31, 2017 over December 31, 2016 was primarily due to organic growth in our active fleet and redeployment of previously idle equipment. The 3.7% increase in average horsepower per revenue generating compression unit as of December 31, 2017 over December 31, 2016 was primarily due to the addition of large horsepower compression units in the operating fleet. The 2.2% decrease in average revenue per revenue generating horsepower per month for the year ended December 31, 2017 over December 31, 2016 was primarily due to (1) reduced pricing in the small horsepower portion of our fleet in the current period and (2) an increase in the average horsepower per revenue generating compression unit in the current period, resulting from an increase in the number of large horsepower compression units which typically generate lower average revenue per revenue generating horsepower than do small horsepower compression units.\nThe 0.5% increase in fleet horsepower as of December 31, 2016 over the fleet horsepower as of December 31, 2015 was attributable to new compression units added to our fleet to meet then expected demand by new and current customers for compression services. The 2.6% decrease in revenue generating horsepower as of December 31, 2016 over December 31, 2015 was primarily due to an increase in the amount of time required to contract services for new compression units and an increase in the amount of compression units returned to us. The 3.3% increase in average horsepower per revenue generating compression unit as of December 31, 2016 over December 31, 2015 was primarily due to the addition of large horsepower compression units in the operating fleet and the decline in utilization of small horsepower units over the year ended December 31, 2016. The 3.1% decrease in average revenue per revenue generating horsepower per month for the year ended December 31, 2016 over December 31, 2015 was primarily due to (1) reduced pricing in the small horsepower portion of our fleet in the current period and (2) an increase in the average horsepower per revenue generating compression unit in the current period, resulting from an increase in the number of large horsepower compression units which typically generate lower average revenue per revenue generating horsepower than do small horsepower compression units.\nAverage horsepower utilization increased to 92.0% during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 87.4% during the year ended December 31, 2016.

We believe the increase in average horsepower utilization is the result of increased demand for our services commensurate with increased operating activity in the oil and gas industry. The above noted fluctuation in utilization components also describes the changes in period end horsepower utilization as of December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016.\nAverage horsepower utilization decreased to 87.4% during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 90.5% during the year ended December 31, 2015. The 3.1% decrease in average horsepower utilization was primarily attributable to the following changes as a percentage of total available horsepower: (1) a 3.7% increase in our average fleet of compression units returned to us not yet under contract and (2) a 1.0% decrease in horsepower that was on-contract or pending-contract but not yet active. The decrease in average horsepower utilization was offset by a 2.6% increase in idle horsepower under repair, which is excluded from the average horsepower utilization calculation until such repair is complete. We believe the decrease in average horsepower utilization was the result of a delay in planned projects of certain of our customers, continued optimization of existing compression service requirements by our customers and our selective pursuit of what we deemed to be the most attractive opportunities. The above noted fluctuation in utilization components also describes the changes in period end horsepower utilization, except that we experienced a 1.2% increase in horsepower that was on-contract or pending-contract but not yet active as of December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015.\nAverage horsepower utilization based on revenue generating horsepower and fleet horsepower increased to 85.9% during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 80.3% during the year ended December 31, 2016. The 5.6% increase was primarily attributable to the following changes as a percentage of total fleet horsepower: (1) a 4.0% decrease in idle horsepower under repair and (2) a 2.0% decrease in our average idle fleet composed of new compression units offset by (3) a 0.4% increase in our average idle fleet from compression units returned to us. The overall decrease in idle horsepower is the result of increased demand for our services commensurate with increased operating activity in the oil and gas industry. These factors also describe the variances in period end horsepower utilization based on revenue generating horsepower and fleet horsepower between the year ended December 31, 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAverage horsepower utilization based on revenue generating horsepower and fleet horsepower decreased to 80.3% during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 85.1% during the year ended December 31, 2015.

During 2017, we experienced a year-to-year increase in demand for our compression services driven by increased operating activity in natural gas and crude oil production, resulting in a $17.4 million increase in our contract operations revenue. Average revenue generating horsepower increased 9.3% during the year ended December 31, 2017 over December 31, 2016 while average revenue per revenue generating horsepower per month decreased from $15.41 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $15.07 for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of 2.2%, attributable, in part, to reduced pricing in the current period in the small horsepower portion of our fleet. The decrease in average revenue per revenue generating horsepower per month was also attributable to the 3.7% increase in the average horsepower per revenue generating compression unit in the current period, as large horsepower compression units typically generate lower average monthly revenue per revenue generating horsepower than do small horsepower compression units. Average revenue per revenue generating horsepower per month associated with our compression services provided on a month-to-month basis did not significantly differ from the average revenue per revenue generating horsepower per month associated with our compression services provided under contracts in the primary term. Our contract operations revenue was not materially impacted by any renegotiations of our contracts during the period with our customers.\nParts and service revenue. Parts and service revenue was earned primarily on the installation of equipment ancillary to compression operations. The $3.1 million decrease in parts and service revenue was primarily attributable to (1) an $8.3 million decrease in revenue associated with installation services offset by (2) a $4.1 million increase in maintenance work on units at our customers' locations that are outside the scope of our core maintenance activities and (3) a $1.4 million increase in freight and crane charges that are directly reimbursable by our customers. We offer these\nservices as a courtesy to our customers and the demand fluctuates from period to period based on the varying needs of our customers.\nCost of operations, exclusive of depreciation and amortization. The $4.4 million increase in cost of operations was primarily attributable to (1) a $7.4 million increase in direct expenses, such as parts and fluids expenses and (2) a $2.4 million increase in direct labor expenses offset by (3) a $3.5 million decrease in retail parts and service expenses, which have a corresponding decrease in parts and service revenue, and (4) a $2.7 million decrease in property and other taxes. The increase in direct parts, fluids and labor are primarily driven by the increase in average revenue generating horsepower during the current period.\nGross operating margin. The $9.9 million increase in gross operating margin was primarily due to an increase in revenues, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. The $3.0 million increase in selling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to (1) a $1.3 million increase in unit-based compensation expense, (2) a $0.8 million increase in bad debt expense, due to a $1.1 million recovery of bad debt expense during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to a $0.3 million recovery during the year ended December 31, 2017 and (3) $0.5 million increase in transaction expenses related to potential acquisitions. Unit-based compensation expense increased primarily due to a greater fair value assigned to the 2016 Performance Units\u201d that are subject to market criteria and which were measured using the Monte Carlo simulation model as of December 31, 2017.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. The $6.3 million increase in depreciation expense was primarily related to an increase in gross property and equipment balances during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to gross balances during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nLoss (gain) on disposition of assets. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the $0.5 million gain was primarily attributable to the sale of select compression equipment. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we abandoned certain assets and incurred a $1.0 million loss.\nImpairment of compression equipment. The $5.0 million and $5.8 million impairment charge during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, were primarily a result of our evaluation of the future deployment of our current idle fleet under the current market conditions. Our evaluation determined that due to certain performance characteristics of the impaired equipment, such as excessive maintenance costs and the inability of the equipment to meet then-current emission standards without retrofitting, this equipment was unlikely to be accepted by customers under then-current market conditions. As a result of our evaluation during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we determined to retire and either sell or re-utilize the key components of 40 and 29 compression units, with a total of approximately 11,000 and 15,000 horsepower, respectively, that had been previously used to provide compression services in our business.\nInterest expense, net. The $4.0 million increase in interest expense, net was primarily attributable to the impact of an increase in our weighted average interest rate. Our revolving credit facility bore an interest rate of 3.46% and 2.94% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and a weighted-average interest rate of 3.14% and 2.55% during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The impact of the increase in interest rate was partially offset by the impact of an $8.9 million decrease in average outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Average borrowings under the facility were $734.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $743.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nIncome tax expense. This line item represents the Revised Texas Franchise Tax ( Texas Margin Tax\u201d) and change in deferred tax liability, which is materially consistent between both periods.\nYear ended December 31,

During 2016, we experienced a year-to-year decrease in demand for our compression services driven by decreased operating activity in natural gas and crude oil production and continued optimization of existing compression service requirements, resulting in a 2.2% decrease in average revenue generating horsepower and a $16.9 million decrease in our contract operations revenue. Average revenue per revenue generating horsepower per month decreased from $15.90 for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $15.41 for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of 3.1%, attributable, in part, to reduced pricing in the current period in the small horsepower portion of our fleet. The decrease in average revenue per revenue generating horsepower per month was also attributable to the 3.3% increase in the average horsepower per revenue generating compression unit in the current period, as large horsepower compression units generally generate lower average monthly revenue per revenue generating horsepower than do small horsepower compression units. Average revenue per revenue generating horsepower per month associated with our compression services provided on a month-to-month basis was somewhat higher than the average revenue per revenue generating horsepower per month associated with our compression services provided under contracts in the primary term due to pressure on service rates attributable to the small horsepower portion of our fleet. Because the demand for our services is driven primarily by production of natural gas, we focus our activities in areas of attractive growth, which are generally found in certain shale and unconventional resource plays, as discussed above under the heading Overview.\u201d Our contract operations revenue was not materially impacted by any renegotiations of our contracts during the period with our customers.\nParts and service revenue. Parts and service revenue was earned primarily on the installation of equipment ancillary to compression operations. During 2016, we recognized $15.7 million of revenue associated with installation services, which accounts for the $12.2 million year-over-year increase in parts and service revenue. The remaining component of our parts and service revenue, which was earned primarily on (1) freight and crane charges that are directly reimbursed by our customers, for which we earn little to no margin, and (2) maintenance work on units at our customers' locations\nthat are outside the scope of our core maintenance activities, for which we earn lower margins than our contract operations, decreased $3.5 million during the current period.\nCost of operations, exclusive of depreciation and amortization. The $6.6 million increase in cost of operations was primarily attributable to an $8.3 million increase in retail parts and service expenses, which includes $11.9 million of additional costs associated with our installation services. Excluding these costs, retail parts and services expense decreased $3.6 million reflecting a corresponding decrease in this component of parts and services revenue. Additionally during the period, we experienced (1) a $2.1 million decrease in direct expenses, such as parts and fluids expenses, (2) a $0.6 million decrease in direct labor expenses and (3) a $0.5 million decrease in expenses related to our vehicle fleet, offset by (4) a $1.7 million increase in property and other taxes. The decrease in direct parts, fluids, labor and vehicle expenses are primarily driven by the decrease in average revenue generating horsepower during the current period.\nGross operating margin. The $11.2 million decrease in gross operating margin was primarily due to a decrease in revenues, partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses and the $3.8 million of gross operating margin we earned from our installation services during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. The $3.5 million increase in selling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to a $6.5 million increase in unit-based compensation expense, partially offset by a $2.9 million decrease in bad debt expense. Unit-based compensation expense increased primarily due to (1) the increase in our unit price as of December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015, (2) a greater number of outstanding phantom units as of December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 which resulted from a higher number of phantom unit grants during 2016 as compared to 2015 (reflecting our sharply lower unit price at the time the grants were made in 2016 versus our unit price at the time the grants were made in 2015), and (3) a greater number of phantom units outstanding on which distribution equivalent rights were paid as of each record date during the comparable periods. The decrease in bad debt expense was due primarily to a $1.1 million decrease in allowance for doubtful accounts during the year ended December 31, 2016 due in part to collections on accounts that had previously been reserved during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to a $1.8 million increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. The $7.1 million increase in depreciation expense was related to an increase in gross property and equipment balances during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to gross balances during the year ended December 31, 2015. There is no variance in amortization expense between the periods, as intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis and there has been no change in gross identifiable intangible assets between the periods.\nLoss (gain) on disposition of assets. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we abandoned certain assets and incurred a $1.0 million loss. The $1.0 million gain on sale of assets during the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to $1.2 million cash insurance recoveries on previously impaired compression equipment received during the year and $1.1 million gain on sale of 18 units, or 7,200 horsepower, offset by $1.3 million of losses incurred in the disposal of various unit and non-unit assets.\nImpairment of compression equipment. The $5.8 million and $27.3 million impairment charge during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were primarily a result of our evaluation of the future deployment of our current idle fleet under the current market conditions. Our evaluation determined that due to certain performance characteristics of the impaired equipment, such as excessive maintenance costs and the inability of the equipment to meet current emission standards without retrofitting, this equipment was unlikely to be accepted by customers under current market conditions. As a result of our evaluation during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we determined to retire and either sell or re-utilize the key components of 29 and 166 compression units, with a total of approximately 15,000 and 58,000 horsepower, respectively, that had been previously used to provide compression services in our business.\nGoodwill impairment. There was no impairment of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a $172.2 million impairment of goodwill due primarily to the decline in our unit\nprice, the sustained decline in global commodity prices, expected reduction in the capital budgets of certain of our customers and the impact these factors have on our expected future cash flows.\nInterest expense, net. The $3.5 million increase in interest expense, net was primarily attributable to the impact of an approximately $20.2 million increase in average outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility, in which average borrowings were $743.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $723.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our revolving credit facility had an interest rate of 2.94% and 2.26% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and a weighted-average interest rate of 2.55% and 2.24% during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nIncome tax expense. This line item represents the Texas Margin Tax. The decrease in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 was primarily associated with the establishment of a deferred tax liability reflecting the book/tax basis difference in our property and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOther Financial Data\nThe following table summarizes other financial data for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercent Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther Financial Data: (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross operating margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n187,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n177,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n189,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.6\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(6.0)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross operating margin percentage (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n67.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n66.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n69.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n0.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(4.4)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n155,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n146,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n153,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(4.5)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdjusted EBITDA percentage (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n55.6\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n55.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n56.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n0.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(2.8)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDCF (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n118,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n118,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n120,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(2.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDCF Coverage Ratio (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.89\n</td> <td>\nx\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.00\n</td> <td>\nx\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(11.0)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(14.5)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash Coverage Ratio (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.02\n</td> <td>\nx\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.26\n</td> <td>\nx\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(19.0)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(51.2)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nGross operating margin, Adjusted EBITDA, DCF, DCF Coverage Ratio and Cash Coverage Ratio are all non-GAAP financial measures.

The $9.1 million, or 6.2%, increase in Adjusted EBITDA during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to a $9.9 million increase in gross operating margin offset by $0.9 million higher selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding unit-based compensation expense, severance charges and transaction expenses, during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe $6.9 million, or 4.5%, decrease in Adjusted EBITDA during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to an $11.2 million decrease in gross operating margin offset by $4.4 million lower selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding unit-based compensation expense, severance charges and transaction expenses, during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nDistributable Cash Flow. DCF during the year ended December 31, 2017 was materially consistent with DCF during the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to $9.9 million increase in gross operating margin, offset by $4.8 million higher maintenance capital expenditures, $4.0 million higher cash interest expense, net and $0.9 million\nhigher selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding unit-based compensation expense, severance charges and transaction expenses during the comparable period.\nThe $2.5 million, or 2.1%, decrease in DCF during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to $11.2 million decrease in gross operating margin, $3.1 million higher cash interest expense, net and $1.1 million lower insurance recoveries received, offset by $8.4 million lower maintenance capital expenditures, $4.4 million lower selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding unit-based compensation expense, severance charges and transaction expenses during the comparable period.\nCoverage Ratios. The decrease in DCF Coverage Ratio is due to a greater number of common units outstanding as of the respective record dates during the year ended December 31, 2017. The disproportionate decrease in Cash Coverage Ratio (as compared to DCF Coverage Ratio) is due to period-to-period decreases in DRIP participation.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nWe operate in a capital-intensive industry, and our primary liquidity needs are to finance the purchase of additional compression units and make other capital expenditures, service our debt, fund working capital, and pay distributions. Our principal sources of liquidity include cash generated by operating activities, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and issuances of debt and equity securities, including under the DRIP.\nWe believe cash generated by operating activities and, where necessary, borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to service our debt, fund working capital, fund our estimated expansion capital expenditures, fund our maintenance capital expenditures and pay distributions through 2018. Because we distribute all of our available cash, which excludes prudent operating reserves, we expect to fund any future expansion capital expenditures or acquisitions primarily with capital from external financing sources, such as borrowings under our revolving credit facility and issuances of debt and equity securities, including under the DRIP.\nIf the CDM Acquisition and other transactions described in Item 1 ( Business-Recent Developments\u201d) are consummated, our capital expenditure requirements may increase significantly. We expect to fund any increase in capital expenditures with cash generated by operating activities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nWe are not aware of any regulatory changes or environmental liabilities that we currently expect to have a material impact on our current or future operations. Please see -Capital Expenditures\u201d below.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n124,644 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n103,697 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n117,401 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(105,231)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(50,831)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(278,158)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(19,431)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(52,808)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n160,758\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities. The $20.9 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was due primarily to $9.9 million higher gross operating margin, adjustments to non-cash and other items and changes in our working capital.\nThe $13.7 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was due primarily to $11.2 million lower gross operating margin, adjustments to non-cash and other items and changes in our working capital.\nNet cash used in investing activities. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in investing activities related primarily to purchases of new compression units, reconfiguration costs and related equipment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash used in investing activities related primarily to purchases of new compression units, reconfiguration costs and related equipment. We significantly reduced our purchases of new compression units during 2016 due to the reduced activity levels in the overall energy market.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in investing activities related primarily to purchases of new compression units and related equipment in response to increased demand for our services and maintenance capital expenditures made to maintain or replace existing assets and operating capacity, partially offset by $1.7 million of proceeds from the disposition of equipment during 2015 and $1.2 million of proceeds from insurance recoveries on previously impaired compression units during 2015.\nNet cash provided by financing activities. During 2017, we borrowed $97.5 million, on a net basis, on our revolving credit facility from which we borrow primarily to support our purchases of new compression units, reconfiguration costs and related equipment, as described above. Additionally, we made cash distributions to our unitholders of $114.1 million and paid $2.8 million in cash related to the net settlement of unit-based awards.\nDuring 2016, we paid $43.8 million, on a net basis, on our revolving credit facility from which we borrow primarily to support our purchases of new compression units, reconfiguration costs and related equipment, as described above. During December 2016, we completed a public equity offering and utilized net proceeds of $80.9 million to reduce indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Additionally, we paid various loan fees and incurred costs of $2.0 million related to an amendment to our revolving credit facility. During 2016, we made cash distributions to our unitholders of $87.7 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we borrowed $134.3 million, on a net basis, primarily to support our purchases of new compression units and related equipment, as described above. During 2015, we completed a public equity offering and a private placement and utilized combined net proceeds of $75.1 million to reduce indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Additionally, in January 2015, we paid various loan fees and incurred costs of $3.4 million related to an amendment to our revolving credit facility. During 2015, we made cash distributions to our unitholders of $45.1 million.\nEquity Offerings\nOn December 8, 2016, we closed a public offering of 5,175,000 common units at a price to the public of $16.25 per common unit. We used the net proceeds of $80.9 million (net of underwriting discounts and commission and offering expenses) to reduce the indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility.\nOn September 15, 2015, we closed a public offering of 4,000,000 common units at a price to the public of $19.33 per common unit. We used the net proceeds of $74.4 million (net of underwriting discounts and commission and offering expenses) to reduce the indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility.\nOn May 21, 2015, we issued 34,921 common units in a private placement for $0.7 million in a transaction that was exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d). We used the proceeds from the private placement for general partnership purposes.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe compression services business is capital intensive, requiring significant investment to maintain, expand and upgrade existing operations. Our capital requirements have consisted primarily of, and we anticipate that our capital requirements will continue to consist primarily of, the following:\nTable 151: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nmaintenance capital expenditures, which are capital expenditures made to maintain the operating capacity of our assets and extend their useful lives, to replace partially or fully depreciated assets, or other capital expenditures that are incurred in maintaining our existing business and related operating income; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nexpansion capital expenditures, which are capital expenditures made to expand the operating capacity or operating income capacity of assets, including by acquisition of compression units or through modification of existing compression units to increase their capacity, or to replace certain partially or fully depreciated assets that were not currently generating operating income.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe classify capital expenditures as maintenance or expansion on an individual asset basis. Over the long term, we expect that our maintenance capital expenditure requirements will continue to increase as the overall size and age of our fleet increases. Our aggregate maintenance capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $12.6 million and $7.7 million, respectively. We currently plan to spend approximately $15 million in maintenance capital expenditures during 2018, including parts consumed from inventory.\nGiven our growth objectives and anticipated demand from our customers as a result of the increasing natural gas activity described above under the heading -General Trends and Outlook,\u201d we anticipate that we will continue to make significant expansion capital expenditures. Without giving effect to any equipment we may acquire pursuant to any current or future acquisitions, we currently have budgeted between $130 million and $140 million in expansion capital expenditures during 2018. Our expansion capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $116.9 million and $40.9 million, respectively.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nAs of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all of our covenants under our revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $782.9 million, $272.1 million of borrowing base availability and, subject to compliance with the applicable financial covenants, available borrowing capacity of $101.6 million. The borrowing base consists of eligible accounts receivable, inventory and compression units. One of the financial covenants under our revolving credit facility permits a maximum leverage ratio of (A) 5.25 to 1.0 as of the end of the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2017 and (B) 5.00 to 1.0 thereafter. As of February 8, 2018, we had outstanding borrowings of $815.0 million. We expect to remain in compliance with our covenants throughout 2018. If our current cash flow projections prove to be inaccurate, we expect to be able to remain in compliance with such financial covenants by one or more of the following actions: issue debt and equity securities in conjunction with the acquisition of another business; issue equity in a public or private offering; request a modification of our covenants from our bank group; reduce distributions from our current distribution rate or obtain an equity infusion pursuant to the terms of our revolving credit facility.\nFor a more detailed description of our revolving credit facility including the covenants and restrictions contained therein, please refer to Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.\nCommitment Letter\nIn connection with the CDM Acquisition, on January 15, 2018, we entered into a commitment letter with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Barclays Bank PLC, as modified by the joinder to commitment letter and bridge fee letter entered into by the Partnership, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Barclays Bank PLC with each of Regions Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., MUFG Union Bank, N.A., a member of MUFG, a global financial group, The Bank of Nova Scotia and SunTrust Bank and certain affiliates of such parties (the Commitment Letter\u201d). The Commitment Letter provides for senior unsecured bridge loans in an aggregate amount up to $725 million (the Bridge Loans\u201d). The proceeds of such Bridge Loans may be used (a) to finance a portion of the purchase price of the CDM Acquisition and (b) to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith. The availability of the borrowings is subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions.\nDistribution Reinvestment Plan\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, distributions of $20.3 million were reinvested under the DRIP resulting in the issuance of 1.2 million common units. Such distributions are treated as non-cash transactions in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included under Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nFor a more detailed description of the DRIP, please refer to Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements.\nTotal Contractual Cash Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our total contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMore than\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2 - 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4 - 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n782,902 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n782,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest on long-term debt obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n54,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n27,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n27,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEquipment/capital purchases (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n122,156 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n119,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating lease obligations (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n962,626 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n148,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n814,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWe assumed that the amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2017 would be repaid in January 2020, the maturity date of the facility.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRepresents future interest payments under our revolving credit facility based on the interest rate as of December 31, 2017 of 3.46%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 156: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRepresents commitments for new compression units that are being fabricated, and is a component of our overall projected expansion capital expenditures during 2018 of $130 million to $140 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRepresents commitments for future minimum lease payments on noncancelable leases.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEffects of Inflation. Our revenues and results of operations have not been materially impacted by inflation and changing prices in the past three fiscal years.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet financing activities. Please refer to Note 13 of our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a description of our commitments and contingencies.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements. These financial statements were prepared in conformity with GAAP. As such, we are required to make\ncertain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. We base our estimates on historical experience, available information and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates; however, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The accounting policies that we believe require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and are the most critical to its reporting of results of operations and financial position are as follows:\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue using the following criteria: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (iii) the customer's price is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.\nRevenue from compression services is recognized ratably under our fixed-fee contracts over the term of the contract as compression services are provided to our customers. Compression services generally are billed monthly, one month in advance of the commencement of the service month, except for certain customers who are billed at the beginning of the service month. Amounts invoiced in advance are recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet until earned, at which time it is recognized as revenue.\nRevenue and the associated expense from installation services, which includes the installation of stations for our customers, is recorded using the percentage-of-completion method measured using the efforts-expended method. In applying the percentage-of-completion method, we use the percentage of total workflows to date that have been completed relative to estimated total workflows to be completed in order to estimate the progress towards completion to determine the amount of revenue and profit to recognize for each contract.\nThe percentage-of-completion method of revenue recognition requires us to make estimates of contract revenues and costs to complete our projects. In making such estimates, management judgments are required to evaluate significant assumptions including the cost of materials and labor, expected labor productivity, the impact of potential variances in schedule completion, the amount of net contract revenues and the impact of any penalties, claims, change orders, or performance incentives.\nBusiness Combinations and Goodwill\nGoodwill acquired in connection with business combinations represents the excess of consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired. Certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment annually based on the carrying values as of October 1, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise that suggest the carrying value of goodwill may not be recovered.\nGoodwill-Impairment Assessments\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually on October 1 of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our single business reporting unit could be less than its carrying value (including goodwill). The timing of the annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods.\nWe estimate the fair value of our reporting unit based on a number of factors, including the potential value we would receive if we sold the reporting unit, enterprise value, discount rates and projected cash flows. Estimating projected cash flows requires us to make certain assumptions as it relates to future operating performance. When considering operating performance, various factors are considered such as current and changing economic conditions and the commodity price environment, among others. Due to the imprecise nature of these projections and assumptions, actual results can and often do, differ from our estimates. If the growth assumptions embodied in the current year impairment testing prove inaccurate, we could incur an impairment charge in the future.\nOn October 1, 2017 and 2016, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test, wherein we compared the estimated fair value of our single reporting unit to its carrying value. The estimated fair value of our reporting unit, measured based on market capitalization, as of October 1, 2017 and 2016 exceeded its carrying value in excess of 20% and we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired. We recorded no goodwill impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. We had approximately $35.9 million of goodwill recorded on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nOn October 1, 2015, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and concluded that our goodwill was not impaired. We updated our impairment test as of December 31, 2015 as certain potential impairment indicators were identified during the fourth quarter, specifically (1) the decline in the market price of our common units, (2) the sustained decline in global commodity prices, and (3) the decline in performance of the Alerian MLP Index, which indicated the reporting unit had a fair value that was less than its carrying value as of December 31, 2015. We prepared a quantitative assessment as of December 31, 2015 which indicated that the calculated fair value was less than the carrying value. We subsequently performed step two\u201d impairment test for our reporting unit under which we treated our business as if it had been acquired in a business combination as of December 31, 2015 and assigned the fair value of the reporting unit to all of our assets and liabilities. The carrying value of the goodwill was compared to the new implied fair value of goodwill and an impairment was recognized for the amount of the carrying value that exceeded the implied fair value. Based on that step two impairment test, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $172.2 million. We had approximately $35.9 of goodwill remaining on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 following this impairment.\nAs discussed above, estimates of fair value can be affected by a variety of external and internal factors. Volatility in crude oil prices can cause disruptions in global energy industries and markets. Potential events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the key assumptions we used in estimating the fair value of our reporting unit include the consolidation or failure of crude oil and natural gas producers, which may result in a smaller market for services and may cause us to lose key customers, and cost-cutting efforts by crude oil and natural gas producers, which may cause us to lose current or potential customers or achieve less revenue per customer. We continue to monitor the remaining $35.9 million of goodwill and if the estimated fair value of our reporting unit declines due to any of these or other factors, we may be required to record future goodwill impairment charges.\nLong-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets, which include property and equipment, and intangible assets, comprise a significant amount of our total assets. Long-lived assets to be held and used by us are reviewed to determine whether any events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. For long-lived assets to be held and used, we base our evaluation on impairment indicators such as the nature of the assets, the future economic benefit of the assets, the consistency of performance characteristics of compression units in our idle fleet with the performance characteristics of our revenue generating horsepower, any historical or future profitability measurements and other external market conditions or factors that may be present. If such impairment indicators are present or other factors exist that indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, we determine whether an impairment has occurred through the use of an undiscounted cash flows analysis. If an impairment has occurred, we recognize a loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the asset. The fair value of the asset is measured using quoted market prices or, in the absence of quoted market prices, is based on an estimate of discounted cash flows, the expected net sale proceeds compared to other similarly configured fleet units we recently sold, a review of other units recently offered for sale by third parties, or the estimated component value of similar equipment we plan to continue to use.\nPotential events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the key assumptions we used in estimating whether or not the carrying value of our long-lived assets are recoverable include the consolidation or failure of crude oil and natural gas producers, which may result in a smaller market for services and may cause us to lose key customers, and cost-cutting efforts by crude oil and natural gas producers, which may cause us to lose current or potential customers or achieve less revenue per customer. If our projections of cash flows associated with our units decline, we may have to record an impairment of compression equipment in future periods.\nAllowances and Reserves\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on specific customer collection issues and historical experience. The determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires us to make estimates and judgments regarding our customers' ability to pay amounts due. On an ongoing basis, we conduct an evaluation of the financial strength of our customers based on payment history, the overall business climate in which our customers operate and specific identification of customer bad debt and make adjustments to the allowance as necessary. Our evaluation of our customers' financial strength is based on the aging of their respective receivables balance, customer correspondence, financial information and third-party credit ratings. Our evaluation of the business climate in which our customers operate is based on a review of various publicly-available materials regarding our customers' industries, including the solvency of various companies in the industry.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nWe qualify as an emerging growth company under Section 109 of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups, ( JOBS\u201d) Act. An emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we have chosen to opt out\u201d of such extended transition period, and as a result, are compliant with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 108 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nFor more discussion on

Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, the notes thereto, and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. The following discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties. See Part I ( Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d) and Part I, Item 1A ( Risk Factors\u201d).\nOverview\nWe provide compression services in a number of shale plays throughout the U.S., including the Utica, Marcellus, Permian Basin, Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Mississippi Lime, Granite Wash, Woodford, Barnett, Haynesville, Niobrara and Fayetteville shales. The demand for our services is driven by the domestic production of natural gas and crude oil; as such, we have focused our activities in areas of attractive natural gas and crude oil production growth, which are generally found in these shale and unconventional resource plays. According to studies promulgated by the Energy Information Agency ( EIA\u201d), the production and transportation volumes in these shale plays are expected to increase over the long term due to the comparatively attractive economic returns versus returns achieved in many conventional basins. Furthermore, the changes in production volumes and pressures of shale plays over time require a wider range of compression services than in conventional basins. We believe the flexibility of our compression units positions us well to meet these changing operating conditions. While our business focuses largely on compression services serving infrastructure applications, including centralized natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities, which utilize large horsepower compression units, typically in shale plays, we also provide compression services in more mature conventional basins, including gas lift applications on crude oil wells targeted by horizontal drilling techniques. Gas lift, a process by which natural gas is injected into the production tubing of an existing producing well, thus reducing the hydrostatic pressure and allowing the oil to flow at a higher rate, and other artificial lift technologies are critical to the enhancement of oil production from horizontal wells operating in tight shale plays.\nGeneral Trends and Outlook\nWhile our business does not have direct exposure to commodity prices, the general activity levels of our customers can be affected by commodity prices. A significant amount of our assets are utilized in natural gas infrastructure applications, primarily in centralized natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities. Given the project nature of these applications and long-term investment horizon of our customers, we have generally experienced stability in rates and higher sustained utilization rates relative to other businesses more tied to drilling activity and wellhead economics. In addition to assets utilized in infrastructure applications, a small portion of our fleet is used in connection with crude oil production using horizontal drilling techniques.\nThe relative increase in, and stabilization of, commodity prices during the second-half of 2016 and throughout 2017 has allowed our customers to increase their capital budgets in regards to crude oil exploration and production activities and the build-out of large-scale natural gas infrastructure projects, particularly in areas with favorable economics. These projects increased demand for our compression services throughout 2017 as we saw our horsepower utilization increase from 87.1% at December 31, 2016 to 94.8% at December 31, 2017, while also increasing the horsepower in our fleet from 1,720,547 at December 31, 2016 to 1,799,781 at December 31, 2017.\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration January 2018 Short-Term Energy Outlook ( EIA Outlook\u201d) expects dry natural gas production to rise by 6.9 billion cubic feet per day ( Bcf/day\u201d) in 2018 and by 2.6 Bcf/day in 2019. If achieved, the forecasted 6.9 Bcf/day increase in 2018 would be the highest on record for any single year. The EIA Outlook expects growth to be concentrated in Appalachia's Marcellus and Utica regions, along with the Permian Basin region, all regions in which we provide compression services. Much of the expected increase in natural gas production is the result of increasing pipeline takeaway capacity out of the Marcellus and Utica producing regions to end-use markets. Additionally, EIA Outlook projects liquefied natural gas ( LNG\u201d) gross exports will average 3.0 Bcf/day in 2018, up from 1.9 Bcf/day in 2017. The EIA Outlook expects U.S. liquefaction capacity will continue to expand as several new projects are expected to enter service during 2018 and 2019. Also from the EIA Outlook, natural gas pipeline exports to Mexico through October increased by 0.4 Bcf/day in 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. A relatively low natural\ngas export price, rising demand from Mexico's power sector, and increased pipeline capacity in both the U.S. and Mexico have led to increased exports.\nWe believe this increasing demand for natural gas will also create increasing demand for compression services, for both existing natural gas fields as they age and for the development of new natural gas fields. As such, we expect demand for our compression services to continue to increase throughout 2018 although we cannot predict any possible changes in such demand with reasonable certainty.\nWe intend to prudently deploy capital for new compressor units in 2018. We have already entered into commitments to purchase most of our large horsepower compressor units in 2018, as the lead time to build these units is approximately one year or shorter. Most of our 2018 purchases of large horsepower compressor units are already committed to customers or under contract with customers due to the high demand and limited supply of these units.\nThe EIA Outlook forecasts total U.S. crude oil production to average 10.3 million barrels per day in 2018, up 1.0 million barrels per day from 2017. If achieved, forecasted 2018 production would be the highest annual average on record, surpassing the previous record of 9.6 million barrels per day set in 1970. According to the EIA Outlook, in 2019, crude oil production is forecast to rise to an average of 10.8 million barrels per day and the Permian region is expected to produce 3.6 million barrels per day of crude oil by the end of 2019 which would represent about 32% of U.S. crude oil production that year. With the large geographic area of the Permian region and stacked plays, the EIA Outlook estimates that operators can continue to develop multiple tight oil layers and increase production, even with sustained crude oil prices lower than $50 per barrel. As of February 8, 2018, the WTI crude oil spot price was $61.15 per barrel. WTI crude oil spot prices are forecast within the EIA Outlook to average $56 per barrel in 2018 and $57 per barrel in 2019. Daily and monthly average crude oil prices could vary significantly from annual average forecasts due to global economic developments and geopolitical events in the coming months that could have the potential to push oil prices higher or lower than forecast. Uncertainty remains regarding the duration of, and adherence to, the current Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC\u201d) production cuts, which could influence prices in either direction.\nWe believe the relative increase in, and stabilization of, crude oil prices in the second half of 2016 and throughout 2017 has led to an increase in drilling activity, and combined with the continued development of horizontal drilling technology, operators are able to produce new volumes of crude oil from tight, high pressure reservoirs. Due in part to these higher initial pressures, the increase in demand for gas lift compression in these new areas of drilling could be delayed until reservoir pressures decline to a point where compression is beneficial to the economics of a particular well or basin. However, we have experienced an increase in the demand for our smaller horsepower units engaged in gas lift applications and expect that to continue.\nOperating Highlights\nThe following table summarizes certain horsepower and horsepower utilization percentages for the periods presented.\n\n (1) Fleet horsepower is horsepower for compression units that have been delivered to us (and excludes units on order). As of December 31, 2017, we had 147,500 and 5,520 horsepower on order for delivery during 2018 and 2019, respectively. \n (2) Total available horsepower is revenue generating horsepower under contract for which we are billing a customer, horsepower in our fleet that is under contract but is not yet generating revenue, horsepower not yet in our fleet that is under contract but not yet generating revenue and that is subject to a purchase order, and idle horsepower. Total available horsepower excludes new horsepower on order for which we do not have a compression services contract. \n (3) Revenue generating horsepower is horsepower under contract for which we are billing a customer. \n (4) Calculated as the average of the month-end revenue generating horsepower for each of the months in the period. \n (5) Calculated as the average of the result of dividing the contractual monthly rate for all units at the end of each month in the period by the sum of the revenue generating horsepower at the end of each month in the period. \n (6) Calculated as the average of the month-end revenue generating horsepower per revenue generating compression unit for each of the months in the period. \n (7) Horsepower utilization is calculated as (i) the sum of (a) revenue generating horsepower, (b) horsepower in our fleet that is under contract but is not yet generating revenue, and (c) horsepower not yet in our fleet that is under contract, not yet generating revenue and that is subject to a purchase order, divided by (ii) total available horsepower less idle horsepower that is under repair. Horsepower utilization based on revenue generating horsepower and fleet horsepower was 90.3%, 80.6% and 83.2% at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \n (8) Calculated as the average utilization for the months in the period based on utilization at the end of each month in the period. Average horsepower utilization based on revenue generating horsepower and fleet horsepower was 85.9%, 80.3% and 85.1% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \nThe 4.6% increase in fleet horsepower as of December 31, 2017 over the fleet horsepower as of December 31, 2016 was attributable to new compression units added to our fleet to meet then expected demand by new and current customers for compression services. The 17.1% increase in revenue generating horsepower as of December 31, 2017 over December 31, 2016 was primarily due to organic growth in our active fleet and redeployment of previously idle equipment. The 3.7% increase in average horsepower per revenue generating compression unit as of December 31, 2017 over December 31, 2016 was primarily due to the addition of large horsepower compression units in the operating fleet. The 2.2% decrease in average revenue per revenue generating horsepower per month for the year ended December 31, 2017 over December 31, 2016 was primarily due to (1) reduced pricing in the small horsepower portion of our fleet in the current period and (2) an increase in the average horsepower per revenue generating compression unit in the current period, resulting from an increase in the number of large horsepower compression units which typically generate lower average revenue per revenue generating horsepower than do small horsepower compression units.\nThe 0.5% increase in fleet horsepower as of December 31, 2016 over the fleet horsepower as of December 31, 2015 was attributable to new compression units added to our fleet to meet then expected demand by new and current customers for compression services. The 2.6% decrease in revenue generating horsepower as of December 31, 2016 over December 31, 2015 was primarily due to an increase in the amount of time required to contract services for new compression units and an increase in the amount of compression units returned to us. The 3.3% increase in average horsepower per revenue generating compression unit as of December 31, 2016 over December 31, 2015 was primarily due to the addition of large horsepower compression units in the operating fleet and the decline in utilization of small horsepower units over the year ended December 31, 2016. The 3.1% decrease in average revenue per revenue generating horsepower per month for the year ended December 31, 2016 over December 31, 2015 was primarily due to (1) reduced pricing in the small horsepower portion of our fleet in the current period and (2) an increase in the average horsepower per revenue generating compression unit in the current period, resulting from an increase in the number of large horsepower compression units which typically generate lower average revenue per revenue generating horsepower than do small horsepower compression units.\nAverage horsepower utilization increased to 92.0% during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 87.4% during the year ended December 31, 2016. The 4.6% increase in average horsepower utilization was primarily attributable to the following changes as a percentage of total available horsepower: (1) a 6.9% increase in horsepower that is under contract but not yet generating revenue and (2) a 1.9% decrease in our average fleet of compression units returned to us not yet under contract, offset by (3) a 4.0% decrease in idle horsepower under repair, which is excluded from the average horsepower utilization calculation until such repair is complete. We believe the increase in average horsepower utilization is the result of increased demand for our services commensurate with increased operating activity in the oil and gas industry. The above noted fluctuation in utilization components also describes the changes in period end horsepower utilization as of December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016.\nAverage horsepower utilization decreased to 87.4% during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 90.5% during the year ended December 31, 2015. The 3.1% decrease in average horsepower utilization was primarily attributable to the following changes as a percentage of total available horsepower: (1) a 3.7% increase in our average fleet of compression units returned to us not yet under contract and (2) a 1.0% decrease in horsepower that was on-contract or pending-contract but not yet active. The decrease in average horsepower utilization was offset by a 2.6% increase in idle horsepower under repair, which is excluded from the average horsepower utilization calculation until such repair is complete. We believe the decrease in average horsepower utilization was the result of a delay in planned projects of certain of our customers, continued optimization of existing compression service requirements by our customers and our selective pursuit of what we deemed to be the most attractive opportunities. The above noted fluctuation in utilization components also describes the changes in period end horsepower utilization, except that we experienced a 1.2% increase in horsepower that was on-contract or pending-contract but not yet active as of December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015.\nAverage horsepower utilization based on revenue generating horsepower and fleet horsepower increased to 85.9% during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 80.3% during the year ended December 31, 2016. The 5.6% increase was primarily attributable to the following changes as a percentage of total fleet horsepower: (1) a 4.0% decrease in idle horsepower under repair and (2) a 2.0% decrease in our average idle fleet composed of new compression units offset by (3) a 0.4% increase in our average idle fleet from compression units returned to us. The overall decrease in idle horsepower is the result of increased demand for our services commensurate with increased operating activity in the oil and gas industry. These factors also describe the variances in period end horsepower utilization based on revenue generating horsepower and fleet horsepower between the year ended December 31, 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAverage horsepower utilization based on revenue generating horsepower and fleet horsepower decreased to 80.3% during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 85.1% during the year ended December 31, 2015. The 4.8% decrease was primarily attributable to the following changes as a percentage of total fleet horsepower: (1) a 4.7% increase in our average idle fleet from compression units returned to us and (2) a 2.6% increase in idle horsepower under repair offset by (3) a 2.4% decrease in our average idle fleet composed of new compression units. The increase in units returned to us is believed to be a result of our customers' optimization of their compression service requirements. These\nfactors also describe the variances in period end horsepower utilization based on revenue generating horsepower and fleet horsepower between the year ended December 31, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015.\nFinancial Results of Operations\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\n\nContract operations revenue. During 2017, we experienced a year-to-year increase in demand for our compression services driven by increased operating activity in natural gas and crude oil production, resulting in a $17.4 million increase in our contract operations revenue. Average revenue generating horsepower increased 9.3% during the year ended December 31, 2017 over December 31, 2016 while average revenue per revenue generating horsepower per month decreased from $15.41 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $15.07 for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of 2.2%, attributable, in part, to reduced pricing in the current period in the small horsepower portion of our fleet. The decrease in average revenue per revenue generating horsepower per month was also attributable to the 3.7% increase in the average horsepower per revenue generating compression unit in the current period, as large horsepower compression units typically generate lower average monthly revenue per revenue generating horsepower than do small horsepower compression units. Average revenue per revenue generating horsepower per month associated with our compression services provided on a month-to-month basis did not significantly differ from the average revenue per revenue generating horsepower per month associated with our compression services provided under contracts in the primary term. Our contract operations revenue was not materially impacted by any renegotiations of our contracts during the period with our customers.\nParts and service revenue. Parts and service revenue was earned primarily on the installation of equipment ancillary to compression operations. The $3.1 million decrease in parts and service revenue was primarily attributable to (1) an $8.3 million decrease in revenue associated with installation services offset by (2) a $4.1 million increase in maintenance work on units at our customers' locations that are outside the scope of our core maintenance activities and (3) a $1.4 million increase in freight and crane charges that are directly reimbursable by our customers. We offer these\nservices as a courtesy to our customers and the demand fluctuates from period to period based on the varying needs of our customers.\nCost of operations, exclusive of depreciation and amortization. The $4.4 million increase in cost of operations was primarily attributable to (1) a $7.4 million increase in direct expenses, such as parts and fluids expenses and (2) a $2.4 million increase in direct labor expenses offset by (3) a $3.5 million decrease in retail parts and service expenses, which have a corresponding decrease in parts and service revenue, and (4) a $2.7 million decrease in property and other taxes. The increase in direct parts, fluids and labor are primarily driven by the increase in average revenue generating horsepower during the current period.\nGross operating margin. The $9.9 million increase in gross operating margin was primarily due to an increase in revenues, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. The $3.0 million increase in selling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to (1) a $1.3 million increase in unit-based compensation expense, (2) a $0.8 million increase in bad debt expense, due to a $1.1 million recovery of bad debt expense during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to a $0.3 million recovery during the year ended December 31, 2017 and (3) $0.5 million increase in transaction expenses related to potential acquisitions. Unit-based compensation expense increased primarily due to a greater fair value assigned to the 2016 Performance Units\u201d that are subject to market criteria and which were measured using the Monte Carlo simulation model as of December 31, 2017.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. The $6.3 million increase in depreciation expense was primarily related to an increase in gross property and equipment balances during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to gross balances during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nLoss (gain) on disposition of assets. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the $0.5 million gain was primarily attributable to the sale of select compression equipment. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we abandoned certain assets and incurred a $1.0 million loss.\nImpairment of compression equipment. The $5.0 million and $5.8 million impairment charge during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, were primarily a result of our evaluation of the future deployment of our current idle fleet under the current market conditions. Our evaluation determined that due to certain performance characteristics of the impaired equipment, such as excessive maintenance costs and the inability of the equipment to meet then-current emission standards without retrofitting, this equipment was unlikely to be accepted by customers under then-current market conditions. As a result of our evaluation during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we determined to retire and either sell or re-utilize the key components of 40 and 29 compression units, with a total of approximately 11,000 and 15,000 horsepower, respectively, that had been previously used to provide compression services in our business.\nInterest expense, net. The $4.0 million increase in interest expense, net was primarily attributable to the impact of an increase in our weighted average interest rate. Our revolving credit facility bore an interest rate of 3.46% and 2.94% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and a weighted-average interest rate of 3.14% and 2.55% during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The impact of the increase in interest rate was partially offset by the impact of an $8.9 million decrease in average outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Average borrowings under the facility were $734.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $743.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nIncome tax expense. This line item represents the Revised Texas Franchise Tax ( Texas Margin Tax\u201d) and change in deferred tax liability, which is materially consistent between both periods.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\n\n* Not meaningful.\nContract operations revenue. During 2016, we experienced a year-to-year decrease in demand for our compression services driven by decreased operating activity in natural gas and crude oil production and continued optimization of existing compression service requirements, resulting in a 2.2% decrease in average revenue generating horsepower and a $16.9 million decrease in our contract operations revenue. Average revenue per revenue generating horsepower per month decreased from $15.90 for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $15.41 for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of 3.1%, attributable, in part, to reduced pricing in the current period in the small horsepower portion of our fleet. The decrease in average revenue per revenue generating horsepower per month was also attributable to the 3.3% increase in the average horsepower per revenue generating compression unit in the current period, as large horsepower compression units generally generate lower average monthly revenue per revenue generating horsepower than do small horsepower compression units. Average revenue per revenue generating horsepower per month associated with our compression services provided on a month-to-month basis was somewhat higher than the average revenue per revenue generating horsepower per month associated with our compression services provided under contracts in the primary term due to pressure on service rates attributable to the small horsepower portion of our fleet. Because the demand for our services is driven primarily by production of natural gas, we focus our activities in areas of attractive growth, which are generally found in certain shale and unconventional resource plays, as discussed above under the heading Overview.\u201d Our contract operations revenue was not materially impacted by any renegotiations of our contracts during the period with our customers.\nParts and service revenue. Parts and service revenue was earned primarily on the installation of equipment ancillary to compression operations. During 2016, we recognized $15.7 million of revenue associated with installation services, which accounts for the $12.2 million year-over-year increase in parts and service revenue. The remaining component of our parts and service revenue, which was earned primarily on (1) freight and crane charges that are directly reimbursed by our customers, for which we earn little to no margin, and (2) maintenance work on units at our customers' locations\nthat are outside the scope of our core maintenance activities, for which we earn lower margins than our contract operations, decreased $3.5 million during the current period.\nCost of operations, exclusive of depreciation and amortization. The $6.6 million increase in cost of operations was primarily attributable to an $8.3 million increase in retail parts and service expenses, which includes $11.9 million of additional costs associated with our installation services. Excluding these costs, retail parts and services expense decreased $3.6 million reflecting a corresponding decrease in this component of parts and services revenue. Additionally during the period, we experienced (1) a $2.1 million decrease in direct expenses, such as parts and fluids expenses, (2) a $0.6 million decrease in direct labor expenses and (3) a $0.5 million decrease in expenses related to our vehicle fleet, offset by (4) a $1.7 million increase in property and other taxes. The decrease in direct parts, fluids, labor and vehicle expenses are primarily driven by the decrease in average revenue generating horsepower during the current period.\nGross operating margin. The $11.2 million decrease in gross operating margin was primarily due to a decrease in revenues, partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses and the $3.8 million of gross operating margin we earned from our installation services during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. The $3.5 million increase in selling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to a $6.5 million increase in unit-based compensation expense, partially offset by a $2.9 million decrease in bad debt expense. Unit-based compensation expense increased primarily due to (1) the increase in our unit price as of December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015, (2) a greater number of outstanding phantom units as of December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 which resulted from a higher number of phantom unit grants during 2016 as compared to 2015 (reflecting our sharply lower unit price at the time the grants were made in 2016 versus our unit price at the time the grants were made in 2015), and (3) a greater number of phantom units outstanding on which distribution equivalent rights were paid as of each record date during the comparable periods. The decrease in bad debt expense was due primarily to a $1.1 million decrease in allowance for doubtful accounts during the year ended December 31, 2016 due in part to collections on accounts that had previously been reserved during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to a $1.8 million increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. The $7.1 million increase in depreciation expense was related to an increase in gross property and equipment balances during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to gross balances during the year ended December 31, 2015. There is no variance in amortization expense between the periods, as intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis and there has been no change in gross identifiable intangible assets between the periods.\nLoss (gain) on disposition of assets. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we abandoned certain assets and incurred a $1.0 million loss. The $1.0 million gain on sale of assets during the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to $1.2 million cash insurance recoveries on previously impaired compression equipment received during the year and $1.1 million gain on sale of 18 units, or 7,200 horsepower, offset by $1.3 million of losses incurred in the disposal of various unit and non-unit assets.\nImpairment of compression equipment. The $5.8 million and $27.3 million impairment charge during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were primarily a result of our evaluation of the future deployment of our current idle fleet under the current market conditions. Our evaluation determined that due to certain performance characteristics of the impaired equipment, such as excessive maintenance costs and the inability of the equipment to meet current emission standards without retrofitting, this equipment was unlikely to be accepted by customers under current market conditions. As a result of our evaluation during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we determined to retire and either sell or re-utilize the key components of 29 and 166 compression units, with a total of approximately 15,000 and 58,000 horsepower, respectively, that had been previously used to provide compression services in our business.\nGoodwill impairment. There was no impairment of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a $172.2 million impairment of goodwill due primarily to the decline in our unit\nprice, the sustained decline in global commodity prices, expected reduction in the capital budgets of certain of our customers and the impact these factors have on our expected future cash flows.\nInterest expense, net. The $3.5 million increase in interest expense, net was primarily attributable to the impact of an approximately $20.2 million increase in average outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility, in which average borrowings were $743.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $723.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our revolving credit facility had an interest rate of 2.94% and 2.26% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and a weighted-average interest rate of 2.55% and 2.24% during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nIncome tax expense. This line item represents the Texas Margin Tax. The decrease in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 was primarily associated with the establishment of a deferred tax liability reflecting the book/tax basis difference in our property and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOther Financial Data\nThe following table summarizes other financial data for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\n\n (1) Gross operating margin, Adjusted EBITDA, DCF, DCF Coverage Ratio and Cash Coverage Ratio are all non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions of each measure, as well as reconciliations of each measure to its most directly comparable financial measure(s) calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, can be found under the caption Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d in Part II, Item 6. \n (2) Gross operating margin percentage and Adjusted EBITDA percentage are calculated as a percentage of revenue. \n (3) Definitions of DCF and DCF Coverage Ratio can be found under the caption Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d in Part II, Item 6. The DCF and DCF Coverage Ratios presented here are based on a weighted average of units outstanding. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the DCF Coverage Ratio based on the actual units outstanding at the respective record dates was 0.98x and 1.15x, respectively, and the Cash Coverage Ratio based on actual units outstanding at the respective record dates for these same periods was 1.23x and 2.48x, respectively. \nAdjusted EBITDA. The $9.1 million, or 6.2%, increase in Adjusted EBITDA during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to a $9.9 million increase in gross operating margin offset by $0.9 million higher selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding unit-based compensation expense, severance charges and transaction expenses, during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe $6.9 million, or 4.5%, decrease in Adjusted EBITDA during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to an $11.2 million decrease in gross operating margin offset by $4.4 million lower selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding unit-based compensation expense, severance charges and transaction expenses, during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nDistributable Cash Flow. DCF during the year ended December 31, 2017 was materially consistent with DCF during the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to $9.9 million increase in gross operating margin, offset by $4.8 million higher maintenance capital expenditures, $4.0 million higher cash interest expense, net and $0.9 million\nhigher selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding unit-based compensation expense, severance charges and transaction expenses during the comparable period.\nThe $2.5 million, or 2.1%, decrease in DCF during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to $11.2 million decrease in gross operating margin, $3.1 million higher cash interest expense, net and $1.1 million lower insurance recoveries received, offset by $8.4 million lower maintenance capital expenditures, $4.4 million lower selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding unit-based compensation expense, severance charges and transaction expenses during the comparable period.\nCoverage Ratios. The decrease in DCF Coverage Ratio is due to a greater number of common units outstanding as of the respective record dates during the year ended December 31, 2017. The disproportionate decrease in Cash Coverage Ratio (as compared to DCF Coverage Ratio) is due to period-to-period decreases in DRIP participation.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nWe operate in a capital-intensive industry, and our primary liquidity needs are to finance the purchase of additional compression units and make other capital expenditures, service our debt, fund working capital, and pay distributions. Our principal sources of liquidity include cash generated by operating activities, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and issuances of debt and equity securities, including under the DRIP.\nWe believe cash generated by operating activities and, where necessary, borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to service our debt, fund working capital, fund our estimated expansion capital expenditures, fund our maintenance capital expenditures and pay distributions through 2018. Because we distribute all of our available cash, which excludes prudent operating reserves, we expect to fund any future expansion capital expenditures or acquisitions primarily with capital from external financing sources, such as borrowings under our revolving credit facility and issuances of debt and equity securities, including under the DRIP.\nIf the CDM Acquisition and other transactions described in Item 1 ( Business-Recent Developments\u201d) are consummated, our capital expenditure requirements may increase significantly. We expect to fund any increase in capital expenditures with cash generated by operating activities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nWe are not aware of any regulatory changes or environmental liabilities that we currently expect to have a material impact on our current or future operations. Please see -Capital Expenditures\u201d below.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities. The $20.9 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was due primarily to $9.9 million higher gross operating margin, adjustments to non-cash and other items and changes in our working capital.\nThe $13.7 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was due primarily to $11.2 million lower gross operating margin, adjustments to non-cash and other items and changes in our working capital.\nNet cash used in investing activities. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in investing activities related primarily to purchases of new compression units, reconfiguration costs and related equipment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash used in investing activities related primarily to purchases of new compression units, reconfiguration costs and related equipment. We significantly reduced our purchases of new compression units during 2016 due to the reduced activity levels in the overall energy market.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in investing activities related primarily to purchases of new compression units and related equipment in response to increased demand for our services and maintenance capital expenditures made to maintain or replace existing assets and operating capacity, partially offset by $1.7 million of proceeds from the disposition of equipment during 2015 and $1.2 million of proceeds from insurance recoveries on previously impaired compression units during 2015.\nNet cash provided by financing activities. During 2017, we borrowed $97.5 million, on a net basis, on our revolving credit facility from which we borrow primarily to support our purchases of new compression units, reconfiguration costs and related equipment, as described above. Additionally, we made cash distributions to our unitholders of $114.1 million and paid $2.8 million in cash related to the net settlement of unit-based awards.\nDuring 2016, we paid $43.8 million, on a net basis, on our revolving credit facility from which we borrow primarily to support our purchases of new compression units, reconfiguration costs and related equipment, as described above. During December 2016, we completed a public equity offering and utilized net proceeds of $80.9 million to reduce indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Additionally, we paid various loan fees and incurred costs of $2.0 million related to an amendment to our revolving credit facility. During 2016, we made cash distributions to our unitholders of $87.7 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we borrowed $134.3 million, on a net basis, primarily to support our purchases of new compression units and related equipment, as described above. During 2015, we completed a public equity offering and a private placement and utilized combined net proceeds of $75.1 million to reduce indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Additionally, in January 2015, we paid various loan fees and incurred costs of $3.4 million related to an amendment to our revolving credit facility. During 2015, we made cash distributions to our unitholders of $45.1 million.\nEquity Offerings\nOn December 8, 2016, we closed a public offering of 5,175,000 common units at a price to the public of $16.25 per common unit. We used the net proceeds of $80.9 million (net of underwriting discounts and commission and offering expenses) to reduce the indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility.\nOn September 15, 2015, we closed a public offering of 4,000,000 common units at a price to the public of $19.33 per common unit. We used the net proceeds of $74.4 million (net of underwriting discounts and commission and offering expenses) to reduce the indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility.\nOn May 21, 2015, we issued 34,921 common units in a private placement for $0.7 million in a transaction that was exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d). We used the proceeds from the private placement for general partnership purposes.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe compression services business is capital intensive, requiring significant investment to maintain, expand and upgrade existing operations. Our capital requirements have consisted primarily of, and we anticipate that our capital requirements will continue to consist primarily of, the following:\n \u00b7 maintenance capital expenditures, which are capital expenditures made to maintain the operating capacity of our assets and extend their useful lives, to replace partially or fully depreciated assets, or other capital expenditures that are incurred in maintaining our existing business and related operating income; and \n \u00b7 expansion capital expenditures, which are capital expenditures made to expand the operating capacity or operating income capacity of assets, including by acquisition of compression units or through modification of existing compression units to increase their capacity, or to replace certain partially or fully depreciated assets that were not currently generating operating income. \nWe classify capital expenditures as maintenance or expansion on an individual asset basis. Over the long term, we expect that our maintenance capital expenditure requirements will continue to increase as the overall size and age of our fleet increases. Our aggregate maintenance capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $12.6 million and $7.7 million, respectively. We currently plan to spend approximately $15 million in maintenance capital expenditures during 2018, including parts consumed from inventory.\nGiven our growth objectives and anticipated demand from our customers as a result of the increasing natural gas activity described above under the heading -General Trends and Outlook,\u201d we anticipate that we will continue to make significant expansion capital expenditures. Without giving effect to any equipment we may acquire pursuant to any current or future acquisitions, we currently have budgeted between $130 million and $140 million in expansion capital expenditures during 2018. Our expansion capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $116.9 million and $40.9 million, respectively.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nAs of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all of our covenants under our revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $782.9 million, $272.1 million of borrowing base availability and, subject to compliance with the applicable financial covenants, available borrowing capacity of $101.6 million. The borrowing base consists of eligible accounts receivable, inventory and compression units. One of the financial covenants under our revolving credit facility permits a maximum leverage ratio of (A) 5.25 to 1.0 as of the end of the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2017 and (B) 5.00 to 1.0 thereafter. As of February 8, 2018, we had outstanding borrowings of $815.0 million. We expect to remain in compliance with our covenants throughout 2018. If our current cash flow projections prove to be inaccurate, we expect to be able to remain in compliance with such financial covenants by one or more of the following actions: issue debt and equity securities in conjunction with the acquisition of another business; issue equity in a public or private offering; request a modification of our covenants from our bank group; reduce distributions from our current distribution rate or obtain an equity infusion pursuant to the terms of our revolving credit facility.\nFor a more detailed description of our revolving credit facility including the covenants and restrictions contained therein, please refer to Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.\nCommitment Letter\nIn connection with the CDM Acquisition, on January 15, 2018, we entered into a commitment letter with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Barclays Bank PLC, as modified by the joinder to commitment letter and bridge fee letter entered into by the Partnership, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Barclays Bank PLC with each of Regions Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., MUFG Union Bank, N.A., a member of MUFG, a global financial group, The Bank of Nova Scotia and SunTrust Bank and certain affiliates of such parties (the Commitment Letter\u201d). The Commitment Letter provides for senior unsecured bridge loans in an aggregate amount up to $725 million (the Bridge Loans\u201d). The proceeds of such Bridge Loans may be used (a) to finance a portion of the purchase price of the CDM Acquisition and (b) to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith. The availability of the borrowings is subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions.\nDistribution Reinvestment Plan\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, distributions of $20.3 million were reinvested under the DRIP resulting in the issuance of 1.2 million common units. Such distributions are treated as non-cash transactions in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included under Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nFor a more detailed description of the DRIP, please refer to Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements.\nTotal Contractual Cash Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our total contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2017:\n\n (1) We assumed that the amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2017 would be repaid in January 2020, the maturity date of the facility. \n (2) Represents future interest payments under our revolving credit facility based on the interest rate as of December 31, 2017 of 3.46%. \n (3) Represents commitments for new compression units that are being fabricated, and is a component of our overall projected expansion capital expenditures during 2018 of $130 million to $140 million. \n (4) Represents commitments for future minimum lease payments on noncancelable leases. \nEffects of Inflation. Our revenues and results of operations have not been materially impacted by inflation and changing prices in the past three fiscal years.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet financing activities. Please refer to Note 13 of our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a description of our commitments and contingencies.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements. These financial statements were prepared in conformity with GAAP. As such, we are required to make\ncertain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. We base our estimates on historical experience, available information and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates; however, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The accounting policies that we believe require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and are the most critical to its reporting of results of operations and financial position are as follows:\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue using the following criteria: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (iii) the customer's price is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.\nRevenue from compression services is recognized ratably under our fixed-fee contracts over the term of the contract as compression services are provided to our customers. Compression services generally are billed monthly, one month in advance of the commencement of the service month, except for certain customers who are billed at the beginning of the service month. Amounts invoiced in advance are recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet until earned, at which time it is recognized as revenue.\nRevenue and the associated expense from installation services, which includes the installation of stations for our customers, is recorded using the percentage-of-completion method measured using the efforts-expended method. In applying the percentage-of-completion method, we use the percentage of total workflows to date that have been completed relative to estimated total workflows to be completed in order to estimate the progress towards completion to determine the amount of revenue and profit to recognize for each contract.\nThe percentage-of-completion method of revenue recognition requires us to make estimates of contract revenues and costs to complete our projects. In making such estimates, management judgments are required to evaluate significant assumptions including the cost of materials and labor, expected labor productivity, the impact of potential variances in schedule completion, the amount of net contract revenues and the impact of any penalties, claims, change orders, or performance incentives.\nBusiness Combinations and Goodwill\nGoodwill acquired in connection with business combinations represents the excess of consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired. Certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment annually based on the carrying values as of October 1, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise that suggest the carrying value of goodwill may not be recovered.\nGoodwill-Impairment Assessments\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually on October 1 of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our single business reporting unit could be less than its carrying value (including goodwill). The timing of the annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods.\nWe estimate the fair value of our reporting unit based on a number of factors, including the potential value we would receive if we sold the reporting unit, enterprise value, discount rates and projected cash flows. Estimating projected cash flows requires us to make certain assumptions as it relates to future operating performance. When considering operating performance, various factors are considered such as current and changing economic conditions and the commodity price environment, among others. Due to the imprecise nature of these projections and assumptions, actual results can and often do, differ from our estimates. If the growth assumptions embodied in the current year impairment testing prove inaccurate, we could incur an impairment charge in the future.\nOn October 1, 2017 and 2016, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test, wherein we compared the estimated fair value of our single reporting unit to its carrying value. The estimated fair value of our reporting unit, measured based on market capitalization, as of October 1, 2017 and 2016 exceeded its carrying value in excess of 20% and we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired. We recorded no goodwill impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. We had approximately $35.9 million of goodwill recorded on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nOn October 1, 2015, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and concluded that our goodwill was not impaired. We updated our impairment test as of December 31, 2015 as certain potential impairment indicators were identified during the fourth quarter, specifically (1) the decline in the market price of our common units, (2) the sustained decline in global commodity prices, and (3) the decline in performance of the Alerian MLP Index, which indicated the reporting unit had a fair value that was less than its carrying value as of December 31, 2015. We prepared a quantitative assessment as of December 31, 2015 which indicated that the calculated fair value was less than the carrying value. We subsequently performed step two\u201d impairment test for our reporting unit under which we treated our business as if it had been acquired in a business combination as of December 31, 2015 and assigned the fair value of the reporting unit to all of our assets and liabilities. The carrying value of the goodwill was compared to the new implied fair value of goodwill and an impairment was recognized for the amount of the carrying value that exceeded the implied fair value. Based on that step two impairment test, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $172.2 million. We had approximately $35.9 of goodwill remaining on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 following this impairment.\nAs discussed above, estimates of fair value can be affected by a variety of external and internal factors. Volatility in crude oil prices can cause disruptions in global energy industries and markets. Potential events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the key assumptions we used in estimating the fair value of our reporting unit include the consolidation or failure of crude oil and natural gas producers, which may result in a smaller market for services and may cause us to lose key customers, and cost-cutting efforts by crude oil and natural gas producers,", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, the notes thereto, and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. The following discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties. See Part I ( Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d) and Part I, Item 1A ( Risk Factors\u201d).\nOverview\nWe provide compression services in a number of shale plays throughout the U.S., including the Utica, Marcellus, Permian Basin, Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Mississippi Lime, Granite Wash, Woodford, Barnett, Haynesville, Niobrara and Fayetteville shales. The demand for our services is driven by the domestic production of natural gas and crude oil; as such, we have focused our activities in areas of attractive natural gas and crude oil production growth, which are generally found in these shale and unconventional resource plays. According to studies promulgated by the Energy Information Agency ( EIA\u201d), the production and transportation volumes in these shale plays are expected to increase over the long term due to the comparatively attractive economic returns versus returns achieved in many conventional basins. Furthermore, the changes in production volumes and pressures of shale plays over time require a wider range of compression services than in conventional basins. We believe the flexibility of our compression units positions us well to meet these changing operating conditions. While our business focuses largely on compression services serving infrastructure applications, including centralized natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities, which utilize large horsepower compression units, typically in shale plays, we also provide compression services in more mature conventional basins, including gas lift applications on crude oil wells targeted by horizontal drilling techniques. Gas lift, a process by which natural gas is injected into the production tubing of an existing producing well, thus reducing the hydrostatic pressure and allowing the oil to flow at a higher rate, and other artificial lift technologies are critical to the enhancement of oil production from horizontal wells operating in tight shale plays.\nGeneral Trends and Outlook\nWhile our business does not have direct exposure to commodity prices, the general activity levels of our customers can be affected by commodity prices. A significant amount of our assets are utilized in natural gas infrastructure applications, primarily in centralized natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities. Given the project nature of these applications and long-term investment horizon of our customers, we have generally experienced stability in rates and higher sustained utilization rates relative to other businesses more tied to drilling activity and wellhead economics. In addition to assets utilized in infrastructure applications, a small portion of our fleet is used in connection with crude oil production using horizontal drilling techniques.\nThe relative increase in, and stabilization of, commodity prices during the second-half of 2016 and throughout 2017 has allowed our customers to increase their capital budgets in regards to crude oil exploration and production activities and the build-out of large-scale natural gas infrastructure projects, particularly in areas with favorable economics. These projects increased demand for our compression services throughout 2017 as we saw our horsepower utilization increase from 87.1% at December 31, 2016 to 94.8% at December 31, 2017, while also increasing the horsepower in our fleet from 1,720,547 at December 31, 2016 to 1,799,781 at December 31, 2017.\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration January 2018 Short-Term Energy Outlook ( EIA Outlook\u201d) expects dry natural gas production to rise by 6.9 billion cubic feet per day ( Bcf/day\u201d) in 2018 and by 2.6 Bcf/day in 2019. If achieved, the forecasted 6.9 Bcf/day increase in 2018 would be the highest on record for any single year. The EIA Outlook expects growth to be concentrated in Appalachia's Marcellus and Utica regions, along with the Permian Basin region, all regions in which we provide compression services. Much of the expected increase in natural gas production is the result of increasing pipeline takeaway capacity out of the Marcellus and Utica producing regions to end-use markets. Additionally, EIA Outlook projects liquefied natural gas ( LNG\u201d) gross exports will average 3.0 Bcf/day in 2018, up from 1.9 Bcf/day in 2017. The EIA Outlook expects U.S. liquefaction capacity will continue to expand as several new projects are expected to enter service during 2018 and 2019. Also from the EIA Outlook, natural gas pipeline exports to Mexico through October increased by 0.4 Bcf/day in 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. A relatively low natural\ngas export price, rising demand from Mexico's power sector, and increased pipeline capacity in both the U.S. and Mexico have led to increased exports.\nWe believe this increasing demand for natural gas will also create increasing demand for compression services, for both existing natural gas fields as they age and for the development of new natural gas fields. As such, we expect demand for our compression services to continue to increase throughout 2018 although we cannot predict any possible changes in such demand with reasonable certainty.\nWe intend to prudently deploy capital for new compressor units in 2018. We have already entered into commitments to purchase most of our large horsepower compressor units in 2018, as the lead time to build these units is approximately one year or shorter. Most of our 2018 purchases of large horsepower compressor units are already committed to customers or under contract with customers due to the high demand and limited supply of these units.\nThe EIA Outlook forecasts total U.S. crude oil production to average 10.3 million barrels per day in 2018, up 1.0 million barrels per day from 2017. If achieved, forecasted 2018 production would be the highest annual average on record, surpassing the previous record of 9.6 million barrels per day set in 1970. According to the EIA Outlook, in 2019, crude oil production is forecast to rise to an average of 10.8 million barrels per day and the Permian region is expected to produce 3.6 million barrels per day of crude oil by the end of 2019 which would represent about 32% of U.S. crude oil production that year. With the large geographic area of the Permian region and stacked plays, the EIA Outlook estimates that operators can continue to develop multiple tight oil layers and increase production, even with sustained crude oil prices lower than $50 per barrel. As of February 8, 2018, the WTI crude oil spot price was $61.15 per barrel. WTI crude oil spot prices are forecast within the EIA Outlook to average $56 per barrel in 2018 and $57 per barrel in 2019. Daily and monthly average crude oil prices could vary significantly from annual average forecasts due to global economic developments and geopolitical events in the coming months that could have the potential to push oil prices higher or lower than forecast. Uncertainty remains regarding the duration of, and adherence to, the current Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC\u201d) production cuts, which could influence prices in either direction.\nWe believe the relative increase in, and stabilization of, crude oil prices in the second half of 2016 and throughout 2017 has led to an increase in drilling activity, and combined with the continued development of horizontal drilling technology, operators are able to produce new volumes of crude oil from tight, high pressure reservoirs. Due in part to these higher initial pressures, the increase in demand for gas lift compression in these new areas of drilling could be delayed until reservoir pressures decline to a point where compression is beneficial to the economics of a particular well or basin. However, we have experienced an increase in the demand for our smaller horsepower units engaged in gas lift applications and expect that to continue.\nOperating Highlights\nThe following table summarizes certain horsepower and horsepower utilization percentages for the periods presented.\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercent Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating Data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFleet horsepower (at period end) (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,799,781 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,720,547 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,712,196 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.6\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n0.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal available horsepower (at period end) (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,950,301 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,730,547 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,712,196 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n1.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRevenue generating horsepower (at period end) (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,624,377 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,387,073 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,424,537 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(2.6)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAverage revenue generating horsepower (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,505,657 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,377,966 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,408,689 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(2.2)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAverage revenue per revenue generating horsepower per month (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n15.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n15.41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n15.90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.2)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(3.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRevenue generating compression units (at period end)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(6.8)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAverage horsepower per revenue generating compression unit (6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n3.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nHorsepower utilization (7):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAt period end\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n94.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n87.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n89.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n8.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(2.4)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAverage for the period (8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n92.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n87.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n90.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n5.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(3.4)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Fleet horsepower is horsepower for compression units that have been delivered to us (and excludes units on order). As of December 31, 2017, we had 147,500 and 5,520 horsepower on order for delivery during 2018 and 2019, respectively. \n (2) Total available horsepower is revenue generating horsepower under contract for which we are billing a customer, horsepower in our fleet that is under contract but is not yet generating revenue, horsepower not yet in our fleet that is under contract but not yet generating revenue and that is subject to a purchase order, and idle horsepower. Total available horsepower excludes new horsepower on order for which we do not have a compression services contract. \n (3) Revenue generating horsepower is horsepower under contract for which we are billing a customer. \n (4) Calculated as the average of the month-end revenue generating horsepower for each of the months in the period. \n (5) Calculated as the average of the result of dividing the contractual monthly rate for all units at the end of each month in the period by the sum of the revenue generating horsepower at the end of each month in the period. \n (6) Calculated as the average of the month-end revenue generating horsepower per revenue generating compression unit for each of the months in the period. \n (7) Horsepower utilization is calculated as (i) the sum of (a) revenue generating horsepower, (b) horsepower in our fleet that is under contract but is not yet generating revenue, and (c) horsepower not yet in our fleet that is under contract, not yet generating revenue and that is subject to a purchase order, divided by (ii) total available horsepower less idle horsepower that is under repair. Horsepower utilization based on revenue generating horsepower and fleet horsepower was 90.3%, 80.6% and 83.2% at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \n (8) Calculated as the average utilization for the months in the period based on utilization at the end of each month in the period. Average horsepower utilization based on revenue generating horsepower and fleet horsepower was 85.9%, 80.3% and 85.1% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \nThe 4.6% increase in fleet horsepower as of December 31, 2017 over the fleet horsepower as of December 31, 2016 was attributable to new compression units added to our fleet to meet then expected demand by new and current customers for compression services. The 17.1% increase in revenue generating horsepower as of December 31, 2017 over December 31, 2016 was primarily due to organic growth in our active fleet and redeployment of previously idle equipment. The 3.7% increase in average horsepower per revenue generating compression unit as of December 31, 2017 over December 31, 2016 was primarily due to the addition of large horsepower compression units in the operating fleet. The 2.2% decrease in average revenue per revenue generating horsepower per month for the year ended December 31, 2017 over December 31, 2016 was primarily due to (1) reduced pricing in the small horsepower portion of our fleet in the current period and (2) an increase in the average horsepower per revenue generating compression unit in the current period, resulting from an increase in the number of large horsepower compression units which typically generate lower average revenue per revenue generating horsepower than do small horsepower compression units.\nThe 0.5% increase in fleet horsepower as of December 31, 2016 over the fleet horsepower as of December 31, 2015 was attributable to new compression units added to our fleet to meet then expected demand by new and current customers for compression services. The 2.6% decrease in revenue generating horsepower as of December 31, 2016 over December 31, 2015 was primarily due to an increase in the amount of time required to contract services for new compression units and an increase in the amount of compression units returned to us. The 3.3% increase in average horsepower per revenue generating compression unit as of December 31, 2016 over December 31, 2015 was primarily due to the addition of large horsepower compression units in the operating fleet and the decline in utilization of small horsepower units over the year ended December 31, 2016. The 3.1% decrease in average revenue per revenue generating horsepower per month for the year ended December 31, 2016 over December 31, 2015 was primarily due to (1) reduced pricing in the small horsepower portion of our fleet in the current period and (2) an increase in the average horsepower per revenue generating compression unit in the current period, resulting from an increase in the number of large horsepower compression units which typically generate lower average revenue per revenue generating horsepower than do small horsepower compression units.\nAverage horsepower utilization increased to 92.0% during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 87.4% during the year ended December 31, 2016. The 4.6% increase in average horsepower utilization was primarily attributable to the following changes as a percentage of total available horsepower: (1) a 6.9% increase in horsepower that is under contract but not yet generating revenue and (2) a 1.9% decrease in our average fleet of compression units returned to us not yet under contract, offset by (3) a 4.0% decrease in idle horsepower under repair, which is excluded from the average horsepower utilization calculation until such repair is complete. We believe the increase in average horsepower utilization is the result of increased demand for our services commensurate with increased operating activity in the oil and gas industry. The above noted fluctuation in utilization components also describes the changes in period end horsepower utilization as of December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016.\nAverage horsepower utilization decreased to 87.4% during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 90.5% during the year ended December 31, 2015. The 3.1% decrease in average horsepower utilization was primarily attributable to the following changes as a percentage of total available horsepower: (1) a 3.7% increase in our average fleet of compression units returned to us not yet under contract and (2) a 1.0% decrease in horsepower that was on-contract or pending-contract but not yet active. The decrease in average horsepower utilization was offset by a 2.6% increase in idle horsepower under repair, which is excluded from the average horsepower utilization calculation until such repair is complete. We believe the decrease in average horsepower utilization was the result of a delay in planned projects of certain of our customers, continued optimization of existing compression service requirements by our customers and our selective pursuit of what we deemed to be the most attractive opportunities. The above noted fluctuation in utilization components also describes the changes in period end horsepower utilization, except that we experienced a 1.2% increase in horsepower that was on-contract or pending-contract but not yet active as of December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015.\nAverage horsepower utilization based on revenue generating horsepower and fleet horsepower increased to 85.9% during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 80.3% during the year ended December 31, 2016. The 5.6% increase was primarily attributable to the following changes as a percentage of total fleet horsepower: (1) a 4.0% decrease in idle horsepower under repair and (2) a 2.0% decrease in our average idle fleet composed of new compression units offset by (3) a 0.4% increase in our average idle fleet from compression units returned to us. The overall decrease in idle horsepower is the result of increased demand for our services commensurate with increased operating activity in the oil and gas industry. These factors also describe the variances in period end horsepower utilization based on revenue generating horsepower and fleet horsepower between the year ended December 31, 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAverage horsepower utilization based on revenue generating horsepower and fleet horsepower decreased to 80.3% during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 85.1% during the year ended December 31, 2015. The 4.8% decrease was primarily attributable to the following changes as a percentage of total fleet horsepower: (1) a 4.7% increase in our average idle fleet from compression units returned to us and (2) a 2.6% increase in idle horsepower under repair offset by (3) a 2.4% decrease in our average idle fleet composed of new compression units. The increase in units returned to us is believed to be a result of our customers' optimization of their compression service requirements. These\nfactors also describe the variances in period end horsepower utilization based on revenue generating horsepower and fleet horsepower between the year ended December 31, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015.\nFinancial Results of Operations\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods

During 2017, we experienced a year-to-year increase in demand for our compression services driven by increased operating activity in natural gas and crude oil production, resulting in a $17.4 million increase in our contract operations revenue. Average revenue generating horsepower increased 9.3% during the year ended December 31, 2017 over December 31, 2016 while average revenue per revenue generating horsepower per month decreased from $15.41 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $15.07 for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of 2.2%, attributable, in part, to reduced pricing in the current period in the small horsepower portion of our fleet. The decrease in average revenue per revenue generating horsepower per month was also attributable to the 3.7% increase in the average horsepower per revenue generating compression unit in the current period, as large horsepower compression units typically generate lower average monthly revenue per revenue generating horsepower than do small horsepower compression units. Average revenue per revenue generating horsepower per month associated with our compression services provided on a month-to-month basis did not significantly differ from the average revenue per revenue generating horsepower per month associated with our compression services provided under contracts in the primary term. Our contract operations revenue was not materially impacted by any renegotiations of our contracts during the period with our customers.\nParts and service revenue. Parts and service revenue was earned primarily on the installation of equipment ancillary to compression operations. The $3.1 million decrease in parts and service revenue was primarily attributable to (1) an $8.3 million decrease in revenue associated with installation services offset by (2) a $4.1 million increase in maintenance work on units at our customers' locations that are outside the scope of our core maintenance activities and (3) a $1.4 million increase in freight and crane charges that are directly reimbursable by our customers. We offer these\nservices as a courtesy to our customers and the demand fluctuates from period to period based on the varying needs of our customers.\nCost of operations, exclusive of depreciation and amortization. The $4.4 million increase in cost of operations was primarily attributable to (1) a $7.4 million increase in direct expenses, such as parts and fluids expenses and (2) a $2.4 million increase in direct labor expenses offset by (3) a $3.5 million decrease in retail parts and service expenses, which have a corresponding decrease in parts and service revenue, and (4) a $2.7 million decrease in property and other taxes. The increase in direct parts, fluids and labor are primarily driven by the increase in average revenue generating horsepower during the current period.\nGross operating margin. The $9.9 million increase in gross operating margin was primarily due to an increase in revenues, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. The $3.0 million increase in selling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to (1) a $1.3 million increase in unit-based compensation expense, (2) a $0.8 million increase in bad debt expense, due to a $1.1 million recovery of bad debt expense during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to a $0.3 million recovery during the year ended December 31, 2017 and (3) $0.5 million increase in transaction expenses related to potential acquisitions. Unit-based compensation expense increased primarily due to a greater fair value assigned to the 2016 Performance Units\u201d that are subject to market criteria and which were measured using the Monte Carlo simulation model as of December 31, 2017.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. The $6.3 million increase in depreciation expense was primarily related to an increase in gross property and equipment balances during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to gross balances during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nLoss (gain) on disposition of assets. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the $0.5 million gain was primarily attributable to the sale of select compression equipment. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we abandoned certain assets and incurred a $1.0 million loss.\nImpairment of compression equipment. The $5.0 million and $5.8 million impairment charge during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, were primarily a result of our evaluation of the future deployment of our current idle fleet under the current market conditions. Our evaluation determined that due to certain performance characteristics of the impaired equipment, such as excessive maintenance costs and the inability of the equipment to meet then-current emission standards without retrofitting, this equipment was unlikely to be accepted by customers under then-current market conditions. As a result of our evaluation during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we determined to retire and either sell or re-utilize the key components of 40 and 29 compression units, with a total of approximately 11,000 and 15,000 horsepower, respectively, that had been previously used to provide compression services in our business.\nInterest expense, net. The $4.0 million increase in interest expense, net was primarily attributable to the impact of an increase in our weighted average interest rate. Our revolving credit facility bore an interest rate of 3.46% and 2.94% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and a weighted-average interest rate of 3.14% and 2.55% during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The impact of the increase in interest rate was partially offset by the impact of an $8.9 million decrease in average outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Average borrowings under the facility were $734.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $743.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nIncome tax expense. This line item represents the Revised Texas Franchise Tax ( Texas Margin Tax\u201d) and change in deferred tax liability, which is materially consistent between both periods.\nYear ended December 31,

During 2016, we experienced a year-to-year decrease in demand for our compression services driven by decreased operating activity in natural gas and crude oil production and continued optimization of existing compression service requirements, resulting in a 2.2% decrease in average revenue generating horsepower and a $16.9 million decrease in our contract operations revenue. Average revenue per revenue generating horsepower per month decreased from $15.90 for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $15.41 for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of 3.1%, attributable, in part, to reduced pricing in the current period in the small horsepower portion of our fleet. The decrease in average revenue per revenue generating horsepower per month was also attributable to the 3.3% increase in the average horsepower per revenue generating compression unit in the current period, as large horsepower compression units generally generate lower average monthly revenue per revenue generating horsepower than do small horsepower compression units. Average revenue per revenue generating horsepower per month associated with our compression services provided on a month-to-month basis was somewhat higher than the average revenue per revenue generating horsepower per month associated with our compression services provided under contracts in the primary term due to pressure on service rates attributable to the small horsepower portion of our fleet. Because the demand for our services is driven primarily by production of natural gas, we focus our activities in areas of attractive growth, which are generally found in certain shale and unconventional resource plays, as discussed above under the heading Overview.\u201d Our contract operations revenue was not materially impacted by any renegotiations of our contracts during the period with our customers.\nParts and service revenue. Parts and service revenue was earned primarily on the installation of equipment ancillary to compression operations. During 2016, we recognized $15.7 million of revenue associated with installation services, which accounts for the $12.2 million year-over-year increase in parts and service revenue. The remaining component of our parts and service revenue, which was earned primarily on (1) freight and crane charges that are directly reimbursed by our customers, for which we earn little to no margin, and (2) maintenance work on units at our customers' locations\nthat are outside the scope of our core maintenance activities, for which we earn lower margins than our contract operations, decreased $3.5 million during the current period.\nCost of operations, exclusive of depreciation and amortization. The $6.6 million increase in cost of operations was primarily attributable to an $8.3 million increase in retail parts and service expenses, which includes $11.9 million of additional costs associated with our installation services. Excluding these costs, retail parts and services expense decreased $3.6 million reflecting a corresponding decrease in this component of parts and services revenue. Additionally during the period, we experienced (1) a $2.1 million decrease in direct expenses, such as parts and fluids expenses, (2) a $0.6 million decrease in direct labor expenses and (3) a $0.5 million decrease in expenses related to our vehicle fleet, offset by (4) a $1.7 million increase in property and other taxes. The decrease in direct parts, fluids, labor and vehicle expenses are primarily driven by the decrease in average revenue generating horsepower during the current period.\nGross operating margin. The $11.2 million decrease in gross operating margin was primarily due to a decrease in revenues, partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses and the $3.8 million of gross operating margin we earned from our installation services during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. The $3.5 million increase in selling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to a $6.5 million increase in unit-based compensation expense, partially offset by a $2.9 million decrease in bad debt expense. Unit-based compensation expense increased primarily due to (1) the increase in our unit price as of December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015, (2) a greater number of outstanding phantom units as of December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 which resulted from a higher number of phantom unit grants during 2016 as compared to 2015 (reflecting our sharply lower unit price at the time the grants were made in 2016 versus our unit price at the time the grants were made in 2015), and (3) a greater number of phantom units outstanding on which distribution equivalent rights were paid as of each record date during the comparable periods. The decrease in bad debt expense was due primarily to a $1.1 million decrease in allowance for doubtful accounts during the year ended December 31, 2016 due in part to collections on accounts that had previously been reserved during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to a $1.8 million increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. The $7.1 million increase in depreciation expense was related to an increase in gross property and equipment balances during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to gross balances during the year ended December 31, 2015. There is no variance in amortization expense between the periods, as intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis and there has been no change in gross identifiable intangible assets between the periods.\nLoss (gain) on disposition of assets. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we abandoned certain assets and incurred a $1.0 million loss. The $1.0 million gain on sale of assets during the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to $1.2 million cash insurance recoveries on previously impaired compression equipment received during the year and $1.1 million gain on sale of 18 units, or 7,200 horsepower, offset by $1.3 million of losses incurred in the disposal of various unit and non-unit assets.\nImpairment of compression equipment. The $5.8 million and $27.3 million impairment charge during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were primarily a result of our evaluation of the future deployment of our current idle fleet under the current market conditions. Our evaluation determined that due to certain performance characteristics of the impaired equipment, such as excessive maintenance costs and the inability of the equipment to meet current emission standards without retrofitting, this equipment was unlikely to be accepted by customers under current market conditions. As a result of our evaluation during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we determined to retire and either sell or re-utilize the key components of 29 and 166 compression units, with a total of approximately 15,000 and 58,000 horsepower, respectively, that had been previously used to provide compression services in our business.\nGoodwill impairment. There was no impairment of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a $172.2 million impairment of goodwill due primarily to the decline in our unit\nprice, the sustained decline in global commodity prices, expected reduction in the capital budgets of certain of our customers and the impact these factors have on our expected future cash flows.\nInterest expense, net. The $3.5 million increase in interest expense, net was primarily attributable to the impact of an approximately $20.2 million increase in average outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility, in which average borrowings were $743.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $723.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our revolving credit facility had an interest rate of 2.94% and 2.26% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and a weighted-average interest rate of 2.55% and 2.24% during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nIncome tax expense. This line item represents the Texas Margin Tax. The decrease in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 was primarily associated with the establishment of a deferred tax liability reflecting the book/tax basis difference in our property and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOther Financial Data\nThe following table summarizes other financial data for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercent Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther Financial Data: (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross operating margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n187,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n177,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n189,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.6\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(6.0)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross operating margin percentage (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n67.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n66.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n69.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n0.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(4.4)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n155,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n146,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n153,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(4.5)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdjusted EBITDA percentage (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n55.6\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n55.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n56.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n0.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(2.8)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDCF (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n118,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n118,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n120,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(2.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDCF Coverage Ratio (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.89\n</td> <td>\nx\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.00\n</td> <td>\nx\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(11.0)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(14.5)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash Coverage Ratio (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.02\n</td> <td>\nx\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.26\n</td> <td>\nx\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(19.0)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(51.2)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Gross operating margin, Adjusted EBITDA, DCF, DCF Coverage Ratio and Cash Coverage Ratio are all non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions of each measure, as well as reconciliations of each measure to its most directly comparable financial measure(s) calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, can be found under the caption Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d in Part II, Item 6. \n (2) Gross operating margin percentage and Adjusted EBITDA percentage are calculated as a percentage of revenue. \n (3) Definitions of DCF and DCF Coverage Ratio can be found under the caption Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d in Part II, Item 6. The DCF and DCF Coverage Ratios presented here are based on a weighted average of units outstanding. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the DCF Coverage Ratio based on the actual units outstanding at the respective record dates was 0.98x and 1.15x, respectively, and the Cash Coverage Ratio based on actual units outstanding at the respective record dates for these same periods was 1.23x and 2.48x, respectively. \nAdjusted EBITDA. The $9.1 million, or 6.2%, increase in Adjusted EBITDA during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to a $9.9 million increase in gross operating margin offset by $0.9 million higher selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding unit-based compensation expense, severance charges and transaction expenses, during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe $6.9 million, or 4.5%, decrease in Adjusted EBITDA during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to an $11.2 million decrease in gross operating margin offset by $4.4 million lower selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding unit-based compensation expense, severance charges and transaction expenses, during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nDistributable Cash Flow. DCF during the year ended December 31, 2017 was materially consistent with DCF during the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to $9.9 million increase in gross operating margin, offset by $4.8 million higher maintenance capital expenditures, $4.0 million higher cash interest expense, net and $0.9 million\nhigher selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding unit-based compensation expense, severance charges and transaction expenses during the comparable period.\nThe $2.5 million, or 2.1%, decrease in DCF during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to $11.2 million decrease in gross operating margin, $3.1 million higher cash interest expense, net and $1.1 million lower insurance recoveries received, offset by $8.4 million lower maintenance capital expenditures, $4.4 million lower selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding unit-based compensation expense, severance charges and transaction expenses during the comparable period.\nCoverage Ratios. The decrease in DCF Coverage Ratio is due to a greater number of common units outstanding as of the respective record dates during the year ended December 31, 2017. The disproportionate decrease in Cash Coverage Ratio (as compared to DCF Coverage Ratio) is due to period-to-period decreases in DRIP participation.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nWe operate in a capital-intensive industry, and our primary liquidity needs are to finance the purchase of additional compression units and make other capital expenditures, service our debt, fund working capital, and pay distributions. Our principal sources of liquidity include cash generated by operating activities, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and issuances of debt and equity securities, including under the DRIP.\nWe believe cash generated by operating activities and, where necessary, borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to service our debt, fund working capital, fund our estimated expansion capital expenditures, fund our maintenance capital expenditures and pay distributions through 2018. Because we distribute all of our available cash, which excludes prudent operating reserves, we expect to fund any future expansion capital expenditures or acquisitions primarily with capital from external financing sources, such as borrowings under our revolving credit facility and issuances of debt and equity securities, including under the DRIP.\nIf the CDM Acquisition and other transactions described in Item 1 ( Business-Recent Developments\u201d) are consummated, our capital expenditure requirements may increase significantly. We expect to fund any increase in capital expenditures with cash generated by operating activities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nWe are not aware of any regulatory changes or environmental liabilities that we currently expect to have a material impact on our current or future operations. Please see -Capital Expenditures\u201d below.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n124,644 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n103,697 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n117,401 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(105,231)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(50,831)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(278,158)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(19,431)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(52,808)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n160,758\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities. The $20.9 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was due primarily to $9.9 million higher gross operating margin, adjustments to non-cash and other items and changes in our working capital.\nThe $13.7 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was due primarily to $11.2 million lower gross operating margin, adjustments to non-cash and other items and changes in our working capital.\nNet cash used in investing activities. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in investing activities related primarily to purchases of new compression units, reconfiguration costs and related equipment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash used in investing activities related primarily to purchases of new compression units, reconfiguration costs and related equipment. We significantly reduced our purchases of new compression units during 2016 due to the reduced activity levels in the overall energy market.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in investing activities related primarily to purchases of new compression units and related equipment in response to increased demand for our services and maintenance capital expenditures made to maintain or replace existing assets and operating capacity, partially offset by $1.7 million of proceeds from the disposition of equipment during 2015 and $1.2 million of proceeds from insurance recoveries on previously impaired compression units during 2015.\nNet cash provided by financing activities. During 2017, we borrowed $97.5 million, on a net basis, on our revolving credit facility from which we borrow primarily to support our purchases of new compression units, reconfiguration costs and related equipment, as described above. Additionally, we made cash distributions to our unitholders of $114.1 million and paid $2.8 million in cash related to the net settlement of unit-based awards.\nDuring 2016, we paid $43.8 million, on a net basis, on our revolving credit facility from which we borrow primarily to support our purchases of new compression units, reconfiguration costs and related equipment, as described above. During December 2016, we completed a public equity offering and utilized net proceeds of $80.9 million to reduce indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Additionally, we paid various loan fees and incurred costs of $2.0 million related to an amendment to our revolving credit facility. During 2016, we made cash distributions to our unitholders of $87.7 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we borrowed $134.3 million, on a net basis, primarily to support our purchases of new compression units and related equipment, as described above. During 2015, we completed a public equity offering and a private placement and utilized combined net proceeds of $75.1 million to reduce indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Additionally, in January 2015, we paid various loan fees and incurred costs of $3.4 million related to an amendment to our revolving credit facility. During 2015, we made cash distributions to our unitholders of $45.1 million.\nEquity Offerings\nOn December 8, 2016, we closed a public offering of 5,175,000 common units at a price to the public of $16.25 per common unit. We used the net proceeds of $80.9 million (net of underwriting discounts and commission and offering expenses) to reduce the indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility.\nOn September 15, 2015, we closed a public offering of 4,000,000 common units at a price to the public of $19.33 per common unit. We used the net proceeds of $74.4 million (net of underwriting discounts and commission and offering expenses) to reduce the indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility.\nOn May 21, 2015, we issued 34,921 common units in a private placement for $0.7 million in a transaction that was exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d). We used the proceeds from the private placement for general partnership purposes.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe compression services business is capital intensive, requiring significant investment to maintain, expand and upgrade existing operations. Our capital requirements have consisted primarily of, and we anticipate that our capital requirements will continue to consist primarily of, the following:\n \u00b7 maintenance capital expenditures, which are capital expenditures made to maintain the operating capacity of our assets and extend their useful lives, to replace partially or fully depreciated assets, or other capital expenditures that are incurred in maintaining our existing business and related operating income; and \n \u00b7 expansion capital expenditures, which are capital expenditures made to expand the operating capacity or operating income capacity of assets, including by acquisition of compression units or through modification of existing compression units to increase their capacity, or to replace certain partially or fully depreciated assets that were not currently generating operating income. \nWe classify capital expenditures as maintenance or expansion on an individual asset basis. Over the long term, we expect that our maintenance capital expenditure requirements will continue to increase as the overall size and age of our fleet increases. Our aggregate maintenance capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $12.6 million and $7.7 million, respectively. We currently plan to spend approximately $15 million in maintenance capital expenditures during 2018, including parts consumed from inventory.\nGiven our growth objectives and anticipated demand from our customers as a result of the increasing natural gas activity described above under the heading -General Trends and Outlook,\u201d we anticipate that we will continue to make significant expansion capital expenditures. Without giving effect to any equipment we may acquire pursuant to any current or future acquisitions, we currently have budgeted between $130 million and $140 million in expansion capital expenditures during 2018. Our expansion capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $116.9 million and $40.9 million, respectively.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nAs of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all of our covenants under our revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $782.9 million, $272.1 million of borrowing base availability and, subject to compliance with the applicable financial covenants, available borrowing capacity of $101.6 million. The borrowing base consists of eligible accounts receivable, inventory and compression units. One of the financial covenants under our revolving credit facility permits a maximum leverage ratio of (A) 5.25 to 1.0 as of the end of the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2017 and (B) 5.00 to 1.0 thereafter. As of February 8, 2018, we had outstanding borrowings of $815.0 million. We expect to remain in compliance with our covenants throughout 2018. If our current cash flow projections prove to be inaccurate, we expect to be able to remain in compliance with such financial covenants by one or more of the following actions: issue debt and equity securities in conjunction with the acquisition of another business; issue equity in a public or private offering; request a modification of our covenants from our bank group; reduce distributions from our current distribution rate or obtain an equity infusion pursuant to the terms of our revolving credit facility.\nFor a more detailed description of our revolving credit facility including the covenants and restrictions contained therein, please refer to Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.\nCommitment Letter\nIn connection with the CDM Acquisition, on January 15, 2018, we entered into a commitment letter with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Barclays Bank PLC, as modified by the joinder to commitment letter and bridge fee letter entered into by the Partnership, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Barclays Bank PLC with each of Regions Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., MUFG Union Bank, N.A., a member of MUFG, a global financial group, The Bank of Nova Scotia and SunTrust Bank and certain affiliates of such parties (the Commitment Letter\u201d). The Commitment Letter provides for senior unsecured bridge loans in an aggregate amount up to $725 million (the Bridge Loans\u201d). The proceeds of such Bridge Loans may be used (a) to finance a portion of the purchase price of the CDM Acquisition and (b) to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith. The availability of the borrowings is subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions.\nDistribution Reinvestment Plan\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, distributions of $20.3 million were reinvested under the DRIP resulting in the issuance of 1.2 million common units. Such distributions are treated as non-cash transactions in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included under Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nFor a more detailed description of the DRIP, please refer to Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements.\nTotal Contractual Cash Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our total contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMore than\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2 - 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4 - 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n782,902 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n782,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest on long-term debt obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n54,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n27,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n27,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEquipment/capital purchases (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n122,156 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n119,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating lease obligations (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n962,626 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n148,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n814,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) We assumed that the amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2017 would be repaid in January 2020, the maturity date of the facility. \n (2) Represents future interest payments under our revolving credit facility based on the interest rate as of December 31, 2017 of 3.46%. \n (3) Represents commitments for new compression units that are being fabricated, and is a component of our overall projected expansion capital expenditures during 2018 of $130 million to $140 million. \n (4) Represents commitments for future minimum lease payments on noncancelable leases. \nEffects of Inflation. Our revenues and results of operations have not been materially impacted by inflation and changing prices in the past three fiscal years.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet financing activities. Please refer to Note 13 of our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a description of our commitments and contingencies.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements. These financial statements were prepared in conformity with GAAP. As such, we are required to make\ncertain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. We base our estimates on historical experience, available information and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates; however, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The accounting policies that we believe require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and are the most critical to its reporting of results of operations and financial position are as follows:\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue using the following criteria: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (iii) the customer's price is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.\nRevenue from compression services is recognized ratably under our fixed-fee contracts over the term of the contract as compression services are provided to our customers. Compression services generally are billed monthly, one month in advance of the commencement of the service month, except for certain customers who are billed at the beginning of the service month. Amounts invoiced in advance are recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet until earned, at which time it is recognized as revenue.\nRevenue and the associated expense from installation services, which includes the installation of stations for our customers, is recorded using the percentage-of-completion method measured using the efforts-expended method. In applying the percentage-of-completion method, we use the percentage of total workflows to date that have been completed relative to estimated total workflows to be completed in order to estimate the progress towards completion to determine the amount of revenue and profit to recognize for each contract.\nThe percentage-of-completion method of revenue recognition requires us to make estimates of contract revenues and costs to complete our projects. In making such estimates, management judgments are required to evaluate significant assumptions including the cost of materials and labor, expected labor productivity, the impact of potential variances in schedule completion, the amount of net contract revenues and the impact of any penalties, claims, change orders, or performance incentives.\nBusiness Combinations and Goodwill\nGoodwill acquired in connection with business combinations represents the excess of consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired. Certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment annually based on the carrying values as of October 1, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise that suggest the carrying value of goodwill may not be recovered.\nGoodwill-Impairment Assessments\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually on October 1 of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our single business reporting unit could be less than its carrying value (including goodwill). The timing of the annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods.\nWe estimate the fair value of our reporting unit based on a number of factors, including the potential value we would receive if we sold the reporting unit, enterprise value, discount rates and projected cash flows. Estimating projected cash flows requires us to make certain assumptions as it relates to future operating performance. When considering operating performance, various factors are considered such as current and changing economic conditions and the commodity price environment, among others. Due to the imprecise nature of these projections and assumptions, actual results can and often do, differ from our estimates. If the growth assumptions embodied in the current year impairment testing prove inaccurate, we could incur an impairment charge in the future.\nOn October 1, 2017 and 2016, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test, wherein we compared the estimated fair value of our single reporting unit to its carrying value. The estimated fair value of our reporting unit, measured based on market capitalization, as of October 1, 2017 and 2016 exceeded its carrying value in excess of 20% and we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired. We recorded no goodwill impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. We had approximately $35.9 million of goodwill recorded on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nOn October 1, 2015, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and concluded that our goodwill was not impaired. We updated our impairment test as of December 31, 2015 as certain potential impairment indicators were identified during the fourth quarter, specifically (1) the decline in the market price of our common units, (2) the sustained decline in global commodity prices, and (3) the decline in performance of the Alerian MLP Index, which indicated the reporting unit had a fair value that was less than its carrying value as of December 31, 2015. We prepared a quantitative assessment as of December 31, 2015 which indicated that the calculated fair value was less than the carrying value. We subsequently performed step two\u201d impairment test for our reporting unit under which we treated our business as if it had been acquired in a business combination as of December 31, 2015 and assigned the fair value of the reporting unit to all of our assets and liabilities. The carrying value of the goodwill was compared to the new implied fair value of goodwill and an impairment was recognized for the amount of the carrying value that exceeded the implied fair value. Based on that step two impairment test, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $172.2 million.
