Neither AGP nor Titan are currently paying distributions. Though we consolidate the operations of AGP (and, prior to July 27, 2016, we consolidated the operations of ARP) for financial reporting purposes, AGP's annual management fee and distributions from Lightfoot are currently our only sources of liquidity to satisfy our obligations under our credit agreements. In addition, Lightfoot completed a portion of its sale transaction that will result in lower quarterly distributions to us.\nWe used the net proceeds from the Lightfoot transaction to pay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our first lien credit agreement, the maturity of which was recently extended to June 30, 2018. As a result, we continue to face significant liquidity issues and are currently considering, and are likely to make, changes to our capital structure to maintain sufficient liquidity, meet our debt obligations and strengthen our balance sheet. Without a further extension or other significant transaction or capital infusion, we do not expect to have sufficient liquidity to repay our first lien credit agreement at maturity. Please see Liquidity and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\u201d for additional disclosures.\nLIQUIDITY AND ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash distributions received with respect to our ownership interests in AGP, Lightfoot, and Titan and AGP's annual management fee. However, neither Titan nor AGP is currently paying distributions. In addition, Lightfoot completed a portion of its sale transaction that will result in lower quarterly distributions to us. Our primary cash requirements, in addition to normal operating expenses, are for debt service and capital expenditures. In addition, the obligations under our first lien credit agreement mature in June 2018. Accordingly, our sources of liquidity are currently not sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our credit agreements.\nThe significant risks and uncertainties related to our primary sources of liquidity raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to remain in compliance with the covenants under our credit agreements, absent relief from our lenders, we may be forced to repay or refinance such indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lenders under our credit agreements could elect to declare all amounts outstanding immediately due and payable and could terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If an event of default occurs, we will not have sufficient liquidity to repay all of our outstanding indebtedness, and as a result, there would be substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOn April 26, 2018, we entered into an agreement with our lenders to extend the maturity date of our first lien credit agreement to June 30, 2018. In addition to the $20.7 million of indebtedness due on June 30, 2018, we classified the remaining $59.6 million of outstanding indebtedness under our credit agreements as a current liability, based on the uncertainty regarding future covenant compliance. In total, we have $79.4 million of outstanding indebtedness under our credit agreements, which is net of $0.8 million of debt discounts and $0.1 million of deferred financing costs, as current portion of long term debt, net within our combined consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017.\nWe continually monitor capital markets and may make changes from time to time to our capital structures, with the goal of maintaining financial flexibility, preserving or improving liquidity, strengthening the balance sheet, meeting debt service obligations and/or achieving cost efficiency. For example, we could pursue options such as refinancing or reorganizing our indebtedness or capital structure or seek to raise additional capital through debt or equity financing to address our liquidity concerns and high debt levels. There is no certainty that we will be able to implement any such options, and we cannot provide any assurances that any refinancing or changes to our debt or equity capital structure would be possible or that additional equity or debt financing could be obtained on acceptable terms, if at all, and such options may result in a wide range of outcomes for our stakeholders, including cancellation of debt income ( CODI\u201d) which would be directly allocated to our unitholders and reported on such unitholders' separate returns. It is possible additional adjustments to our strategic plan and outlook may occur based on market conditions and our needs at that time, which could include selling assets or seeking additional partners to develop our assets\nOur combined consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. Our combined consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the going concern uncertainty. If we cannot continue as a going concern, adjustments to the carrying values and classification of our assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses could be required and could be material.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nAGP Eagle Ford Drilling. AGP is deploying $6.5 million of cash on hand to drill and complete one Eagle Ford shale well, expected to be in-line during the second quarter of 2018. The well is expected to significantly increase AGP's production and provide substantial cash flow. The economics of drilling new oil wells across the AGP's acreage position in the Eagle Ford shale in South Texas have improved substantially over the last twelve months, driven by both a rise in oil prices, as well as significant advancements in drilling and completion technology.\nCredit Agreement Maturity Date Extensions. On April 26, 2018, we entered into an agreement with our lenders to extend the maturity date of our first lien credit agreement to June 30, 2018. See above Liquidity and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern section for further disclosures.\nLightfoot Transactions. On August 29, 2017, Lightfoot, announced a purchase agreement and plan of merger with Zenith Energy U.S., L.P. (together with its affiliates, Zenith\u201d), pursuant to which Zenith would acquire the general partner of Arc Logistics Partners, LP and all of the outstanding common units of Arc Logistics Partners, LP, a subsidiary of Lightfoot. On December 21, 2017 Lightfoot completed the first portion of this transaction, which resulted in net proceeds to us of $21.6 million. We used the net proceeds from this transaction to pay down $21.6 million of outstanding obligations\nunder our first lien credit agreement. The remaining second portion of this transaction is targeted to close in the second quarter 2018. We anticipate receiving additional net proceeds of approximately $3.0 million and plan to pay down outstanding obligations under our first lien credit agreement. See Item 8: Financial Statement and Supplementary Data - Note 2 for additional disclosures regarding the Lightfoot transactions.\nOsprey Sponsor Interest. In August 2017, we received a membership interest in Osprey Sponsor, which is the sponsor of Osprey. Osprey was formed for the purpose of acquiring, through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or other similar business transaction, one or more operating businesses or assets (a Business Combination\u201d) that Osprey has not yet identified. Our membership interest in Osprey Sponsor is an allocation of 1,250,000 founder shares, consisting of 1,250,000 shares of Class B common stock of Osprey that are automatically convertible into Class A common stock of Osprey upon the consummation of a business combination on a one-for-one basis. There can be no certainty, however, that Osprey will consummate a business combination transaction or that we will ultimately experience any value from our interest in Osprey. See Item 8: Financial Statement and Supplementary Data - Note 2 for additional disclosures regarding our Osprey Sponsor Interest.\nFINANCIAL PRESENTATION\nOur combined consolidated financial statements contain our accounts and those of our combined consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017. We determined that ARP (through the Plan Effective Date, as discussed further below) and AGP are variable interest entities ( VIE's\u201d) based on their respective partnership agreements, our power, as the general partner, to direct the activities that most significantly impact each of their respective economic performance, and our ownership of each of their respective incentive distribution rights. Accordingly, we consolidated the financial statements of ARP (until the date of ARP's Chapter 11 Filings, as discussed further below) and AGP into our combined consolidated financial statements. As the general partner for both ARP (through the Plan Effective Date) and AGP, we have unlimited liability for the obligations of ARP (through the Plan Effective Date) and AGP except for those contractual obligations that are expressly made without recourse to the general partner. The non-controlling interests in ARP (through the date of ARP's Chapter 11 Filings, as discussed further below) and AGP are reflected as (income) loss attributable to non-controlling interests in the combined consolidated statements of operations and as a component of unitholders' equity on the combined consolidated balance sheets. All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated.\nThroughout this section, when we refer to our\u201d combined consolidated financial statements, we are referring to the combined consolidated results for us, our wholly-owned subsidiaries and the consolidated results of ARP (as applicable) and AGP, adjusted for non-controlling interests in ARP and AGP.\nARP Restructuring, Emergence from Chapter 11 Proceedings, and VIE Considerations\nOn July 25, 2016, we, solely with respect to certain sections thereof, along with ARP and certain of its subsidiaries, entered into a restructuring support Agreement with certain of ARP's and such subsidiaries' lenders to support ARP's restructuring pursuant to a pre-packaged plan of reorganization (the Plan\u201d).\nOn July 27, 2016, ARP and certain of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court,\u201d and the cases commenced thereby, the Chapter 11 Filings\u201d). The cases commenced thereby were jointly administered under the caption In re: ATLAS RESOURCE PARTNERS, L.P., et al.\u201d\nOn August 26, 2016, an order confirming the Plan was entered by the Bankruptcy Court. On September 1, 2016, (the Plan Effective Date\u201d), pursuant to the Plan, Titan emerged.\nIn connection with ARP's Chapter 11 Filings on July 27, 2016, we deconsolidated ARP's financial statements from our combined consolidated financial statements, as we no longer had the power to direct the activities that most significantly impacted ARP's economic performance; however, we retained the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial decisions of ARP and therefore applied the equity method of accounting for our investment in ARP up to the Plan Effective Date. As a result of these changes, our combined consolidated financial statements subsequent to ARP's Chapter 11 Filings will not be comparable to our combined consolidated financial statements prior to ARP's Chapter 11 Filings. Our financial results for future periods following the application of equity method accounting will be different from historical trends and the differences may be material.\nOn the Plan Effective Date, we determined that Titan is a VIE based on its limited liability company agreement and the delegation of management and omnibus agreements between Titan and Titan Management, which provide us the power to direct activities that most significantly impact Titan's economic performance, but we do not have a controlling financial\ninterest. As a result, we do not consolidate Titan but rather apply the equity method of accounting as we have the ability to exercise significant influence over Titan's operating and financial decisions.\nGENERAL TRENDS AND OUTLOOK\nWe expect our business to be affected by key trends in natural gas and oil production markets. Our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us. To the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from our expected results.\nThroughout 2017, the natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids commodity price markets were marked by volatility. While we anticipate continued high levels of exploration and production activities over the long-term in the areas in which we operate, fluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect production rates and investments in the development of new natural gas, oil and NGL reserves. The economics of drilling new oil wells across the our acreage position in the Eagle Ford shale in South Texas have improved substantially over the last twelve months, driven by both a rise in oil prices, as well as significant advancements in drilling and completion technology.\nAGP's future gas and oil reserves, production, cash flow, ability to make payments on our obligations and our ability to make distributions to their unitholders, depend on its success in producing our current reserves efficiently, developing its existing acreage and acquiring additional proved reserves economically. We face the challenge of natural production declines and volatile natural gas, oil and NGL prices. As initial reservoir pressures are depleted, natural gas and oil production from particular wells decrease. We attempt to overcome this natural decline by drilling to find additional reserves and acquiring more reserves than we produce. To the extent we would not have access to sufficient capital, our ability to drill and acquire more reserves would be negatively impacted.\nFor additional information, please see Liquidity and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.\u201d\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGas and Oil Production\nWe deconsolidated ARP for financial reporting purposes as of the date of the Chapter 11 Filings and therefore our 2016 combined consolidated financial statements will not be comparable to our 2017 and 2015 combined consolidated financial statements.\nProduction Profile. Currently, our gas and oil production revenues and expenses consist of our gas and oil production activities derived from our wells drilled in the Eagle Ford, Marble Falls and Mississippi Lime plays. We have established production positions in the following operating areas:\nTable 173: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the Eagle Ford Shale in southern Texas, an oil-rich area, in which we acquired acreage in November 2014, where we derive over 92% of our production volumes and 96% of our revenues;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the Marble Falls play in the Fort Worth Basin in northern Texas, in which we own acreage and producing wells, which contains liquids rich natural gas and oil, and;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the Mississippi Lime play in northwestern Oklahoma, an oil and NGL-rich area.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduction Volumes.

Derivatives. We recognize changes in the fair value of derivatives immediately within gain (loss) on mark-to-market derivatives on our combined consolidated statements of operations. The recognized gains during the year ended December 31, 2017 were due to changes in commodity futures prices relative to our derivative positions as of the respective prior period end. The recognized losses and gains during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were related to the changes in oil prices during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 as compared to the prior year periods. In addition, we deconsolidated ARP as of July 27, 2016 which affects the comparability of the periods presented.\nGeneral and Administrative. Our $5.0 million decrease in general and administrative expenses in the year ended December 31, 2017, was due to a $5.1 million decrease in stock compensation expense related to the forfeiture of employee awards due to Titan's completion of the majority of sale of its Appalachian assets and reductions in workforce and a $0.7 million decrease in non-recurring transaction costs, partially offset by a $0.7 million increase in salaries and wages and a $0.2 million increase in other corporate activities. ARP's $41.0 million decrease in general and administrative expenses in year ended December 31, 2017 was due to our deconsolidation of ARP as of July 27, 2016, which affects the comparability of the periods presented. AGP's decrease in general and administrative expenses in the year ended December 31, 2017 was due to a $5.0 million decrease in salaries, wages and other corporate activity costs allocated to us as a result of the suspension of our current primary offering efforts and management's plan to reduce general and administrative expenses.\nOur $25.3 million decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to a $17.1 million decrease in non-recurring transaction costs attributable to our spin-off from Atlas Energy during the prior year period, a $6.2 million decrease in salaries, wages and benefits, a $1.3 million decrease in other corporate activities and a $0.7 million increase in stock compensation expense. ARP's $25.0 million decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year period is due to the deconsolidation of ARP as of July 27, 2016, which affects the comparability of the periods presented. AGP's decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year period was due to a $2.8 million decrease in salaries, wages and other corporate activity costs allocated by us and ARP/Titan to AGP in connection with the completion of AGP's private placement offering in June 2015.\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization. ARP's decrease in depreciation, depletion and amortization in the current year ended December 31, 2017 was due to our deconsolidation of ARP as of July 27, 2016, which affects the comparability of the periods presented. AGP's decrease in depreciation, depletion and amortization for the current year as compared to the prior year was primarily due to a $11.3 million decrease in its depletion expense resulting from the asset impairments recorded in the 4th quarter of 2016, which lowered our depletable base, and lower production volumes.\nARP's decrease in depletion expense and depletion expense per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year period was due to the deconsolidation of ARP as of July 27, 2016, which affects the comparability of the periods presented. AGP's increases in depletion expense, depletion expenses as a percentage of gas and oil revenues and depletion expenses per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year period were primarily due to an increase in AGP's depletion expense associated with the expansion of AGP's Eagle Ford operations, partially offset by a decrease in oil volumes from AGP's Marble Falls operations.\nAsset Impairment. For the year ended December 31, 2016, AGP recognized $25.4 million and $16.5 million of asset impairment related to its proved and unproved oil and gas properties in the Eagle Ford operating area, respectively, which were impaired due to lower forecasted commodity prices and timing of capital financing and deployment for the development of our undeveloped properties. For the year ended December 31, 2015, AGP recognized $7.3 million of asset impairment related to its proved oil and gas properties in the Marble Falls and Mississippi Lime operating areas, which were impaired due to lower forecasted commodity prices. ARP's $966.6 million of asset impairment for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to oil and gas properties in the Barnett, Coal-bed Methane, Rangely, Southern Appalachia, Marcellus and Mississippi Lime operating areas, which were impaired due to lower forecasted commodity prices, net of $85.8 million of future hedge gains reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income.\nInterest Expense. The increase in our interest expense in year ended December 31, 2017 consisted of a $7.6 million increase of paid-in-kind interest on our credit agreements, partially offset by a $1.1 million decrease in interest on the original term loans with Riverstone and a $0.3 million decrease in amortization of our deferred financing costs. ARP's $68.9 million decrease in interest expense in the year ended December 31, 2017 was due to our deconsolidation of ARP as of July 27, 2016, which affects the comparability of the periods presented.\nThe decrease in our interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year period consisted of $5.7 million of accelerated amortization of the deferred financing costs associated with the portion of Atlas Energy's Term Loan Facility allocated to us in February 2015, a $6.1 million decrease in interest on outstanding term loans primarily resulting from lower outstanding borrowings and the refinancing of the Deutsche Bank Term Loan in 2015 to the Riverstone Term Loan Facilities in March 2016 that among other things decreased the interest rate by approximately 6% per annum, $3.2 million of discount amortization for Atlas Energy's Term Loan Facility allocated to us in the prior year period, $2.9 million of accelerated amortization of the discount of Atlas Energy's Term Loan Facility allocated to us resulting from repayments made to reduce the outstanding balance during the prior year period, $2.3 million of discount amortization for our Term Loan Facilities with Deutsche Bank during the year ended December 31, 2015, $0.5 million accelerated amortization\nassociated with a paydown of the Riverstone Term Loan and $0.3 million for amortization of our deferred financing costs in the prior year period, partially offset by the $11.7 million of paid-in-kind interest on our current Riverstone Credit Agreements and $0.6 million of amortization of warrants that were issued in connection with the Second Lien Credit Agreement. ARP's $33.3 million decrease interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year period is due to the deconsolidation of ARP as of July 27, 2016, which affects the comparability of the periods presented.\nGain (Loss) on Early Extinguishment of Debt. The decrease in our loss on early extinguishment of debt in the year ended December 31, 2017 was due to $3.7 million of accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs and $2.4 million of prepayment penalties related to the restructuring of our original term loans with Riverstone in the first quarter of 2016. ARP's $26.5 million decrease in gain on early extinguishment of debt was related to the repurchase of a portion of ARP's senior notes in the first quarter of 2016.\nReorganization Items, Net. The $21.6 million in ARP's reorganization items, net for the year ended December 31, 2016 represented incremental costs incurred as a result of ARP's Chapter 11 Filings.\nGain on deconsolidation of Atlas Resource Partners, L.P. As a result of deconsolidating ARP and recording our equity method investment in ARP at a fair value of zero on the date of the Chapter 11 Filings, we recognized a $47.0 million non-cash gain, which is recorded in gain on deconsolidation of ARP on our condensed combined consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOther income (loss). Our $6.9 million other income for the year ended December 31, 2017 represents a net gain on sale from the Lightfoot transaction. AGP's $5.3 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 was due to AGP's $5.3 million write-off of issuer costs related to its decision to suspend its primary offering efforts in light of new regulations and the challenging fund raising environment until such time as market participants have had an opportunity to ascertain the impact of such issues. ARP's $6.2 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 represents a non-cash loss, net of consolidation and transfer adjustments, of certain Drilling Partnerships' consolidation and transfer of oil and gas properties and asset retirement obligations to ARP during the period.\nLoss Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests. The decrease in loss attributable to non-controlling interests in the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the deconsolidation of ARP as of July 27, 2016, which affects the comparability of the periods presented.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nSee Liquidity and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\u201d section above for additional disclosures regarding our liquidity and financial condition.\nCash Flows\nTable 186: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities............\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,102\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 179,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities.....................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (28,913\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (277,915\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities............\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21,647\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (169,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 243,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nWe deconsolidated ARP for financial reporting purposes as of July 27, 2016 (the date of ARP's Chapter 11 Filings) and therefore our 2017 cash flows will not be comparable to our 2016 cash flows.\nCash Flows From Operating Activities:\nThe change in cash flows used in operating activities compared with the prior year period was due to:\nTable 187: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a decrease from ARP's $243.5 million sale of substantially all of its commodity hedge positions on July 25, 2016 and July 26, 2016;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 188: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a decrease of $53.6 million of cash paid for interest related to ARP's debts due to the deconsolidation of ARP on the date of the Chapter 11 Filings;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 189: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a decrease of $36.7 million of investor capital raised transferred by ARP to the Atlas Eagle Ford 2015 L.P. private drilling partnership for activities directly related to their program in March of 2016;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 190: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a decrease of $20.4 million in distributions paid to non-controlling interests;

See Item 8: Financial Statement and Supplementary Data - Note 5 for additional disclosures regarding our First Lien Credit Agreement's terms and provisions.\nAs of December 31, 2017 we have $20.7 million of outstanding indebtedness under the First Lien Credit Agreement, which is scheduled to mature on June 30, 2018.\nSee Liquidity and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\u201d above for additional disclosures regarding our liquidity and financial condition.\nSecond Lien Credit Agreement. Also on March 30, 2016, we and the Borrower entered into a new second lien credit agreement (the Second Lien Credit Agreement\u201d) with Riverstone and the Lenders. As described above, $35.8 million of the indebtedness previously outstanding under the First Lien Credit Agreement was moved under the Second Lien Credit Agreement.

See Item 8: Financial\nStatement and Supplementary Data - Note 5 for additional disclosures regarding our Second Lien Credit Agreement's terms and provisions.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $59.6 million of outstanding indebtedness under the Second Lien Credit Agreement, which is scheduled to mature on March 30, 2019.\nSee Liquidity and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\u201d section above for additional disclosures regarding our liquidity and financial condition.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of actual revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results may differ from the estimates on which our financial statements are prepared at any given point of time. Changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include revenue and expense accruals, depletion and impairment of gas and oil properties, and fair value of derivative instruments. We summarize our significant accounting policies within our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes 2, 3 and 5 included in this report. The critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified are discussed below.\nGas and Oil Properties - Depletion and Impairment\nWe follow the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities. Exploratory drilling costs are capitalized pending determination of whether a well is successful. Exploratory wells subsequently determined to be dry holes are charged to expense. Costs resulting in exploratory discoveries and all development costs, whether successful or not, are capitalized. Geological and geophysical costs to enhance or evaluate development of proved fields or areas are capitalized. All other geological and geophysical costs, delay rentals and unsuccessful exploratory wells are expensed.\nOur depletion expense is determined on a field-by-field basis using the units-of-production method. Depletion rates for leasehold acquisition costs are based on estimated proved reserves, and depletion rates for well and related equipment costs are based on proved developed reserves associated with each field. Depletion rates are determined based on reserve quantity estimates and the capitalized costs of undeveloped and developed producing properties. Capitalized costs of developed producing properties in each field are aggregated to include our costs of property interests in joint venture wells, wells drilled solely by us for our interests, properties purchased and working interests with other outside operators.\nWe review our gas and oil properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Events or changes in circumstances that would indicate the need for impairment testing include, among other factors: operating losses; unused capacity; market value declines; technological developments resulting in obsolescence; changes in demand for products manufactured by others utilizing our services or for our products; changes in competition and competitive practices; uncertainties associated with the United States and world economies; changes in the expected level of environmental capital, operating or remediation expenditures; and changes in governmental regulations or actions. Additional factors impacting the economic viability of long-lived assets are discussed under Item 1A: Risk Factors in this report. If it is determined that an asset's estimated future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover its carrying amount, an impairment charge will be recorded to reduce the carrying amount for that asset to its estimated fair value if such carrying amount exceeds the fair value.\nOur unproved properties are assessed individually based on several factors including if a dry hole has been drilled in the area, other wells drilled in the area and operating results, remaining months in the lease's primary term, and management's future plans to drill and develop the area. As exploration and development work progresses and the reserves on properties are proven, capitalized costs of these properties are subject to depletion. If exploration activities are unsuccessful, the capitalized costs of the properties related to the unsuccessful work is charged to exploration expense. The timing of impairment of any significant unproved properties depends upon the nature, timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results.\nThe review of our proved oil and gas properties is done on a field-by-field basis by determining if the net carrying value of proved properties is less than the estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows. The expected future cash flows\nare estimated based on management's plans to continue to produce and develop proved reserves. Expected future cash flows from the sale of production of reserves are calculated based on estimated future prices. We estimate prices based upon current contracts in place, adjusted for basis differentials and market related information including published future prices. The estimated future level of production is based on assumptions surrounding future prices and costs, field decline rates, market demand and supply and the economic and regulatory climates. If the carrying value exceeds the expected undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair market value (as determined by discounted future cash flows) and the carrying value of the assets.\nThe determination of oil and natural gas reserve estimates is a subjective process, and the accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data and the application of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Estimates of economically recoverable reserves and future net cash flows depend on a number of variable factors and assumptions that are difficult to predict and may vary considerably from actual results. Our reserve estimates are based upon reserve analyses that rely upon various assumptions, including those required by the SEC, as to natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures and availability of funds. Reserve estimates for wells with limited or no production history are less reliable than those based on actual production. Estimated reserves are often subject to future revisions, which could be substantial, based on the availability of additional information which could cause the assumptions to be modified. We cannot predict what reserve revisions may be required in future periods. Any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. As discussed in General Trends and Outlook\u201d within this section, recent increases in natural gas and oil drilling have driven an increase in the supply of natural gas and oil and put a downward pressure on domestic prices. Further declines in commodity prices may result in additional impairment charges in future periods.\nReserve Estimates\nOur estimates of proved natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids reserves and future net revenues from them are based upon reserve analyses that rely upon various assumptions, including those required by the SEC, as to natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures and availability of funds. The accuracy of these reserve estimates is a function of many factors including the following: the quality and quantity of available data, the interpretation of that data, the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and the judgments of the individuals preparing the estimates. We engaged independent third-party reserve engineers to prepare annual reports of our proved reserves (see Item 2: Properties).\nAny significant variance in the assumptions utilized in the calculation of our reserve estimates could materially affect the estimated quantity of our reserves. As a result, our estimates of proved natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids reserves are inherently imprecise. Actual future production, natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids prices, revenues, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids reserves may vary substantially from our estimates or estimates contained in the reserve reports. In addition, our proved reserves may be subject to downward or upward revision based upon production history, results of future exploration and development, prevailing natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids prices, mechanical difficulties, governmental regulation and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our reserves and their relation to estimated future net cash flows impact the calculation of impairment and depletion of oil and gas properties. Adjustments to quarterly depletion rates, which are based upon a units of production method, are made concurrently with changes to reserve estimates. Generally, an increase or decrease in reserves without a corresponding change in capitalized costs will have a corresponding inverse impact to depletion expense.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nSee Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to recently issued accounting standards.\nTable 222: <table> <tr> <td>", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I am unable to complete your request because I am unable to identify the context of your request.\n- Could you please provide additional details or more information regarding your request?\n- I'm sorry, but I am unable to understand the request because it seems to be incomplete or unclear.\n- I'm sorry, but I am unable to respond to your request because it appears to be out of the scope of my capabilities.\n- I'm sorry, but I am unable to understand or fulfill your request because it appears to be ambiguous or unclear.\n- I'm sorry, but I cannot respond to your request because I am unable to authenticate or verify the information you have provided.\n- I'm sorry, but I am unable to complete your request at this time.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a publicly traded (OTCQB: ATLS) Delaware limited liability company formed in October 2011.\nOur operations primarily consisted of our ownership interests in the following:\n \u2022 All of the incentive distribution rights, an 80.0% general partner interest and a 2.1% limited partner interest in Atlas Growth Partners, L.P. ( AGP\u201d), a Delaware limited partnership and an independent developer and producer of natural gas, crude oil and NGLs with operations primarily focused in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas; \n \u2022 A 12.0% limited partner interest in Lightfoot Capital Partners, L.P. ( Lightfoot L.P.\u201d) and a 15.9% general partner interest in Lightfoot Capital Partners GP, LLC ( Lightfoot G.P.\u201d and together with Lightfoot L.P., Lightfoot\u201d), the general partner of Lightfoot L.P., an entity for which Jonathan Cohen, Executive Chairman of the Company's board of directors, is the Chairman of the board of directors. Lightfoot focuses its investments primarily on incubating new MLPs and providing capital to existing MLPs in need of additional equity or structured debt. On August 29, 2017, Lightfoot announced a proposed sale transaction. Please see Recent Developments-Lightfoot Transactions\u201d for further disclosures regarding Lightfoot; \n \u2022 A membership interest in the founder shares of Osprey Sponsor, LLC ( Osprey Sponsor\u201d) received in August 2017. Osprey Sponsor is the sponsor of Osprey Energy Acquisition Corp ( Osprey\u201d). We received our membership interest in recognition of potential utilization, if any, of our office space, advisory services and personnel by Osprey. Please see Recent Developments - Osprey Sponsor Interest\u201d for further disclosures regarding Osprey; \n \u2022 Commencing September 1, 2016, Titan Energy, LLC ( Titan\u201d), an independent developer and producer of natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids ( NGL\u201d) with operations in basins across the United States but primarily focused on the horizontal development of resource potential from the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas. Titan Energy Management, LLC, our wholly owned subsidiary ( Titan Management\u201d), holds the Series A Preferred Share of Titan, which entitles us to receive 2% of the aggregate of distributions paid to shareholders (as if we held 2% of Titan's members' equity, subject to potential dilution in the event of future equity interests) and to appoint four of seven directors. Titan sponsors and manages tax-advantaged investment partnerships (the Drilling Partnerships\u201d), in which it coinvests, to finance a portion of its natural gas, crude oil and NGL production activities. As discussed further below, Titan is the successor to the business and operations of Atlas Resource Partners, L.P. ( ARP\u201d); \n \u2022 Through August 31, 2016, 100% of the general partner Class A units, all of the incentive distribution rights, and an approximate 23.3% limited partner interest in ARP. As discussed further below, ARP was the predecessor to the business and operations of Titan. \nOur cash flows and liquidity are substantially dependent upon AGP's annual management fee and distributions from AGP, Lightfoot, and Titan. Neither AGP nor Titan are currently paying distributions. Though we consolidate the operations of AGP (and, prior to July 27, 2016, we consolidated the operations of ARP) for financial reporting purposes, AGP's annual management fee and distributions from Lightfoot are currently our only sources of liquidity to satisfy our obligations under our credit agreements. In addition, Lightfoot completed a portion of its sale transaction that will result in lower quarterly distributions to us.\nWe used the net proceeds from the Lightfoot transaction to pay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our first lien credit agreement, the maturity of which was recently extended to June 30, 2018. As a result, we continue to face significant liquidity issues and are currently considering, and are likely to make, changes to our capital structure to maintain sufficient liquidity, meet our debt obligations and strengthen our balance sheet. Without a further extension or other significant transaction or capital infusion, we do not expect to have sufficient liquidity to repay our first lien credit agreement at maturity. Please see Liquidity and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\u201d for additional disclosures.\nLIQUIDITY AND ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash distributions received with respect to our ownership interests in AGP, Lightfoot, and Titan and AGP's annual management fee. However, neither Titan nor AGP is currently paying distributions. In addition, Lightfoot completed a portion of its sale transaction that will result in lower quarterly distributions to us. Our primary cash requirements, in addition to normal operating expenses, are for debt service and capital expenditures. In addition, the obligations under our first lien credit agreement mature in June 2018. Accordingly, our sources of liquidity are currently not sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our credit agreements.\nThe significant risks and uncertainties related to our primary sources of liquidity raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to remain in compliance with the covenants under our credit agreements, absent relief from our lenders, we may be forced to repay or refinance such indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lenders under our credit agreements could elect to declare all amounts outstanding immediately due and payable and could terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If an event of default occurs, we will not have sufficient liquidity to repay all of our outstanding indebtedness, and as a result, there would be substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOn April 26, 2018, we entered into an agreement with our lenders to extend the maturity date of our first lien credit agreement to June 30, 2018. In addition to the $20.7 million of indebtedness due on June 30, 2018, we classified the remaining $59.6 million of outstanding indebtedness under our credit agreements as a current liability, based on the uncertainty regarding future covenant compliance. In total, we have $79.4 million of outstanding indebtedness under our credit agreements, which is net of $0.8 million of debt discounts and $0.1 million of deferred financing costs, as current portion of long term debt, net within our combined consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017.\nWe continually monitor capital markets and may make changes from time to time to our capital structures, with the goal of maintaining financial flexibility, preserving or improving liquidity, strengthening the balance sheet, meeting debt service obligations and/or achieving cost efficiency. For example, we could pursue options such as refinancing or reorganizing our indebtedness or capital structure or seek to raise additional capital through debt or equity financing to address our liquidity concerns and high debt levels. There is no certainty that we will be able to implement any such options, and we cannot provide any assurances that any refinancing or changes to our debt or equity capital structure would be possible or that additional equity or debt financing could be obtained on acceptable terms, if at all, and such options may result in a wide range of outcomes for our stakeholders, including cancellation of debt income ( CODI\u201d) which would be directly allocated to our unitholders and reported on such unitholders' separate returns. It is possible additional adjustments to our strategic plan and outlook may occur based on market conditions and our needs at that time, which could include selling assets or seeking additional partners to develop our assets\nOur combined consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. Our combined consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the going concern uncertainty. If we cannot continue as a going concern, adjustments to the carrying values and classification of our assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses could be required and could be material.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nAGP Eagle Ford Drilling. AGP is deploying $6.5 million of cash on hand to drill and complete one Eagle Ford shale well, expected to be in-line during the second quarter of 2018. The well is expected to significantly increase AGP's production and provide substantial cash flow. The economics of drilling new oil wells across the AGP's acreage position in the Eagle Ford shale in South Texas have improved substantially over the last twelve months, driven by both a rise in oil prices, as well as significant advancements in drilling and completion technology.\nCredit Agreement Maturity Date Extensions. On April 26, 2018, we entered into an agreement with our lenders to extend the maturity date of our first lien credit agreement to June 30, 2018. See above Liquidity and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern section for further disclosures.\nLightfoot Transactions. On August 29, 2017, Lightfoot, announced a purchase agreement and plan of merger with Zenith Energy U.S., L.P. (together with its affiliates, Zenith\u201d), pursuant to which Zenith would acquire the general partner of Arc Logistics Partners, LP and all of the outstanding common units of Arc Logistics Partners, LP, a subsidiary of Lightfoot. On December 21, 2017 Lightfoot completed the first portion of this transaction, which resulted in net proceeds to us of $21.6 million. We used the net proceeds from this transaction to pay down $21.6 million of outstanding obligations\nunder our first lien credit agreement. The remaining second portion of this transaction is targeted to close in the second quarter 2018. We anticipate receiving additional net proceeds of approximately $3.0 million and plan to pay down outstanding obligations under our first lien credit agreement. See Item 8: Financial Statement and Supplementary Data - Note 2 for additional disclosures regarding the Lightfoot transactions.\nOsprey Sponsor Interest. In August 2017, we received a membership interest in Osprey Sponsor, which is the sponsor of Osprey. Osprey was formed for the purpose of acquiring, through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or other similar business transaction, one or more operating businesses or assets (a Business Combination\u201d) that Osprey has not yet identified. Our membership interest in Osprey Sponsor is an allocation of 1,250,000 founder shares, consisting of 1,250,000 shares of Class B common stock of Osprey that are automatically convertible into Class A common stock of Osprey upon the consummation of a business combination on a one-for-one basis. There can be no certainty, however, that Osprey will consummate a business combination transaction or that we will ultimately experience any value from our interest in Osprey. See Item 8: Financial Statement and Supplementary Data - Note 2 for additional disclosures regarding our Osprey Sponsor Interest.\nFINANCIAL PRESENTATION\nOur combined consolidated financial statements contain our accounts and those of our combined consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017. We determined that ARP (through the Plan Effective Date, as discussed further below) and AGP are variable interest entities ( VIE's\u201d) based on their respective partnership agreements, our power, as the general partner, to direct the activities that most significantly impact each of their respective economic performance, and our ownership of each of their respective incentive distribution rights. Accordingly, we consolidated the financial statements of ARP (until the date of ARP's Chapter 11 Filings, as discussed further below) and AGP into our combined consolidated financial statements. As the general partner for both ARP (through the Plan Effective Date) and AGP, we have unlimited liability for the obligations of ARP (through the Plan Effective Date) and AGP except for those contractual obligations that are expressly made without recourse to the general partner. The non-controlling interests in ARP (through the date of ARP's Chapter 11 Filings, as discussed further below) and AGP are reflected as (income) loss attributable to non-controlling interests in the combined consolidated statements of operations and as a component of unitholders' equity on the combined consolidated balance sheets. All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated.\nThroughout this section, when we refer to our\u201d combined consolidated financial statements, we are referring to the combined consolidated results for us, our wholly-owned subsidiaries and the consolidated results of ARP (as applicable) and AGP, adjusted for non-controlling interests in ARP and AGP.\nARP Restructuring, Emergence from Chapter 11 Proceedings, and VIE Considerations\nOn July 25, 2016, we, solely with respect to certain sections thereof, along with ARP and certain of its subsidiaries, entered into a restructuring support Agreement with certain of ARP's and such subsidiaries' lenders to support ARP's restructuring pursuant to a pre-packaged plan of reorganization (the Plan\u201d).\nOn July 27, 2016, ARP and certain of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court,\u201d and the cases commenced thereby, the Chapter 11 Filings\u201d). The cases commenced thereby were jointly administered under the caption In re: ATLAS RESOURCE PARTNERS, L.P., et al.\u201d\nOn August 26, 2016, an order confirming the Plan was entered by the Bankruptcy Court. On September 1, 2016, (the Plan Effective Date\u201d), pursuant to the Plan, Titan emerged.\nIn connection with ARP's Chapter 11 Filings on July 27, 2016, we deconsolidated ARP's financial statements from our combined consolidated financial statements, as we no longer had the power to direct the activities that most significantly impacted ARP's economic performance; however, we retained the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial decisions of ARP and therefore applied the equity method of accounting for our investment in ARP up to the Plan Effective Date. As a result of these changes, our combined consolidated financial statements subsequent to ARP's Chapter 11 Filings will not be comparable to our combined consolidated financial statements prior to ARP's Chapter 11 Filings. Our financial results for future periods following the application of equity method accounting will be different from historical trends and the differences may be material.\nOn the Plan Effective Date, we determined that Titan is a VIE based on its limited liability company agreement and the delegation of management and omnibus agreements between Titan and Titan Management, which provide us the power to direct activities that most significantly impact Titan's economic performance, but we do not have a controlling financial\ninterest. As a result, we do not consolidate Titan but rather apply the equity method of accounting as we have the ability to exercise significant influence over Titan's operating and financial decisions.\nGENERAL TRENDS AND OUTLOOK\nWe expect our business to be affected by key trends in natural gas and oil production markets. Our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us. To the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from our expected results.\nThroughout 2017, the natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids commodity price markets were marked by volatility. While we anticipate continued high levels of exploration and production activities over the long-term in the areas in which we operate, fluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect production rates and investments in the development of new natural gas, oil and NGL reserves. The economics of drilling new oil wells across the our acreage position in the Eagle Ford shale in South Texas have improved substantially over the last twelve months, driven by both a rise in oil prices, as well as significant advancements in drilling and completion technology.\nAGP's future gas and oil reserves, production, cash flow, ability to make payments on our obligations and our ability to make distributions to their unitholders, depend on its success in producing our current reserves efficiently, developing its existing acreage and acquiring additional proved reserves economically. We face the challenge of natural production declines and volatile natural gas, oil and NGL prices. As initial reservoir pressures are depleted, natural gas and oil production from particular wells decrease. We attempt to overcome this natural decline by drilling to find additional reserves and acquiring more reserves than we produce. To the extent we would not have access to sufficient capital, our ability to drill and acquire more reserves would be negatively impacted.\nFor additional information, please see Liquidity and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.\u201d\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGas and Oil Production\nWe deconsolidated ARP for financial reporting purposes as of the date of the Chapter 11 Filings and therefore our 2016 combined consolidated financial statements will not be comparable to our 2017 and 2015 combined consolidated financial statements.\nProduction Profile. Currently, our gas and oil production revenues and expenses consist of our gas and oil production activities derived from our wells drilled in the Eagle Ford, Marble Falls and Mississippi Lime plays. We have established production positions in the following operating areas:\n \u2022 the Eagle Ford Shale in southern Texas, an oil-rich area, in which we acquired acreage in November 2014, where we derive over 92% of our production volumes and 96% of our revenues; \n \u2022 the Marble Falls play in the Fort Worth Basin in northern Texas, in which we own acreage and producing wells, which contains liquids rich natural gas and oil, and; \n \u2022 the Mississippi Lime play in northwestern Oklahoma, an oil and NGL-rich area. \nProduction Volumes. The following table presents total net natural gas, crude oil and NGL production volumes and production per day for the periods indicated:\n\n\n (1) We deconsolidated ARP for financial reporting purposes as of July 27, 2016 (the date of ARP's Chapter 11 Filings) and therefore our 2016 results will not be comparable to our 2017 and 2015 results. \nProduction Revenues, Prices and Costs. Production revenues and estimated gas and oil reserves are substantially dependent on prevailing market prices for natural gas and oil. The following table presents production revenues and average sales prices for AGP's and ARP's natural gas, oil, and NGLs production for each of the periods indicated, along with average production costs, which include lease operating expenses, taxes, and transportation and compression costs, in each of the reported periods:\n\n (1) Excludes the impact of subordination of ARP's production revenue to investor partners within its Drilling Partnerships for each of the periods presented. Including the effect of this subordination, ARP's average realized gas sales price was $3.41 per Mcf ($1.66 per Mcf before the effects of financial hedging) and $3.36 per Mcf ($2.19 per Mcf before the effects of financial hedging) for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \n (2) Excludes the effects of ARP's proportionate share of lease operating expenses associated with subordination of its production revenue to investor partners within its Drilling Partnerships for each of the periods presented. Including the effects of these costs, ARP's total lease operating expenses per Mcfe were $1.16 per Mcfe ($1.58 per Mcfe for total production costs) and $1.32 per Mcfe ($1.74 per Mcfe for total production costs) for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Including the effects of these costs, total lease operating expenses per Mcfe were $1.14 per Mcfe ($1.56 per Mcfe for total production costs) and $1.31 per Mcfe ($1.73 per Mcfe for total production costs) for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \n (4) We deconsolidated ARP for financial reporting purposes as of July 27, 2016 (the date of ARP's Chapter 11 Filings) and therefore our 2016 results will not be comparable to our 2017 and 2015 results. \n\nOur production revenues were lower in the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of a $118.1 million decrease in ARP's revenues due to the deconsolidation of ARP as of July 27, 2016, which affects the comparability of the periods presented, and a $4.0 million decrease in AGP's revenues attributable to production from AGP's Eagle Ford operations, primarily related to natural production decline without AGP having drilled any additional wells to offset such decline.\nOur production costs were lower in the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of a $75.4 million decrease in ARP's gas and oil production costs due to the deconsolidation of ARP as of July 27, 2016, which affects the comparability of the periods presented, and a $0.1 million decrease in AGP's gas and oil production costs attributable a decrease in maintenance, materials, and treating costs in AGP's Marble Falls operations.\nOur production revenues were lower for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year period primarily due to decreases in all ARP operating areas attributable to lower production volumes and decreases in oil and NGL commodity prices compared to the prior year period. In addition, we deconsolidated ARP as of July 27, 2016 which affects the comparability of the periods presented. AGP's gas and oil production revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were comparable to the prior year period consisting of a $0.9 million increase attributable to production from AGP's Eagle Ford operations, primarily related to two more wells being turned in line during 2016 and a full year of production for the wells that were turned in line during 2015, partially offset by an $0.8 million decrease attributable to AGP's Marble Falls operations primarily related to lower volumes and a $0.1 million decrease attributable to AGP's Mississippi Lime operations primarily related to lower volumes.\nOur production costs were lower in the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the prior year period primarily due to ARP's efforts to reduce operating costs in each of its areas of production. In addition, we deconsolidated ARP as of July 27, 2016 which affects the comparability of the periods presented. AGP's gas and oil production expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were comparable to the prior year period consisting of a $1.1 million increase attributable to AGP's Eagle Ford operations, partially offset by a decrease of $0.7 million attributable to AGP's Marble Falls operations.\nARP's Drilling Partnership Management\nThe following table presents the amounts of revenues and the related costs associated with these revenues during the periods indicated (dollars in thousands). We deconsolidated ARP for financial reporting purposes as of the date of the Chapter 11 Filings and therefore our 2016 combined consolidated financial statements will not be comparable to our 2017 and 2015 combined consolidated financial statements.\n\nOther Revenues and Expenses\n\nGain (Loss) on Mark-to-Market Derivatives. We recognize changes in the fair value of derivatives immediately within gain (loss) on mark-to-market derivatives on our combined consolidated statements of operations. The recognized gains during the year ended December 31, 2017 were due to changes in commodity futures prices relative to our derivative positions as of the respective prior period end. The recognized losses and gains during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were related to the changes in oil prices during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 as compared to the prior year periods. In addition, we deconsolidated ARP as of July 27, 2016 which affects the comparability of the periods presented.\nGeneral and Administrative. Our $5.0 million decrease in general and administrative expenses in the year ended December 31, 2017, was due to a $5.1 million decrease in stock compensation expense related to the forfeiture of employee awards due to Titan's completion of the majority of sale of its Appalachian assets and reductions in workforce and a $0.7 million decrease in non-recurring transaction costs, partially offset by a $0.7 million increase in salaries and wages and a $0.2 million increase in other corporate activities. ARP's $41.0 million decrease in general and administrative expenses in year ended December 31, 2017 was due to our deconsolidation of ARP as of July 27, 2016, which affects the comparability of the periods presented. AGP's decrease in general and administrative expenses in the year ended December 31, 2017 was due to a $5.0 million decrease in salaries, wages and other corporate activity costs allocated to us as a result of the suspension of our current primary offering efforts and management's plan to reduce general and administrative expenses.\nOur $25.3 million decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to a $17.1 million decrease in non-recurring transaction costs attributable to our spin-off from Atlas Energy during the prior year period, a $6.2 million decrease in salaries, wages and benefits, a $1.3 million decrease in other corporate activities and a $0.7 million increase in stock compensation expense. ARP's $25.0 million decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year period is due to the deconsolidation of ARP as of July 27, 2016, which affects the comparability of the periods presented. AGP's decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year period was due to a $2.8 million decrease in salaries, wages and other corporate activity costs allocated by us and ARP/Titan to AGP in connection with the completion of AGP's private placement offering in June 2015.\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization. ARP's decrease in depreciation, depletion and amortization in the current year ended December 31, 2017 was due to our deconsolidation of ARP as of July 27, 2016, which affects the comparability of the periods presented. AGP's decrease in depreciation, depletion and amortization for the current year as compared to the prior year was primarily due to a $11.3 million decrease in its depletion expense resulting from the asset impairments recorded in the 4th quarter of 2016, which lowered our depletable base, and lower production volumes.\nARP's decrease in depletion expense and depletion expense per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year period was due to the deconsolidation of ARP as of July 27, 2016, which affects the comparability of the periods presented. AGP's increases in depletion expense, depletion expenses as a percentage of gas and oil revenues and depletion expenses per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year period were primarily due to an increase in AGP's depletion expense associated with the expansion of AGP's Eagle Ford operations, partially offset by a decrease in oil volumes from AGP's Marble Falls operations.\nAsset Impairment. For the year ended December 31, 2016, AGP recognized $25.4 million and $16.5 million of asset impairment related to its proved and unproved oil and gas properties in the Eagle Ford operating area, respectively, which were impaired due to lower forecasted commodity prices and timing of capital financing and deployment for the development of our undeveloped properties. For the year ended December 31, 2015, AGP recognized $7.3 million of asset impairment related to its proved oil and gas properties in the Marble Falls and Mississippi Lime operating areas, which were impaired due to lower forecasted commodity prices. ARP's $966.6 million of asset impairment for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to oil and gas properties in the Barnett, Coal-bed Methane, Rangely, Southern Appalachia, Marcellus and Mississippi Lime operating areas, which were impaired due to lower forecasted commodity prices, net of $85.8 million of future hedge gains reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income.\nInterest Expense. The increase in our interest expense in year ended December 31, 2017 consisted of a $7.6 million increase of paid-in-kind interest on our credit agreements, partially offset by a $1.1 million decrease in interest on the original term loans with Riverstone and a $0.3 million decrease in amortization of our deferred financing costs. ARP's $68.9 million decrease in interest expense in the year ended December 31, 2017 was due to our deconsolidation of ARP as of July 27, 2016, which affects the comparability of the periods presented.\nThe decrease in our interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year period consisted of $5.7 million of accelerated amortization of the deferred financing costs associated with the portion of Atlas Energy's Term Loan Facility allocated to us in February 2015, a $6.1 million decrease in interest on outstanding term loans primarily resulting from lower outstanding borrowings and the refinancing of the Deutsche Bank Term Loan in 2015 to the Riverstone Term Loan Facilities in March 2016 that among other things decreased the interest rate by approximately 6% per annum, $3.2 million of discount amortization for Atlas Energy's Term Loan Facility allocated to us in the prior year period, $2.9 million of accelerated amortization of the discount of Atlas Energy's Term Loan Facility allocated to us resulting from repayments made to reduce the outstanding balance during the prior year period, $2.3 million of discount amortization for our Term Loan Facilities with Deutsche Bank during the year ended December 31, 2015, $0.5 million accelerated amortization\nassociated with a paydown of the Riverstone Term Loan and $0.3 million for amortization of our deferred financing costs in the prior year period, partially offset by the $11.7 million of paid-in-kind interest on our current Riverstone Credit Agreements and $0.6 million of amortization of warrants that were issued in connection with the Second Lien Credit Agreement. ARP's $33.3 million decrease interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year period is due to the deconsolidation of ARP as of July 27, 2016, which affects the comparability of the periods presented.\nGain (Loss) on Early Extinguishment of Debt. The decrease in our loss on early extinguishment of debt in the year ended December 31, 2017 was due to $3.7 million of accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs and $2.4 million of prepayment penalties related to the restructuring of our original term loans with Riverstone in the first quarter of 2016. ARP's $26.5 million decrease in gain on early extinguishment of debt was related to the repurchase of a portion of ARP's senior notes in the first quarter of 2016.\nReorganization Items, Net. The $21.6 million in ARP's reorganization items, net for the year ended December 31, 2016 represented incremental costs incurred as a result of ARP's Chapter 11 Filings.\nGain on deconsolidation of Atlas Resource Partners, L.P. As a result of deconsolidating ARP and recording our equity method investment in ARP at a fair value of zero on the date of the Chapter 11 Filings, we recognized a $47.0 million non-cash gain, which is recorded in gain on deconsolidation of ARP on our condensed combined consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOther income (loss). Our $6.9 million other income for the year ended December 31, 2017 represents a net gain on sale from the Lightfoot transaction. AGP's $5.3 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 was due to AGP's $5.3 million write-off of issuer costs related to its decision to suspend its primary offering efforts in light of new regulations and the challenging fund raising environment until such time as market participants have had an opportunity to ascertain the impact of such issues. ARP's $6.2 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 represents a non-cash loss, net of consolidation and transfer adjustments, of certain Drilling Partnerships' consolidation and transfer of oil and gas properties and asset retirement obligations to ARP during the period.\nLoss Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests. The decrease in loss attributable to non-controlling interests in the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the deconsolidation of ARP as of July 27, 2016, which affects the comparability of the periods presented.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nSee Liquidity and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\u201d section above for additional disclosures regarding our liquidity and financial condition.\nCash Flows\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nWe deconsolidated ARP for financial reporting purposes as of July 27, 2016 (the date of ARP's Chapter 11 Filings) and therefore our 2017 cash flows will not be comparable to our 2016 cash flows.\nCash Flows From Operating Activities:\nThe change in cash flows used in operating activities compared with the prior year period was due to:\n \u2022 a decrease from ARP's $243.5 million sale of substantially all of its commodity hedge positions on July 25, 2016 and July 26, 2016; \n \u2022 a decrease of $53.6 million of cash paid for interest related to ARP's debts due to the deconsolidation of ARP on the date of the Chapter 11 Filings; \n \u2022 a decrease of $36.7 million of investor capital raised transferred by ARP to the Atlas Eagle Ford 2015 L.P. private drilling partnership for activities directly related to their program in March of 2016; \n \u2022 a decrease of $20.4 million in distributions paid to non-controlling interests; and \n \u2022 a decrease of $1.8 million of cash paid for interest related to our credit agreements; partially offset by \n \u2022 an increase of $75.4 million net cash provided by operating activities for cash receipts and disbursements attributable to our normal monthly operating cycle for gas and oil production and ARP's Drilling partnership management revenue activities, and collections net of payments for our royalties, ARP's Drilling partnership management expense activities, lease operating expenses, gathering, processing and transportation expenses, severance taxes, and general and administrative expenses; and \n \u2022 a decrease of cash settlement receipts of $99.4 million on commodity derivative contracts. \nCash Flows From Investing Activities:\nThe change in cash flows used in investing activities when compared with the comparable prior year period was primarily due to a decrease of $27.7 million in capital expenditures related to ARP's and AGP's drilling activities, partially offset by $28.0 million net proceeds from the Lightfoot transaction and $3.3 million net cash paid for investment in Joliet.\nCash Flows From Financing Activities:\nThe change in cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities compared with the prior year period was due to:\n \u2022 a net decrease of $161.7 million due to the deconsolidation of ARP; \n \u2022 a $4.3 million decrease in net repayments on our original term loans with Riverstone; \n \u2022 a decrease of $4.1 million in deferred financing costs and discounts; \n \u2022 a decrease of $1.7 million in net proceeds primarily due to fees related to AGP's public offering in 2016; and \n \u2022 a decrease of $1.0 million in distributions paid to preferred unitholders primarily due to the suspension of distributions for the Series A preferred units in the first quarter of 2016; partially offset by; \n \u2022 a $21.6 million increase in repayments under our credit facilities. \nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nWe deconsolidated ARP for financial reporting purposes as of July 27, 2016 (the date of ARP's Chapter 11 Filings) and therefore our 2016 cash flows will not be comparable to our 2015 cash flows.\nThe change in cash flows provided by operating activities when compared with the comparable prior year period was primarily due to:\n \u2022 an increase of $243.5 million from the sale of substantially all of ARP's commodity hedge positions on July 25, 2016 and July 26, 2016 pursuant to ARP's Restructuring Support Agreement; and \n \u2022 a decrease of $96.3 million in distributions paid to non-controlling interests; partially offset by \n \u2022 a decrease of $65.1 million net cash provided by operating activities for cash receipts and disbursements attributable to our normal monthly operating cycle for gas and oil production and ARP's partnership management revenues, and collections net of payments for our royalties, ARP's well construction and completion activities, ARP's Drilling Partnership administrative and oversight and well services activities, lease operating expenses, ARP's gathering, processing and transportation expenses, severance taxes, general and administrative expenses, and interest payments; \n \u2022 a decrease of cash settlement receipts of $80.1 million on commodity derivative contracts; \n \u2022 an increase in ARP's reorganization costs of $21.6 million representing incremental costs incurred as a result of ARP's Chapter 11 Filings; and \n \u2022 a $1.0 million decrease in net cash distributions from our equity investment in Lightfoot. \nThe change in cash flows used in investing activities when compared with the comparable prior year period was primarily due to:\n \u2022 a decrease of $128.6 million in capital expenditures resulting from ARP's $106.0 million and AGP's $22.6 million in lower capital expenditures related to our drilling activities; and \n \u2022 a decrease of $120.3 million in net cash paid for acquisitions primarily due to ARP's $77.8 million and AGP's $42.5 million in deferred purchase price payments and working capital settlements for ARP's and AGP's Eagle Ford acquisition in 2015. \nThe change in cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities when compared with the comparable prior year period was primarily due to:\n \u2022 a decrease of $242.5 million in net borrowings under ARP's second lien term loan facility due to the second lien term loan proceeds of $242.5 million, net of $7.5 million in discount, issued early 2015; \n \u2022 a decrease of $200.4 million in net proceeds primarily from the issuance of $107.0 million of AGP's common limited partner units under its private placement offering during the year ended December 31, 2015 and the $93.4 million issuance of ARP's common limited partner units in the year ended December 31, 2015 under ARP's equity distribution program; \n \u2022 a $77.0 million decrease in net borrowings on our credit agreements with Riverstone; \n \u2022 an increase of $52.0 million in net repayments on ARP's revolving credit facilities; \n \u2022 a decrease of $40.0 million related to the issuance of our Series A preferred units during the year ended December 31, 2015; \n \u2022 a decrease of $6.8 million in net proceeds from the issuance of ARP's preferred limited partner units in the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily related to less funds required for acquisitions during 2015; and \n \u2022 a decrease of $5.5 million related to ARP's senior note repurchases in the first quarter of 2016; partially offset by \n \u2022 a $127.8 million decrease in net repayments on our Term Loan Facilities with Deutsche Bank, which was replaced with our First Lien Term Loan Facility with Riverstone in August 2015; \n \u2022 a decrease of $32.3 million in net repayments on Atlas Energy, LP's Term Loan Facility during the year ended December 31, 2016, resulting from our $148.1 million payment to Atlas Energy, LP in connection with Atlas Energy, LP's merger with Targa to repay the then existing Term Loan Facility in full in the first quarter of 2015, which was partially funded by the $115.8 million interim and term loan A facilities, net of $12.5 million of discount, entered into in the first quarter of 2015; \n \u2022 a decrease of $29.6 million in deferred financing costs and discounts on the second lien term loan, primarily related to the issuance of ARP's $250.0 million second lien term loan in the first quarter of 2015; \n \u2022 a decrease of $19.8 million of distributions to Atlas Energy related to the Arkoma transaction adjustment in the first quarter of 2015; and \n \u2022 a decrease of $1.7 million in distributions paid to preferred unitholders primarily due to the suspension of distributions for the Series A preferred units in the first quarter of 2015. \nCapital Requirements\nAt December 31, 2017, the capital requirements of our natural gas and oil production primarily consist of expenditures to maintain or increase production margin in future periods, as well as land, gathering and processing, and other non-drilling capital expenditures\nAs of December 31, 2017, our subsidiaries did not have any commitments for drilling and completion and capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions.\nOFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nAs of December 31, 2017, we did not have any off-balance sheet commitment arrangements for our drilling and completion and capital expenditures.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS\nThe following tables summarize our and our subsidiaries contractual obligations at December 31, 2017 (in thousands):\n\n (1) Interest expense on total debt includes our estimated cash and paid-in-kind interest for the next four months on our First Lien Credit Agreement and twelve months on our Second Lien Credit Agreement as both of our debts are classified as current liabilities. Actual interest expense may be different than our estimates depending upon the timing and outcome of transactions related to our debts. \nCREDIT FACILITIES\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had not guaranteed any of our subsidiaries' obligations or debt instruments.\nCredit Agreements\nFirst Lien Credit Agreement. On March 30, 2016, we, together with New Atlas Holdings, LLC (the Borrower\u201d) and Atlas Lightfoot, LLC, entered into a third amendment (the Third Amendment\u201d) to our credit agreement with Riverstone Credit Partners, L.P., as administrative agent ( Riverstone\u201d), and the lenders (the Lenders\u201d) from time to time party thereto (the First Lien Credit Agreement\u201d).\nThe outstanding loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement were bifurcated between the existing First Lien Credit Agreement and the new Second Lien Credit Agreement (defined below), with $35.0 million and $35.8 million (including $2.4 million in deemed prepayment premium) in borrowings outstanding, respectively. See Item 8: Financial Statement and Supplementary Data - Note 5 for additional disclosures regarding our First Lien Credit Agreement's terms and provisions.\nAs of December 31, 2017 we have $20.7 million of outstanding indebtedness under the First Lien Credit Agreement, which is scheduled to mature on June 30, 2018.\nSee Liquidity and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\u201d above for additional disclosures regarding our liquidity and financial condition.\nSecond Lien Credit Agreement. Also on March 30, 2016, we and the Borrower entered into a new second lien credit agreement (the Second Lien Credit Agreement\u201d) with Riverstone and the Lenders. As described above, $35.8 million of the indebtedness previously outstanding under the First Lien Credit Agreement was moved under the Second Lien Credit Agreement. The Second Lien Credit Agreement also has an unamortized discount of $0.9 million as of September 30, 2017, related to the 4,668,044 warrants", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7:\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a publicly traded (OTCQB: ATLS) Delaware limited liability company formed in October 2011.\nOur operations primarily consisted of our ownership interests in the following:\n \u2022 All of the incentive distribution rights, an 80.0% general partner interest and a 2.1% limited partner interest in Atlas Growth Partners, L.P. ( AGP\u201d), a Delaware limited partnership and an independent developer and producer of natural gas, crude oil and NGLs with operations primarily focused in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas; \n \u2022 A 12.0% limited partner interest in Lightfoot Capital Partners, L.P. ( Lightfoot L.P.\u201d) and a 15.9% general partner interest in Lightfoot Capital Partners GP, LLC ( Lightfoot G.P.\u201d and together with Lightfoot L.P., Lightfoot\u201d), the general partner of Lightfoot L.P., an entity for which Jonathan Cohen, Executive Chairman of the Company's board of directors, is the Chairman of the board of directors. Lightfoot focuses its investments primarily on incubating new MLPs and providing capital to existing MLPs in need of additional equity or structured debt. On August 29, 2017, Lightfoot announced a proposed sale transaction. Please see Recent Developments-Lightfoot Transactions\u201d for further disclosures regarding Lightfoot; \n \u2022 A membership interest in the founder shares of Osprey Sponsor, LLC ( Osprey Sponsor\u201d) received in August 2017. Osprey Sponsor is the sponsor of Osprey Energy Acquisition Corp ( Osprey\u201d). We received our membership interest in recognition of potential utilization, if any, of our office space, advisory services and personnel by Osprey. Please see Recent Developments - Osprey Sponsor Interest\u201d for further disclosures regarding Osprey; \n \u2022 Commencing September 1, 2016, Titan Energy, LLC ( Titan\u201d), an independent developer and producer of natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids ( NGL\u201d) with operations in basins across the United States but primarily focused on the horizontal development of resource potential from the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas. Titan Energy Management, LLC, our wholly owned subsidiary ( Titan Management\u201d), holds the Series A Preferred Share of Titan, which entitles us to receive 2% of the aggregate of distributions paid to shareholders (as if we held 2% of Titan's members' equity, subject to potential dilution in the event of future equity interests) and to appoint four of seven directors. Titan sponsors and manages tax-advantaged investment partnerships (the Drilling Partnerships\u201d), in which it coinvests, to finance a portion of its natural gas, crude oil and NGL production activities. As discussed further below, Titan is the successor to the business and operations of Atlas Resource Partners, L.P. ( ARP\u201d); \n \u2022 Through August 31, 2016, 100% of the general partner Class A units, all of the incentive distribution rights, and an approximate 23.3% limited partner interest in ARP. As discussed further below, ARP was the predecessor to the business and operations of Titan. \nOur cash flows and liquidity are substantially dependent upon AGP's annual management fee and distributions from AGP, Lightfoot, and Titan. Neither AGP nor Titan are currently paying distributions. Though we consolidate the operations of AGP (and, prior to July 27, 2016, we consolidated the operations of ARP) for financial reporting purposes, AGP's annual management fee and distributions from Lightfoot are currently our only sources of liquidity to satisfy our obligations under our credit agreements. In addition, Lightfoot completed a portion of its sale transaction that will result in lower quarterly distributions to us.\nWe used the net proceeds from the Lightfoot transaction to pay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our first lien credit agreement, the maturity of which was recently extended to June 30, 2018. As a result, we continue to face significant liquidity issues and are currently considering, and are likely to make, changes to our capital structure to maintain sufficient liquidity, meet our debt obligations and strengthen our balance sheet. Without a further extension or other significant transaction or capital infusion, we do not expect to have sufficient liquidity to repay our first lien credit agreement at maturity. Please see Liquidity and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\u201d for additional disclosures.\nLIQUIDITY AND ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash distributions received with respect to our ownership interests in AGP, Lightfoot, and Titan and AGP's annual management fee. However, neither Titan nor AGP is currently paying distributions. In addition, Lightfoot completed a portion of its sale transaction that will result in lower quarterly distributions to us. Our primary cash requirements, in addition to normal operating expenses, are for debt service and capital expenditures. In addition, the obligations under our first lien credit agreement mature in June 2018. Accordingly, our sources of liquidity are currently not sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our credit agreements.\nThe significant risks and uncertainties related to our primary sources of liquidity raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to remain in compliance with the covenants under our credit agreements, absent relief from our lenders, we may be forced to repay or refinance such indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lenders under our credit agreements could elect to declare all amounts outstanding immediately due and payable and could terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If an event of default occurs, we will not have sufficient liquidity to repay all of our outstanding indebtedness, and as a result, there would be substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOn April 26, 2018, we entered into an agreement with our lenders to extend the maturity date of our first lien credit agreement to June 30, 2018. In addition to the $20.7 million of indebtedness due on June 30, 2018, we classified the remaining $59.6 million of outstanding indebtedness under our credit agreements as a current liability, based on the uncertainty regarding future covenant compliance. In total, we have $79.4 million of outstanding indebtedness under our credit agreements, which is net of $0.8 million of debt discounts and $0.1 million of deferred financing costs, as current portion of long term debt, net within our combined consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017.\nWe continually monitor capital markets and may make changes from time to time to our capital structures, with the goal of maintaining financial flexibility, preserving or improving liquidity, strengthening the balance sheet, meeting debt service obligations and/or achieving cost efficiency. For example, we could pursue options such as refinancing or reorganizing our indebtedness or capital structure or seek to raise additional capital through debt or equity financing to address our liquidity concerns and high debt levels. There is no certainty that we will be able to implement any such options, and we cannot provide any assurances that any refinancing or changes to our debt or equity capital structure would be possible or that additional equity or debt financing could be obtained on acceptable terms, if at all, and such options may result in a wide range of outcomes for our stakeholders, including cancellation of debt income ( CODI\u201d) which would be directly allocated to our unitholders and reported on such unitholders' separate returns. It is possible additional adjustments to our strategic plan and outlook may occur based on market conditions and our needs at that time, which could include selling assets or seeking additional partners to develop our assets\nOur combined consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. Our combined consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the going concern uncertainty. If we cannot continue as a going concern, adjustments to the carrying values and classification of our assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses could be required and could be material.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nAGP Eagle Ford Drilling. AGP is deploying $6.5 million of cash on hand to drill and complete one Eagle Ford shale well, expected to be in-line during the second quarter of 2018. The well is expected to significantly increase AGP's production and provide substantial cash flow. The economics of drilling new oil wells across the AGP's acreage position in the Eagle Ford shale in South Texas have improved substantially over the last twelve months, driven by both a rise in oil prices, as well as significant advancements in drilling and completion technology.\nCredit Agreement Maturity Date Extensions. On April 26, 2018, we entered into an agreement with our lenders to extend the maturity date of our first lien credit agreement to June 30, 2018. See above Liquidity and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern section for further disclosures.\nLightfoot Transactions. On August 29, 2017, Lightfoot, announced a purchase agreement and plan of merger with Zenith Energy U.S., L.P. (together with its affiliates, Zenith\u201d), pursuant to which Zenith would acquire the general partner of Arc Logistics Partners, LP and all of the outstanding common units of Arc Logistics Partners, LP, a subsidiary of Lightfoot. On December 21, 2017 Lightfoot completed the first portion of this transaction, which resulted in net proceeds to us of $21.6 million. We used the net proceeds from this transaction to pay down $21.6 million of outstanding obligations\nunder our first lien credit agreement. The remaining second portion of this transaction is targeted to close in the second quarter 2018. We anticipate receiving additional net proceeds of approximately $3.0 million and plan to pay down outstanding obligations under our first lien credit agreement. See Item 8: Financial Statement and Supplementary Data - Note 2 for additional disclosures regarding the Lightfoot transactions.\nOsprey Sponsor Interest. In August 2017, we received a membership interest in Osprey Sponsor, which is the sponsor of Osprey. Osprey was formed for the purpose of acquiring, through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or other similar business transaction, one or more operating businesses or assets (a Business Combination\u201d) that Osprey has not yet identified. Our membership interest in Osprey Sponsor is an allocation of 1,250,000 founder shares, consisting of 1,250,000 shares of Class B common stock of Osprey that are automatically convertible into Class A common stock of Osprey upon the consummation of a business combination on a one-for-one basis. There can be no certainty, however, that Osprey will consummate a business combination transaction or that we will ultimately experience any value from our interest in Osprey. See Item 8: Financial Statement and Supplementary Data - Note 2 for additional disclosures regarding our Osprey Sponsor Interest.\nFINANCIAL PRESENTATION\nOur combined consolidated financial statements contain our accounts and those of our combined consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017. We determined that ARP (through the Plan Effective Date, as discussed further below) and AGP are variable interest entities ( VIE's\u201d) based on their respective partnership agreements, our power, as the general partner, to direct the activities that most significantly impact each of their respective economic performance, and our ownership of each of their respective incentive distribution rights. Accordingly, we consolidated the financial statements of ARP (until the date of ARP's Chapter 11 Filings, as discussed further below) and AGP into our combined consolidated financial statements. As the general partner for both ARP (through the Plan Effective Date) and AGP, we have unlimited liability for the obligations of ARP (through the Plan Effective Date) and AGP except for those contractual obligations that are expressly made without recourse to the general partner. The non-controlling interests in ARP (through the date of ARP's Chapter 11 Filings, as discussed further below) and AGP are reflected as (income) loss attributable to non-controlling interests in the combined consolidated statements of operations and as a component of unitholders' equity on the combined consolidated balance sheets. All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated.\nThroughout this section, when we refer to our\u201d combined consolidated financial statements, we are referring to the combined consolidated results for us, our wholly-owned subsidiaries and the consolidated results of ARP (as applicable) and AGP, adjusted for non-controlling interests in ARP and AGP.\nARP Restructuring, Emergence from Chapter 11 Proceedings, and VIE Considerations\nOn July 25, 2016, we, solely with respect to certain sections thereof, along with ARP and certain of its subsidiaries, entered into a restructuring support Agreement with certain of ARP's and such subsidiaries' lenders to support ARP's restructuring pursuant to a pre-packaged plan of reorganization (the Plan\u201d).\nOn July 27, 2016, ARP and certain of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court,\u201d and the cases commenced thereby, the Chapter 11 Filings\u201d). The cases commenced thereby were jointly administered under the caption In re: ATLAS RESOURCE PARTNERS, L.P., et al.\u201d\nOn August 26, 2016, an order confirming the Plan was entered by the Bankruptcy Court. On September 1, 2016, (the Plan Effective Date\u201d), pursuant to the Plan, Titan emerged.\nIn connection with ARP's Chapter 11 Filings on July 27, 2016, we deconsolidated ARP's financial statements from our combined consolidated financial statements, as we no longer had the power to direct the activities that most significantly impacted ARP's economic performance; however, we retained the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial decisions of ARP and therefore applied the equity method of accounting for our investment in ARP up to the Plan Effective Date. As a result of these changes, our combined consolidated financial statements subsequent to ARP's Chapter 11 Filings will not be comparable to our combined consolidated financial statements prior to ARP's Chapter 11 Filings. Our financial results for future periods following the application of equity method accounting will be different from historical trends and the differences may be material.\nOn the Plan Effective Date, we determined that Titan is a VIE based on its limited liability company agreement and the delegation of management and omnibus agreements between Titan and Titan Management, which provide us the power to direct activities that most significantly impact Titan's economic performance, but we do not have a controlling financial\ninterest. As a result, we do not consolidate Titan but rather apply the equity method of accounting as we have the ability to exercise significant influence over Titan's operating and financial decisions.\nGENERAL TRENDS AND OUTLOOK\nWe expect our business to be affected by key trends in natural gas and oil production markets. Our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us. To the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from our expected results.\nThroughout 2017, the natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids commodity price markets were marked by volatility. While we anticipate continued high levels of exploration and production activities over the long-term in the areas in which we operate, fluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect production rates and investments in the development of new natural gas, oil and NGL reserves. The economics of drilling new oil wells across the our acreage position in the Eagle Ford shale in South Texas have improved substantially over the last twelve months, driven by both a rise in oil prices, as well as significant advancements in drilling and completion technology.\nAGP's future gas and oil reserves, production, cash flow, ability to make payments on our obligations and our ability to make distributions to their unitholders, depend on its success in producing our current reserves efficiently, developing its existing acreage and acquiring additional proved reserves economically. We face the challenge of natural production declines and volatile natural gas, oil and NGL prices. As initial reservoir pressures are depleted, natural gas and oil production from particular wells decrease. We attempt to overcome this natural decline by drilling to find additional reserves and acquiring more reserves than we produce. To the extent we would not have access to sufficient capital, our ability to drill and acquire more reserves would be negatively impacted.\nFor additional information, please see Liquidity and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.\u201d\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGas and Oil Production\nWe deconsolidated ARP for financial reporting purposes as of the date of the Chapter 11 Filings and therefore our 2016 combined consolidated financial statements will not be comparable to our 2017 and 2015 combined consolidated financial statements.\nProduction Profile. Currently, our gas and oil production revenues and expenses consist of our gas and oil production activities derived from our wells drilled in the Eagle Ford, Marble Falls and Mississippi Lime plays. We have established production positions in the following operating areas:\n \u2022 the Eagle Ford Shale in southern Texas, an oil-rich area, in which we acquired acreage in November 2014, where we derive over 92% of our production volumes and 96% of our revenues; \n \u2022 the Marble Falls play in the Fort Worth Basin in northern Texas, in which we own acreage and producing wells, which contains liquids rich natural gas and oil, and; \n \u2022 the Mississippi Lime play in northwestern Oklahoma, an oil and NGL-rich area. \nProduction Volumes. The following table presents total net natural gas, crude oil and NGL production volumes and production per day for the periods indicated:\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years

Derivatives. We recognize changes in the fair value of derivatives immediately within gain (loss) on mark-to-market derivatives on our combined consolidated statements of operations. The recognized gains during the year ended December 31, 2017 were due to changes in commodity futures prices relative to our derivative positions as of the respective prior period end. The recognized losses and gains during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were related to the changes in oil prices during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 as compared to the prior year periods. In addition, we deconsolidated ARP as of July 27, 2016 which affects the comparability of the periods presented.\nGeneral and Administrative. Our $5.0 million decrease in general and administrative expenses in the year ended December 31, 2017, was due to a $5.1 million decrease in stock compensation expense related to the forfeiture of employee awards due to Titan's completion of the majority of sale of its Appalachian assets and reductions in workforce and a $0.7 million decrease in non-recurring transaction costs, partially offset by a $0.7 million increase in salaries and wages and a $0.2 million increase in other corporate activities. ARP's $41.0 million decrease in general and administrative expenses in year ended December 31, 2017 was due to our deconsolidation of ARP as of July 27, 2016, which affects the comparability of the periods presented. AGP's decrease in general and administrative expenses in the year ended December 31, 2017 was due to a $5.0 million decrease in salaries, wages and other corporate activity costs allocated to us as a result of the suspension of our current primary offering efforts and management's plan to reduce general and administrative expenses.\nOur $25.3 million decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to a $17.1 million decrease in non-recurring transaction costs attributable to our spin-off from Atlas Energy during the prior year period, a $6.2 million decrease in salaries, wages and benefits, a $1.3 million decrease in other corporate activities and a $0.7 million increase in stock compensation expense. ARP's $25.0 million decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year period is due to the deconsolidation of ARP as of July 27, 2016, which affects the comparability of the periods presented. AGP's decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year period was due to a $2.8 million decrease in salaries, wages and other corporate activity costs allocated by us and ARP/Titan to AGP in connection with the completion of AGP's private placement offering in June 2015.\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization. ARP's decrease in depreciation, depletion and amortization in the current year ended December 31, 2017 was due to our deconsolidation of ARP as of July 27, 2016, which affects the comparability of the periods presented. AGP's decrease in depreciation, depletion and amortization for the current year as compared to the prior year was primarily due to a $11.3 million decrease in its depletion expense resulting from the asset impairments recorded in the 4th quarter of 2016, which lowered our depletable base, and lower production volumes.\nARP's decrease in depletion expense and depletion expense per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year period was due to the deconsolidation of ARP as of July 27, 2016, which affects the comparability of the periods presented. AGP's increases in depletion expense, depletion expenses as a percentage of gas and oil revenues and depletion expenses per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year period were primarily due to an increase in AGP's depletion expense associated with the expansion of AGP's Eagle Ford operations, partially offset by a decrease in oil volumes from AGP's Marble Falls operations.\nAsset Impairment. For the year ended December 31, 2016, AGP recognized $25.4 million and $16.5 million of asset impairment related to its proved and unproved oil and gas properties in the Eagle Ford operating area, respectively, which were impaired due to lower forecasted commodity prices and timing of capital financing and deployment for the development of our undeveloped properties. For the year ended December 31, 2015, AGP recognized $7.3 million of asset impairment related to its proved oil and gas properties in the Marble Falls and Mississippi Lime operating areas, which were impaired due to lower forecasted commodity prices. ARP's $966.6 million of asset impairment for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to oil and gas properties in the Barnett, Coal-bed Methane, Rangely, Southern Appalachia, Marcellus and Mississippi Lime operating areas, which were impaired due to lower forecasted commodity prices, net of $85.8 million of future hedge gains reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income.\nInterest Expense. The increase in our interest expense in year ended December 31, 2017 consisted of a $7.6 million increase of paid-in-kind interest on our credit agreements, partially offset by a $1.1 million decrease in interest on the original term loans with Riverstone and a $0.3 million decrease in amortization of our deferred financing costs. ARP's $68.9 million decrease in interest expense in the year ended December 31, 2017 was due to our deconsolidation of ARP as of July 27, 2016, which affects the comparability of the periods presented.\nThe decrease in our interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year period consisted of $5.7 million of accelerated amortization of the deferred financing costs associated with the portion of Atlas Energy's Term Loan Facility allocated to us in February 2015, a $6.1 million decrease in interest on outstanding term loans primarily resulting from lower outstanding borrowings and the refinancing of the Deutsche Bank Term Loan in 2015 to the Riverstone Term Loan Facilities in March 2016 that among other things decreased the interest rate by approximately 6% per annum, $3.2 million of discount amortization for Atlas Energy's Term Loan Facility allocated to us in the prior year period, $2.9 million of accelerated amortization of the discount of Atlas Energy's Term Loan Facility allocated to us resulting from repayments made to reduce the outstanding balance during the prior year period, $2.3 million of discount amortization for our Term Loan Facilities with Deutsche Bank during the year ended December 31, 2015, $0.5 million accelerated amortization\nassociated with a paydown of the Riverstone Term Loan and $0.3 million for amortization of our deferred financing costs in the prior year period, partially offset by the $11.7 million of paid-in-kind interest on our current Riverstone Credit Agreements and $0.6 million of amortization of warrants that were issued in connection with the Second Lien Credit Agreement. ARP's $33.3 million decrease interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year period is due to the deconsolidation of ARP as of July 27, 2016, which affects the comparability of the periods presented.\nGain (Loss) on Early Extinguishment of Debt. The decrease in our loss on early extinguishment of debt in the year ended December 31, 2017 was due to $3.7 million of accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs and $2.4 million of prepayment penalties related to the restructuring of our original term loans with Riverstone in the first quarter of 2016. ARP's $26.5 million decrease in gain on early extinguishment of debt was related to the repurchase of a portion of ARP's senior notes in the first quarter of 2016.\nReorganization Items, Net. The $21.6 million in ARP's reorganization items, net for the year ended December 31, 2016 represented incremental costs incurred as a result of ARP's Chapter 11 Filings.\nGain on deconsolidation of Atlas Resource Partners, L.P. As a result of deconsolidating ARP and recording our equity method investment in ARP at a fair value of zero on the date of the Chapter 11 Filings, we recognized a $47.0 million non-cash gain, which is recorded in gain on deconsolidation of ARP on our condensed combined consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOther income (loss). Our $6.9 million other income for the year ended December 31, 2017 represents a net gain on sale from the Lightfoot transaction. AGP's $5.3 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 was due to AGP's $5.3 million write-off of issuer costs related to its decision to suspend its primary offering efforts in light of new regulations and the challenging fund raising environment until such time as market participants have had an opportunity to ascertain the impact of such issues. ARP's $6.2 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 represents a non-cash loss, net of consolidation and transfer adjustments, of certain Drilling Partnerships' consolidation and transfer of oil and gas properties and asset retirement obligations to ARP during the period.\nLoss Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests. The decrease in loss attributable to non-controlling interests in the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the deconsolidation of ARP as of July 27, 2016, which affects the comparability of the periods presented.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nSee Liquidity and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\u201d section above for additional disclosures regarding our liquidity and financial condition.\nCash Flows\nTable 186: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities............\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,102\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 179,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities.....................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (28,913\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (277,915\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities............\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21,647\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (169,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 243,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nWe deconsolidated ARP for financial reporting purposes as of July 27, 2016 (the date of ARP's Chapter 11 Filings) and therefore our 2017 cash flows will not be comparable to our 2016 cash flows.\nCash Flows From Operating Activities:\nThe change in cash flows used in operating activities compared with the prior year period was due to:\n \u2022 a decrease from ARP's $243.5 million sale of substantially all of its commodity hedge positions on July 25, 2016 and July 26, 2016; \n \u2022 a decrease of $53.6 million of cash paid for interest related to ARP's debts due to the deconsolidation of ARP on the date of the Chapter 11 Filings; \n \u2022 a decrease of $36.7 million of investor capital raised transferred by ARP to the Atlas Eagle Ford 2015 L.P. private drilling partnership for activities directly related to their program in March of 2016;

and \n \u2022 a decrease of cash settlement receipts of $99.4 million on commodity derivative contracts. \nCash Flows From Investing Activities:\nThe change in cash flows used in investing activities when compared with the comparable prior year period was primarily due to a decrease of $27.7 million in capital expenditures related to ARP's and AGP's drilling activities, partially offset by $28.0 million net proceeds from the Lightfoot transaction and $3.3 million net cash paid for investment in Joliet.\nCash Flows From Financing Activities:\nThe change in cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities compared with the prior year period was due to:\n \u2022 a net decrease of $161.7 million due to the deconsolidation of ARP; \n \u2022 a $4.3 million decrease in net repayments on our original term loans with Riverstone; \n \u2022 a decrease of $4.1 million in deferred financing costs and discounts; \n \u2022 a decrease of $1.7 million in net proceeds primarily due to fees related to AGP's public offering in 2016;

partially offset by; \n \u2022 a $21.6 million increase in repayments under our credit facilities. \nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nWe deconsolidated ARP for financial reporting purposes as of July 27, 2016 (the date of ARP's Chapter 11 Filings) and therefore our 2016 cash flows will not be comparable to our 2015 cash flows.\nThe change in cash flows provided by operating activities when compared with the comparable prior year period was primarily due to:\n \u2022 an increase of $243.5 million from the sale of substantially all of ARP's commodity hedge positions on July 25, 2016 and July 26, 2016 pursuant to ARP's Restructuring Support Agreement; and \n \u2022 a decrease of $96.3 million in distributions paid to non-controlling interests; partially offset by \n \u2022 a decrease of $65.1 million net cash provided by operating activities for cash receipts and disbursements attributable to our normal monthly operating cycle for gas and oil production and ARP's partnership management revenues, and collections net of payments for our royalties, ARP's well construction and completion activities, ARP's Drilling Partnership administrative and oversight and well services activities, lease operating expenses, ARP's gathering, processing and transportation expenses, severance taxes, general and administrative expenses, and interest payments; \n \u2022 a decrease of cash settlement receipts of $80.1 million on commodity derivative contracts; \n \u2022 an increase in ARP's reorganization costs of $21.6 million representing incremental costs incurred as a result of ARP's Chapter 11 Filings; and \n \u2022 a $1.0 million decrease in net cash distributions from our equity investment in Lightfoot. \nThe change in cash flows used in investing activities when compared with the comparable prior year period was primarily due to:\n \u2022 a decrease of $128.6 million in capital expenditures resulting from ARP's $106.0 million and AGP's $22.6 million in lower capital expenditures related to our drilling activities; and \n \u2022 a decrease of $120.3 million in net cash paid for acquisitions primarily due to ARP's $77.8 million and AGP's $42.5 million in deferred purchase price payments and working capital settlements for ARP's and AGP's Eagle Ford acquisition in 2015. \nThe change in cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities when compared with the comparable prior year period was primarily due to:\n \u2022 a decrease of $242.5 million in net borrowings under ARP's second lien term loan facility due to the second lien term loan proceeds of $242.5 million, net of $7.5 million in discount, issued early 2015; \n \u2022 a decrease of $200.4 million in net proceeds primarily from the issuance of $107.0 million of AGP's common limited partner units under its private placement offering during the year ended December 31, 2015 and the $93.4 million issuance of ARP's common limited partner units in the year ended December 31, 2015 under ARP's equity distribution program;

\n \u2022 a decrease of $32.3 million in net repayments on Atlas Energy, LP's Term Loan Facility during the year ended December 31, 2016, resulting from our $148.1 million payment to Atlas Energy, LP in connection with Atlas Energy, LP's merger with Targa to repay the then existing Term Loan Facility in full in the first quarter of 2015, which was partially funded by the $115.8 million interim and term loan A facilities, net of $12.5 million of discount, entered into in the first quarter of 2015;
