Although we believe the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee these expectations will actually be achieved. In addition, some forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expected or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement for any reason, even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future. There may be additional risks we do not currently view as material or that are not presently known. In evaluating these statements, you should consider various factors, including the risks set forth in the section entitled Risk Factors.\u201d\nKey Transactions and Events\nWe were impacted by the following key transactions and events in 2018 that may affect comparability of our results to 2017 and other periods:\nYear ended December 31, 2018:\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Effective January 1, 2018, we changed our organizational structure in an effort to create more effective and efficient operations and to improve client and service focus. As a result, beginning January 1, 2018, we report our financial performance based on our new reportable segments PFS Operations and LiveArea Professional Services. All prior period segment information has been restated to conform with the 2018 presentation. The changes in the reportable segments have no effect on the consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) or cash flows for the periods presented.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We adopted Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606\u201d) on January 1, 2018.

Under the modified retrospective method, the cumulative effect of applying the new standard was recorded at January 1, 2018 for open contracts. Therefore, results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 may not be comparable.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverview\nWe are a global commerce solutions company. We manage the entire customer shopping experience for major branded manufacturers and retailers through two business segments, LiveArea Professional Services and PFS Operations. The LiveArea Professional Services segment provides services to support and improve the digital shopping experience of shopping online, such as strategic commerce consulting, strategy, design and digital marketing services and technology services. The PFS Operations segment provides services to support and improve the physical experience, such as order management, order fulfillment, customer care and payment services. We offer our services on an a la carte basis or as a complete end-to-end solution.\nService Fee Model. We refer to our standard seller services financial model as the Service Fee model. In this model, our clients own the inventory and are the merchants of record and engage us to provide various infrastructure, technology and digital agency services in support of their business operations. We offer our services as an integrated solution, which enables our clients to outsource their complete eCommerce needs to a single source and to focus on their core competencies, though clients are also able to select individual or groupings of our various service offerings on an \u00e0 la carte basis. We currently provide services to clients that operate in a range of vertical markets, including technology manufacturing, computer products, cosmetics, fragile goods, coins and collectibles, apparel, telecommunications, consumer electronics and consumer packaged goods, among others.\nIn the Service Fee model, we typically charge for our services on time and material basis, a cost-plus basis, a percent of shipped revenue basis, a time and materials, project or retainer basis for our professional services or a per transaction basis, such as a per labor hour basis for web-enabled customer contact center services and a per-item basis for fulfillment services. Additional fees are billed for other services. We price our services based on a variety of factors, including the depth and complexity of the services provided, the amount of capital expenditures or systems customization required, the length of contract and other factors.\nMany of our service fee contracts involve third-party vendors who provide additional services, such as package delivery. The costs we are charged by these third-party vendors for these services are often passed on to our clients. Our billings for reimbursements of these costs and other \u2018out-of-pocket' expenses include travel, shipping and handling costs and telecommunication charges and are included in pass-through revenue.\nAgent (Flash) Model. In our PFS Operations business unit, as an additional service, we offer the Agent, or Flash, financial model, in which our clients maintain ownership of the product inventory stored at our locations as in the Service Fee model. When a customer orders the product from our clients, a flash\u201d sale transaction passes product ownership to us for each order and we in turn immediately re-sell the product to the customer. The flash\u201d ownership exchange establishes us as the merchant of record, which enables us to use our existing merchant infrastructure to process sales to end customers, removing the need for the clients to establish these business processes internally, but permitting them to control the sales process to end customers. In this model, based on the terms of our current client arrangements, we record product revenue net of cost of product revenue as a component of service fee revenue in our consolidated statement of operations.\nRetail Model. Our PFS Operations business unit also provides a Retail model which allows us to purchase inventory from the client. We place the initial and replenishment purchase orders with the client and take ownership of the product either upon shipment to or delivery to our facility. In this model, depending on the terms of our client arrangements, we may own the inventory and the accounts receivable arising from our product sales. Under the Retail model, depending upon the product category and sales characteristics, we may require the client to provide product price protection as well as product purchase payment terms, right of return, and obsolescence protection appropriate to the product sales profile. Depending on the terms of our client arrangements in the Retail model, we record in our consolidated statement of operations either: 1) product revenue as a component of product revenue, or 2) product revenue net of cost of product revenue as a component of service fee revenue. In general, we seek to structure client relationships in our Retail model under the net revenue approach to more closely align with our service fee revenue financial presentation and mitigate inventory ownership risk, although we have one client still operating under the gross revenue approach. Freight costs billed to customers are reflected as components of product revenue. This business model generally requires significant working capital, for which we have credit available either through credit terms provided by our clients or under senior credit facilities.\nCurrently, we are targeting growth within our Retail model to be through relationships with clients under which we can record service fee revenue in our consolidated statement of operations. These relationships are often driven by the sales and marketing efforts of the manufacturers and third party sales partners. In addition, as a result of certain operational restructuring of its business, our primary client relationship operating in the Retail model, Ricoh, has implemented, and will continue to implement, certain changes in the sale and distribution of Ricoh products. The changes have resulted, and are expected to continue to result, in reduced product revenues and profitability under our Retail model.\nGrowth is a key element to achieving our future goals, including achieving and maintaining sustainable profitability. Growth in our company is driven by two main elements: new client relationships and organic growth from existing clients. Within our LiveArea Professional Services segment, we focus our sales efforts on engaging with brands, retailers and manufacturers to perform discrete projects such as website design, platform selection and platform implementation and system integration projects. We also focus our LiveArea sales efforts on engaging with brands, retailers and manufacturers to provide ongoing services such as digital marketing retainers and technology managed services engagements. Within our PFS Operations segment, we focus our sales efforts on larger contracts with brand-name companies within four primary target markets, health and beauty, home goods and collectibles, fashion, and consumer packaged goods. Consumer packaged goods require a longer duration to close but also have the potential to be higher quality and longer duration engagements. Within both segments, we focus our sales efforts on both new clients and also on existing clients where we believe opportunity exists to expand a client relationship to include additional services within the segment, across segments and/or across multiple geographies. We continue to monitor and control our costs to focus on profitability. While we are targeting our new service fee contracts to yield incremental gross profit, we also expect to incur incremental investments in technology development, operational and support management and sales and marketing expenses to help generate growth.\nOur expenses comprise primarily four categories: 1) cost of service fee revenue, 2) cost of product revenue, 3) cost of pass-through revenue and 4) selling, general and administrative expenses.\nCost of service fee revenue - consists primarily of compensation and related expenses for our web-enabled customer contact center services, international fulfillment and distribution services and professional, digital agency and technology services, and other fixed and variable expenses directly related to providing services under the terms of fee based contracts, including certain occupancy and information technology costs and depreciation and amortization expenses.\nCost of product revenue - consists of the purchase price of product sold and freight costs, which are reduced by certain reimbursable expenses. These reimbursable expenses include pass-through customer marketing programs, direct costs incurred in passing on any price decreases offered by vendors to cover price protection and certain special bids, the cost of products provided to replace defective product returned by customers and certain other expenses as defined under the distributor agreements.\nCost of pass-through revenue - the related reimbursable costs for pass-through expenditures are reflected as cost of pass-through revenue.\nSelling, General and Administrative expenses - consist of expenses such as compensation and related expenses for sales and marketing staff, distribution costs (excluding freight) applicable to the Agent and the Retail model, executive, management and administrative personnel and other overhead costs, including certain occupancy and information technology costs, and depreciation and amortization expenses and acquisition related, restructuring and other costs.\nMonitoring and controlling our available cash balances and our expenses continues to be a primary focus. Our cash and liquidity positions are important components of our financing of both current operations and our targeted growth.\nOperating Results\nThe following table discloses certain financial

ended December 31, 2018 increased by $4.9 million compared with the corresponding period in 2017. Service fee revenue increased by $2.4 million due to new and expanded client relationships, partially offset by the impact of client terminations, including the termination of certain lower-margin engagements. Product revenue, net, decreased by $6.3 million due to the revenue stream being primarily dependent on one client, which restructured its operations and discontinued certain product lines which has resulted, and is expected to continue to result, in reduced product revenue activity. Pass-through revenue increased primarily as a result of freight related activity.\nPFS Operations gross margin improved to 18.4% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 15.7% in the same period of the prior year primarily due to improved operational efficiency through enhanced warehouse technology capabilities, focus on higher margin service offerings, including project work, and the termination of certain lower margin client engagements, which did not meet our profitability objectives and were discontinued.\nDirect operating expenses increased by $4.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to the corresponding period in 2017.

Excluding these expenses, unallocated corporate expenses increased by $0.3 million.\nIncome Taxes\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a tax provision comprised primarily of $1.7 million related to the majority of our international operations, $0.6 million related to state income taxes, and $0.5 million associated with the tax amortization of goodwill relation to our CrossView acquisition. A valuation allowance has been provided for the majority of our domestic net deferred tax assets, which are primarily related to our net operating loss carryforwards, and for certain foreign deferred tax assets.\nOn December 22, 2017, the United States government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, commonly referred to as the Tax Reform Act. The Tax Reform Act included significant changes to the U.S. income tax system, including, but not limited to: a federal corporate rate reduction from 35% to 21%; limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation; repeal of the Alternative Minimum Tax ( AMT\u201d); full expensing provisions related to business assets; creation of new minimum taxes, such as the base erosion anti-abuse tax ( BEAT\u201d) and Global Intangible Low Taxed Income ( GILTI\u201d) tax; and the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax system, which resulted in a one-time U.S. tax liability on those earnings which have not previously been repatriated to the U.S. (the Transition Tax\u201d). The impacts of this legislation are outlined below:\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Beginning January 1, 2018, the U.S. corporate income tax rate is 21%.

At December 31, 2017, we remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%. The amount related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax balance was $12.1 million that was mostly offset by a change in the valuation allowance, except for a $0.6 million benefit that was recorded to our statement of operations related to tax amortization of goodwill for the period ended December 31, 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The Transition Tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings is a tax on previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits (\"E&P\") of the Company's foreign subsidiaries.

Based on the Company's analysis of the transition tax, there were no provisional amounts recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Under U.S. GAAP, the Company is permitted to make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on future inclusions in U.S. taxable income related to GILTI as a current period expense when incurred or to factor such amounts into the Company's measurement of its deferred taxes. The Company has a GILTI inclusion in taxable income of $0.6 million which has been considered in the tax provision for the period ended December 31, 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe currently believe our cash position, financing available under our credit facilities and funds generated from operations will satisfy our presently known operating cash needs, our working capital and capital expenditure requirements, our current debt and lease obligations, and additional loans to our subsidiaries, if necessary, for at least the next twelve months.\nTo obtain additional financing in the future, in addition to our current cash position, we plan to evaluate various financing alternatives including the sale of equity, utilizing capital or operating leases, borrowing under our credit facilities, expanding our current credit facilities or entering into new debt agreements. No assurances can be given we will be successful in obtaining any additional financing or the terms thereof.\nOur cash position decreased in 2018 primarily due to payments made applicable to capital expenditures, acquisition-related contingencies and debt obligations, all of which combined exceeded our cash generated from operations.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nDuring 2018, cash provided from operations was $11.6 million, compared to $11.1 million in 2017. Cash flow from operating activities increased primarily due to improvements in net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities included capital expenditures of $4.9 million and $4.6 million in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, exclusive of property and equipment acquired under debt and capital lease financing, which consisted primarily of capitalized software costs and equipment purchases.\nCapital expenditures have historically consisted of additions to upgrade our management information systems, development of customized technology solutions to support and integrate with our service fee clients and general expansion and upgrades to our facilities, both domestic and foreign. We expect to incur capital expenditures to support new contracts and anticipated future growth opportunities. Based on our current client business activity and our targeted growth plans, we anticipate our total investment in upgrades and additions to facilities and information technology solutions and services for the upcoming twelve months, including costs to implement new clients, will be approximately $7.0 million to $10.0 million, although additional capital expenditures may be necessary to support the infrastructure requirements of new clients. To maintain our current operating cash position, a portion of these expenditures may be financed through client reimbursements, debt, operating or capital leases or additional equity. We may elect to\nmodify or defer a portion of such anticipated investments in the event that we do not obtain the financing results necessary to support such investments.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nDuring 2018, cash used in financing activities was $9.9 million, compared to $14.7 million in 2017. In both years, the cash used in financing activity was primarily related to the paydown of debt and capital lease obligations as well as the payout of performance-based contingent payments related to our prior year acquisitions.\nWorking Capital\nDuring 2018, our working capital increased to $22.9 million from $13.7 million at December 31, 2017, primarily related to income generated from operations before working capital changes, the refinancing of our U.S. Credit Agreement, which decreased the current portion of our long-term debt, and the reduction of our performance based contingent payment partially offset by capital expenditures and the reductions of our capital lease obligations.\nInventory Financing\nTo finance its distribution of Ricoh products in the U.S., Supplies Distributors has a short-term credit facility with IBM Credit LLC ( IBM Credit\u201d) that provides financing for eligible inventory and certain receivables for up to $11.0 million. We have provided a collateralized guarantee to secure the repayment of this credit facility. The IBM Credit facility does not have a stated maturity and both parties have the ability to exit the facility following a 90-day notice.\nThis credit facility contains various restrictions upon the ability of Supplies Distributors and its subsidiaries to, among other things, merge, consolidate, sell assets, incur indebtedness, make loans, investments and payments to related parties (including entities directly or indirectly owned by PFSweb, Inc.), provide guarantees, make investments and loans, pledge assets, make changes to capital stock ownership structure and pay dividends, as well as financial covenants, such as annualized revenue to working capital, net profit after tax to revenue and total liabilities to tangible net worth, as defined, and are secured by all of the assets of Supplies Distributors, as well as a collateralized guaranty of PFSweb. Additionally, we are required to maintain a subordinated loan to Supplies Distributors of no less than $1.0 million, not maintain restricted cash of more than $5.0 million, are restricted with regard to transactions with related parties, indebtedness and changes to capital stock ownership. Furthermore, we are obligated to repay any over-advance made to Supplies Distributors or its subsidiaries under these facilities if they are unable to do so. We have also provided a guarantee of substantially all of the obligations of Supplies Distributors and its subsidiaries to IBM and Ricoh.\nDebt and Capital Lease Obligations\nU.S. Credit Agreement. In August 2015, we entered into a credit agreement ( Credit Agreement\u201d) with Regions Bank, as agent for itself and one or more future lenders (the Lenders\u201d). Under the Credit Agreement, and subject to the terms set forth therein, the Lenders provided us with a revolving loan facility for up to $32.5 million and a term loan facility for up to $30 million. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement accrued interest at a variable rate based on prime rate or Libor, plus an applicable margin.\nOn November 1, 2018, we entered into Amendment No.1 to our credit agreement with Regions Bank (the Amended Facility\u201d). The Amended Facility provides for an increase in availability of our revolving loans to $60.0 million, with the ability for a further increase of $20.0 million to $80.0 million, and the elimination of the term loan. Amounts outstanding under the term loan were reconstituted as revolving loans. The Amended Facility also extends the maturity date to November 1, 2023.\nIn accordance with ASC 470, Debt ( ASC 470\u201d), we recorded a $0.1 million loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2018 related to the Amended Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the weighted average interest rate on the revolving loan facility was 4.57% and 4.65%, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, the weighted average interest rate on the term loan facility was 4.05%. In connection with the Amended Facility, the Company paid $0.3 million of fees, which are being amortized through the life of the Amended Facility and are reflected as a net reduction in debt. The Amended Facility is secured by a lien on substantially all of the operating assets of the US entities and a pledge of 65% of the shares of certain of our foreign subsidiaries. The Amended Facility contains cross default provisions, various restrictions upon the Company's ability to, among other things, merge, consolidate, sell assets, incur indebtedness, make loans and payments to subsidiaries, affiliates and related parties, make capital expenditures, make investments and loans, pledge assets, make changes to capital stock ownership structure, as well as financial covenants, as defined, of a minimum consolidated fixed charge ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio.\nMaster Lease Agreements. The Company has various agreements that provide for leasing or financing transactions of equipment and other assets and will continue to enter into such arrangements as needed to finance the purchasing or leasing of certain equipment or other assets. Borrowings under these agreements, which generally have terms of three to five years, are generally secured by the related equipment, and in certain cases, by a Company parent guarantee.\nOther than our capital and operating lease commitments, we do not have any other material financial commitments, although future client contracts may require capital expenditures and lease commitments to support the services provided to such clients.\nDebt Covenants\nCertain of our credit facilities contain various financial and non-financial covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, create or permit liens on assets, engage in mergers or consolidations, and place restrictions on the transfer of assets or the payment of dividends between us and our subsidiaries.\nTo the extent we fail to comply with our debt covenants, including the financial covenant requirements and we are not able to obtain a waiver, the lenders would be entitled to accelerate the repayment of any outstanding credit facility obligations, and exercise all other rights and remedies, including sale of collateral. An acceleration of the repayment of our credit facility obligations may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We can provide no assurance we will have the financial ability to repay all such obligations. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all debt covenants. Further, non-renewal of any of our credit facilities may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThere are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements for our discussion about new accounting pronouncements adopted and those pending.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different, application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. If there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions, it could result in a material adverse impact to our business, operating results and financial condition. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. All of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe have defined a critical accounting estimate as one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates about matters that are uncertain. During the past two years, we have not made any material changes in accounting methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates discussed below. The following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates. In addition, there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive revenue primarily from services provided under contractual arrangements with our clients or from the sale of products under our distributor agreements. We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 606, when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our clients and customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services.\nWe will often enter into contracts with clients and customers that contain multiple promises to transfer control of multiple products and/or services. To the extent a contract includes provisioning multiple products or services, we apply judgment to determine whether promised deliverables are capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met, sales of different products or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. For arrangements with multiple distinct performance obligations, we allocate consideration among the performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling price is the price at which we would sell a promised good or service separately to our client and customers.\nOur service fee revenue primarily relates to our order to cash, fulfillment, customer care, consulting, design, digital marketing and technology services.\nWe typically charge our service fee revenue on either a cost-plus basis, a percent of shipped revenue basis, a time and materials, project or retainer basis for our professional services, or a per transaction basis, such as a per item basis for fulfillment services or a per labor hour basis for web-enabled customer contact center services. Additional fees are billed for other services. For technology and digital agency services, we typically charge on a fixed cost basis based on an estimated maximum number of professional service labor hours or bill for each professional labor hour at a per hour price.\nWithin our PFS Operations unit, our performance obligations typically consist of standing ready to provide a service over a contract term. As such, our performance obligations within service fee revenue across the company are generally transferred to clients over time. A time-elapsed output measure is used to determine progress, with individual time increments representing a single series performance obligation. Variable consideration charged within these contracts is allocated to the individual reporting period in which the service was provided. Within our LiveArea Professional Services unit, our contracts are structured so that the amount the Company has a right to invoice corresponds directly with the value of our performance to date, we will elect the \u2018as-invoiced' practical expedient and recognize revenue as we have a right to invoice. If our contract is not structured such that it meets the criteria for this practical expedient, then we use an input measure of progress based on labor hours incurred to date to measure our progress to completion. The Company has determined that the above methods provide a faithful depiction of the transfer of services to the customer.\nWe perform set-up and integration services to support our fulfillment activities. When we determine these set-up and integration services do not meet the criteria for recognition as a separate performance obligation, any start up fees received represent a non-refundable up-front fee and are allocated to the other performance obligations within that contract. The Company recognizes revenue for non-refundable upfront implementation fees on a straight-line basis over the period between the initiation of the services through the end of the contract term. Related costs are capitalized as costs to fulfill the contract and are recognized over the expected performance period.\nFor contracts recognized over time, we recognize the estimated loss to the extent the project has been completed based on actual hours incurred compared to the total estimated hours. A loss is recognized when the current estimate of the consideration we expect to receive, modified to include any variable consideration, is less than the current estimate of total costs for the contract.\nIn instances where revenue is derived from sales of third-party vendor services, we record revenue on a gross basis when we are a principal to the transaction and net of costs when we are acting as an agent between the customer or client and the vendor. Whether we are the principal or agent in the transaction is determined by whether we control the service being provided.\nDepending on the terms of the customer arrangement, product revenue is recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer. This is either upon shipment of the product or when the customer receives the product. Product revenue is reported net of estimated variable consideration related to returns and allowances, which are estimated based upon historical return information. Management also considers any other current information and trends in making estimates. If actual sales returns, allowances and discounts are greater than estimated by management, additional expense may be incurred.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe determination of the collectability of amounts due from our clients and customers requires us to use estimates and make judgments regarding future events and trends, including monitoring our clients' and customers' payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectability is reasonably assured, as well as consideration of the overall business climate in which our clients and customers operate. Inherently, these uncertainties require us to make frequent judgments and estimates regarding our clients and customers' ability to pay amounts due us to determine the appropriate amount of valuation allowances required for doubtful accounts. Provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded when it becomes evident the client or customer will not make the required payments at either contractual due dates or in the future. These provisions may be based on discussions with the client or customer or the age of the amount due.\nIn our Retail model, we also maintain an allowance for uncollectible vendor receivables, which arise from inventory returns to vendors, vendor rebates, price protections and other promotions. We determine the sufficiency of the vendor receivable allowance based upon various factors, including payment history and vendor communication. Amounts received from vendors may vary from amounts recorded because of potential non-compliance with certain elements of vendor programs. If our estimated allowances for uncollectible accounts or vendor receivables subsequently prove insufficient, an additional allowance may be required.\nWe believe our allowances for doubtful accounts are adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions; however, uncertainties regarding changes in the financial condition of our clients and customers, either adverse or positive, could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for doubtful accounts that may be required.\nInventory Reserves\nInventories (merchandise, held for resale, all of which are finished goods) are stated at the lower of weighted average cost or net realizable value. Under the Retail model, we assume responsibility for slow-moving inventory under certain distributor agreements, subject to certain termination rights, but have the right to return product rendered obsolete by engineering changes, as defined. We review inventories for impairment on a periodic basis, but at a minimum, annually. Recoverability of the inventory on hand is measured by comparisons of the carrying value to the fair value of the inventory. This requires us to record provisions and maintain reserves for excess or obsolete inventory. If write-downs of inventories are necessary, the cost basis of that inventory is adjusted. To determine these reserve amounts, we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare them to estimates of future product demand and market conditions. These estimates and forecasts inherently include uncertainties and require us to make judgments regarding potential outcomes. We believe our reserves are adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions; however, significant or unanticipated changes to our estimates and forecasts, either adverse or positive, could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for excess or obsolete inventory that may be required.\nStock Compensation\nWe utilize our Employee Stock and Incentive Plan (the Employee Plan\u201d) to help attract, retain and incentivize qualified executives, key employees and non-employee directors to increase our shareholder value and help build and sustain growth. The Employee Plan provides for the granting of incentive awards in a variety of forms, such as the award of an option, stock appreciation right, restricted stock award, restricted stock unit, deferred stock unit, among other stock-based awards.\nCompensation cost is measured based on the grant date fair value of the award. Depending on the conditions associated with the vesting of the award, compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line or graded basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period of each award.\nWe estimate the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. For certain of the awards that have a market condition, we estimate the compensation cost using a Monte-Carlo simulation. The estimated fair value for awards involves assumptions for expected dividend yield, stock price volatility, risk-free interest rates and the expected life of the award.\nIf, in the future, we determine that another method of estimating an award's fair value is more reasonable, or, if another method for calculating these input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance, and, therefore, should be used to estimate expected volatility or expected term, the fair value calculated for our stock-based compensation could change significantly.\nIncome Taxes\nThe liability method is used for determining our income taxes, under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates. Under this method, the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. Valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets to their net realizable value when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances, we have considered and made judgments and estimates regarding estimated future taxable income. These estimates and judgments include some degree of uncertainty and changes in these estimates and assumptions could require us to adjust the valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets depends on the generation of sufficient taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions. Although we believe our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ, which could be material.\nBecause we operate in multiple countries, we are subject to the jurisdiction of multiple domestic and foreign tax authorities. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the amount of income taxes that we provide during any given year.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting, which requires the assets and liabilities to be recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date in the consolidated financial statements. The determination of estimated fair value may require us to make significant estimates and assumptions, including estimates of future financial performance of the acquired entity. The purchase price is the fair value of the total consideration conveyed to the seller and the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired identifiable net assets, where applicable, is recorded as goodwill. The results of operations of an acquired business are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Costs associated with the acquisition of a business are expensed in the period incurred.\nLong-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nLong-lived assets include property, intangible assets, goodwill and certain other assets. We make judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets, including amounts to be capitalized, depreciation and amortization methods and useful lives. Additionally, we review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We review goodwill for impairment at least annually, during the fourth quarter. We record impairment losses in the period in which we determine the carrying amount is not recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. This may require us to make judgments regarding long-term forecasts of our future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review.\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td>", "summary": "- I'm sorry,

the following discussion and analysis provides information that is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. This Management's Discussion and Analysis will help you understand:\n \u2022 The impact of forward-looking statements; \n \u2022 Key transactions and events during 2018 and 2017; \n \u2022 Our financial structure, including our historical financial presentation; \n \u2022 Our results of operations for the previous two years, as well as certain projections for the future; \n \u2022 Certain aspects of our relationships with our subsidiaries; \n \u2022 Our liquidity and capital resources; \n \u2022 The impact of recently issued accounting standards on our financial statements; and \n \u2022 Our critical accounting policies and estimates. \nForward-Looking Information\nWe have made forward-looking statements in this Report on Form 10-K. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and there can be no guarantee that these statements will prove to be correct. Forward-looking statements include assumptions as to how we may perform in the future. When we use words like seek,\u201d strive,\u201d believe,\u201d expect,\u201d anticipate,\u201d predict,\u201d potential,\u201d continue,\u201d will,\u201d may,\u201d could,\u201d intend,\u201d plan,\u201d target,\u201d project\u201d and estimate\u201d or similar expressions, we are making forward-looking statements. You should understand that the following important factors, in addition to the Risk Factors set forth above or elsewhere in this Report on Form 10-K, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements. These factors include:\n \u2022 our ability to retain and expand relationships with existing clients and attract and implement new clients; \n \u2022 our reliance on the fees generated by the transaction volume, product sales and technology and agency projects and support of our clients; \n \u2022 our reliance on our clients' projections, transaction volumes, product sales, and financial liquidity; \n \u2022 our dependency upon our agreements with International Business Machines Corporation ( IBM\u201d) and Ricoh; \n \u2022 our dependency upon our agreements with our major clients; \n \u2022 our client mix, their business volumes and the seasonality of their business; \n \u2022 our ability to finalize pending client and customer contracts; \n \u2022 the impact of strategic alliances and acquisitions; \n \u2022 trends in e-commerce, outsourcing, government regulation, both foreign and domestic, and the market for our services; \n \u2022 whether we can continue and manage growth; \n \u2022 increased competition; \n \u2022 our ability to generate more revenue and achieve sustainable profitability; \n \u2022 effects of changes in our operating costs and profit margins; \n \u2022 the customer and supplier concentration of our business; \n \u2022 our reliance on third-party providers and other subcontracted services; \n \u2022 the unknown effects of possible system failures and rapid changes in technology; \n \u2022 foreign currency risks and other risks of operating in foreign countries; \n \u2022 potential litigation; \n \u2022 our dependency upon key personnel; \n \u2022 our ability to attract and retain seasonal and temporary workers; \n \u2022 data privacy regulations; \n \u2022 the impact of new accounting standards and changes in existing accounting rules or the interpretations of those rules; \n \u2022 our ability to raise additional capital or obtain additional financing; \n \u2022 our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries, to borrow under current financing arrangements and maintain compliance with debt covenants; \n \u2022 our relationship with, and our guarantees of, certain of the liabilities and indebtedness of our subsidiaries; and \n \u2022 taxation on the sale of our products and provision of our services. \nWe have based these statements on our current expectations about future events. Although we believe the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee these expectations will actually be achieved. In addition, some forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expected or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement for any reason, even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future. There may be additional risks we do not currently view as material or that are not presently known. In evaluating these statements, you should consider various factors, including the risks set forth in the section entitled Risk Factors.\u201d\nKey Transactions and Events\nWe were impacted by the following key transactions and events in 2018 that may affect comparability of our results to 2017 and other periods:\nYear ended December 31, 2018:\n \u2022 Effective January 1, 2018, we changed our organizational structure in an effort to create more effective and efficient operations and to improve client and service focus. As a result, beginning January 1, 2018, we report our financial performance based on our new reportable segments PFS Operations and LiveArea Professional Services. All prior period segment information has been restated to conform with the 2018 presentation. The changes in the reportable segments have no effect on the consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) or cash flows for the periods presented. \n \u2022 We adopted Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606\u201d) on January 1, 2018. We used the modified retrospective method for the transition. Under the modified retrospective method, the cumulative effect of applying the new standard was recorded at January 1, 2018 for open contracts. Therefore, results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 may not be comparable. \nOverview\nWe are a global commerce solutions company. We manage the entire customer shopping experience for major branded manufacturers and retailers through two business segments, LiveArea Professional Services and PFS Operations. The LiveArea Professional Services segment provides services to support and improve the digital shopping experience of shopping online, such as strategic commerce consulting, strategy, design and digital marketing services and technology services. The PFS Operations segment provides services to support and improve the physical experience, such as order management, order fulfillment, customer care and payment services. We offer our services on an a la carte basis or as a complete end-to-end solution.\nService Fee Model. We refer to our standard seller services financial model as the Service Fee model. In this model, our clients own the inventory and are the merchants of record and engage us to provide various infrastructure, technology and digital agency services in support of their business operations. We offer our services as an integrated solution, which enables our clients to outsource their complete eCommerce needs to a single source and to focus on their core competencies, though clients are also able to select individual or groupings of our various service offerings on an \u00e0 la carte basis. We currently provide services to clients that operate in a range of vertical markets, including technology manufacturing, computer products, cosmetics, fragile goods, coins and collectibles, apparel, telecommunications, consumer electronics and consumer packaged goods, among others.\nIn the Service Fee model, we typically charge for our services on time and material basis, a cost-plus basis, a percent of shipped revenue basis, a time and materials, project or retainer basis for our professional services or a per transaction basis, such as a per labor hour basis for web-enabled customer contact center services and a per-item basis for fulfillment services. Additional fees are billed for other services. We price our services based on a variety of factors, including the depth and complexity of the services provided, the amount of capital expenditures or systems customization required, the length of contract and other factors.\nMany of our service fee contracts involve third-party vendors who provide additional services, such as package delivery. The costs we are charged by these third-party vendors for these services are often passed on to our clients. Our billings for reimbursements of these costs and other \u2018out-of-pocket' expenses include travel, shipping and handling costs and telecommunication charges and are included in pass-through revenue.\nAgent (Flash) Model. In our PFS Operations business unit, as an additional service, we offer the Agent, or Flash, financial model, in which our clients maintain ownership of the product inventory stored at our locations as in the Service Fee model. When a customer orders the product from our clients, a flash\u201d sale transaction passes product ownership to us for each order and we in turn immediately re-sell the product to the customer. The flash\u201d ownership exchange establishes us as the merchant of record, which enables us to use our existing merchant infrastructure to process sales to end customers, removing the need for the clients to establish these business processes internally, but permitting them to control the sales process to end customers. In this model, based on the terms of our current client arrangements, we record product revenue net of cost of product revenue as a component of service fee revenue in our consolidated statement of operations.\nRetail Model. Our PFS Operations business unit also provides a Retail model which allows us to purchase inventory from the client. We place the initial and replenishment purchase orders with the client and take ownership of the product either upon shipment to or delivery to our facility. In this model, depending on the terms of our client arrangements, we may own the inventory and the accounts receivable arising from our product sales. Under the Retail model, depending upon the product category and sales characteristics, we may require the client to provide product price protection as well as product purchase payment terms, right of return, and obsolescence protection appropriate to the product sales profile. Depending on the terms of our client arrangements in the Retail model, we record in our consolidated statement of operations either: 1) product revenue as a component of product revenue, or 2) product revenue net of cost of product revenue as a component of service fee revenue. In general, we seek to structure client relationships in our Retail model under the net revenue approach to more closely align with our service fee revenue financial presentation and mitigate inventory ownership risk, although we have one client still operating under the gross revenue approach. Freight costs billed to customers are reflected as components of product revenue. This business model generally requires significant working capital, for which we have credit available either through credit terms provided by our clients or under senior credit facilities.\nCurrently, we are targeting growth within our Retail model to be through relationships with clients under which we can record service fee revenue in our consolidated statement of operations. These relationships are often driven by the sales and marketing efforts of the manufacturers and third party sales partners. In addition, as a result of certain operational restructuring of its business, our primary client relationship operating in the Retail model, Ricoh, has implemented, and will continue to implement, certain changes in the sale and distribution of Ricoh products. The changes have resulted, and are expected to continue to result, in reduced product revenues and profitability under our Retail model.\nGrowth is a key element to achieving our future goals, including achieving and maintaining sustainable profitability. Growth in our company is driven by two main elements: new client relationships and organic growth from existing clients. Within our LiveArea Professional Services segment, we focus our sales efforts on engaging with brands, retailers and manufacturers to perform discrete projects such as website design, platform selection and platform implementation and system integration projects. We also focus our LiveArea sales efforts on engaging with brands, retailers and manufacturers to provide ongoing services such as digital marketing retainers and technology managed services engagements. Within our PFS Operations segment, we focus our sales efforts on larger contracts with brand-name companies within four primary target markets, health and beauty, home goods and collectibles, fashion, and consumer packaged goods. Consumer packaged goods require a longer duration to close but also have the potential to be higher quality and longer duration engagements. Within both segments, we focus our sales efforts on both new clients and also on existing clients where we believe opportunity exists to expand a client relationship to include additional services within the segment, across segments and/or across multiple geographies. We continue to monitor and control our costs to focus on profitability. While we are targeting our new service fee contracts to yield incremental gross profit, we also expect to incur incremental investments in technology development, operational and support management and sales and marketing expenses to help generate growth.\nOur expenses comprise primarily four categories: 1) cost of service fee revenue, 2) cost of product revenue, 3) cost of pass-through revenue and 4) selling, general and administrative expenses.\nCost of service fee revenue - consists primarily of compensation and related expenses for our web-enabled customer contact center services, international fulfillment and distribution services and professional, digital agency and technology services, and other fixed and variable expenses directly related to providing services under the terms of fee based contracts, including certain occupancy and information technology costs and depreciation and amortization expenses.\nCost of product revenue - consists of the purchase price of product sold and freight costs, which are reduced by certain reimbursable expenses. These reimbursable expenses include pass-through customer marketing programs, direct costs incurred in passing on any price decreases offered by vendors to cover price protection and certain special bids, the cost of products provided to replace defective product returned by customers and certain other expenses as defined under the distributor agreements.\nCost of pass-through revenue - the related reimbursable costs for pass-through expenditures are reflected as cost of pass-through revenue.\nSelling, General and Administrative expenses - consist of expenses such as compensation and related expenses for sales and marketing staff, distribution costs (excluding freight) applicable to the Agent and the Retail model, executive, management and administrative personnel and other overhead costs, including certain occupancy and information technology costs, and depreciation and amortization expenses and acquisition related, restructuring and other costs.\nMonitoring and controlling our available cash balances and our expenses continues to be a primary focus. Our cash and liquidity positions are important components of our financing of both current operations and our targeted growth.\nOperating Results\nThe following table discloses certain financial information for the periods presented, expressed in terms of dollars, dollar change, percentage change and as a percentage of total revenues (in thousands, except percentages):\n\n (1) Represents the measure as a percent of Service fee revenue. \n (2) Represents the measure as a percent of Product revenue, net. \n (3) Represents the measure as a percent of Pass-through revenue. \nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nSegment Operating Data\nPFS Operations (in thousands, except percentages)\n\nPFS Operations total revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 increased by $4.9 million compared with the corresponding period in 2017. Service fee revenue increased by $2.4 million due to new and expanded client relationships, partially offset by the impact of client terminations, including the termination of certain lower-margin engagements. Product revenue, net, decreased by $6.3 million due to the revenue stream being primarily dependent on one client, which restructured its operations and discontinued certain product lines which has resulted, and is expected to continue to result, in reduced product revenue activity. Pass-through revenue increased primarily as a result of freight related activity.\nPFS Operations gross margin improved to 18.4% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 15.7% in the same period of the prior year primarily due to improved operational efficiency through enhanced warehouse technology capabilities, focus on higher margin service offerings, including project work, and the termination of certain lower margin client engagements, which did not meet our profitability objectives and were discontinued.\nDirect operating expenses increased by $4.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to the corresponding period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher personnel and facility related costs.\nLiveArea Professional Services (in thousands, except percentages)\n\nLiveArea Professional Services revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $5.6 million compared with the corresponding period in 2017. The decreases in revenues are primarily due to reduced technology services project activity for certain clients, as well as client terminations.\nLiveArea Professional Services gross margin increased slightly to 48.3% from 48.2% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared with the corresponding period in 2017.\nDirect operating expenses decreased by $4.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to the corresponding period in 2017. The decreases were primarily due to lower personnel costs attributable to our cost reduction efforts in response to lower revenues as well as reduced amortization of intangible assets of $1.8 million. Excluding the decrease in amortization of intangible assets, direct contribution decreased by $0.2 million.\nCorporate (in thousands, except percentages)\n\nUnallocated corporate expenses decreased by $1.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to the corresponding period in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a $2.1 million decrease in earnout expense related to our final performance-based contingent payment applicable to our 2015 acquisition of CrossView, Inc. as well as reduced severance costs of $0.8 million, partially offset by an increase in stock-based compensation expenses of $0.7 million. Excluding these expenses, unallocated corporate expenses increased by $0.3 million.\nIncome Taxes\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a tax provision comprised primarily of $1.7 million related to the majority of our international operations, $0.6 million related to state income taxes, and $0.5 million associated with the tax amortization of goodwill relation to our CrossView acquisition. A valuation allowance has been provided for the majority of our domestic net deferred tax assets, which are primarily related to our net operating loss carryforwards, and for certain foreign deferred tax assets.\nOn December 22, 2017, the United States government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, commonly referred to as the Tax Reform Act. The Tax Reform Act included significant changes to the U.S. income tax system, including, but not limited to: a federal corporate rate reduction from 35% to 21%; limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation; repeal of the Alternative Minimum Tax ( AMT\u201d); full expensing provisions related to business assets; creation of new minimum taxes, such as the base erosion anti-abuse tax ( BEAT\u201d) and Global Intangible Low Taxed Income ( GILTI\u201d) tax; and the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax system, which resulted in a one-time U.S. tax liability on those earnings which have not previously been repatriated to the U.S. (the Transition Tax\u201d). The impacts of this legislation are outlined below:\n \u2022 Beginning January 1, 2018, the U.S. corporate income tax rate is 21%. The Company is required to recognize the impacts of this rate change on its deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period enacted. At December 31, 2017, we remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%. The amount related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax balance was $12.1 million that was mostly offset by a change in the valuation allowance, except for a $0.6 million benefit that was recorded to our statement of operations related to tax amortization of goodwill for the period ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 The Transition Tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings is a tax on previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits (\"E&P\") of the Company's foreign subsidiaries. To determine the amount of the Transition Tax, the Company must determine, among other factors, the amount of post-1986 E&P of its foreign subsidiaries, as well as the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid on such earnings. Based on the Company's analysis of the transition tax, there were no provisional amounts recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company concluded the Transition tax analysis in the fourth quarter of 2018 and concluded no measurement period adjustments were required. \n \u2022 The Tax Reform Act creates a new requirement that Global Intangible Low Tax Income ( GILTI\u201d) earned by foreign subsidiaries must be included currently in the gross income of the U.S. shareholder. Due to the complexity of the new GILTI tax rules, the Company is continuing to evaluate this provision of the Tax Reform Act. Under U.S. GAAP, the Company is permitted to make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on future inclusions in U.S. taxable income related to GILTI as a current period expense when incurred or to factor such amounts into the Company's measurement of its deferred taxes. The Company has a GILTI inclusion in taxable income of $0.6 million which has been considered in the tax provision for the period ended December 31, 2018. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe currently believe our cash position, financing available under our credit facilities and funds generated from operations will satisfy our presently known operating cash needs, our working capital and capital expenditure requirements, our current debt and lease obligations, and additional loans to our subsidiaries, if necessary, for at least the next twelve months.\nTo obtain additional financing in the future, in addition to our current cash position, we plan to evaluate various financing alternatives including the sale of equity, utilizing capital or operating leases, borrowing under our credit facilities, expanding our current credit facilities or entering into new debt agreements. No assurances can be given we will be successful in obtaining any additional financing or the terms thereof.\nOur cash position decreased in 2018 primarily due to payments made applicable to capital expenditures, acquisition-related contingencies and debt obligations, all of which combined exceeded our cash generated from operations.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nDuring 2018, cash provided from operations was $11.6 million, compared to $11.1 million in 2017. Cash flow from operating activities increased primarily due to improvements in net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities included capital expenditures of $4.9 million and $4.6 million in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, exclusive of property and equipment acquired under debt and capital lease financing, which consisted primarily of capitalized software costs and equipment purchases.\nCapital expenditures have historically consisted of additions to upgrade our management information systems, development of customized technology solutions to support and integrate with our service fee clients and general expansion and upgrades to our facilities, both domestic and foreign. We expect to incur capital expenditures to support new contracts and anticipated future growth opportunities. Based on our current client business activity and our targeted growth plans, we anticipate our total investment in upgrades and additions to facilities and information technology solutions and services for the upcoming twelve months, including costs to implement new clients, will be approximately $7.0 million to $10.0 million, although additional capital expenditures may be necessary to support the infrastructure requirements of new clients. To maintain our current operating cash position, a portion of these expenditures may be financed through client reimbursements, debt, operating or capital leases or additional equity. We may elect to\nmodify or defer a portion of such anticipated investments in the event that we do not obtain the financing results necessary to support such investments.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nDuring 2018, cash used in financing activities was $9.9 million, compared to $14.7 million in 2017. In both years, the cash used in financing activity was primarily related to the paydown of debt and capital lease obligations as well as the payout of performance-based contingent payments related to our prior year acquisitions.\nWorking Capital\nDuring 2018, our working capital increased to $22.9 million from $13.7 million at December 31, 2017, primarily related to income generated from operations before working capital changes, the refinancing of our U.S. Credit Agreement, which decreased the current portion of our long-term debt, and the reduction of our performance based contingent payment partially offset by capital expenditures and the reductions of our capital lease obligations.\nInventory Financing\nTo finance its distribution of Ricoh products in the U.S., Supplies Distributors has a short-term credit facility with IBM Credit LLC ( IBM Credit\u201d) that provides financing for eligible inventory and certain receivables for up to $11.0 million. We have provided a collateralized guarantee to secure the repayment of this credit facility. The IBM Credit facility does not have a stated maturity and both parties have the ability to exit the facility following a 90-day notice.\nThis credit facility contains various restrictions upon the ability of Supplies Distributors and its subsidiaries to, among other things, merge, consolidate, sell assets, incur indebtedness, make loans, investments and payments to related parties (including entities directly or indirectly owned by PFSweb, Inc.), provide guarantees, make investments and loans, pledge assets, make changes to capital stock ownership structure and pay dividends, as well as financial covenants, such as annualized revenue to working capital, net profit after tax to revenue and total liabilities to tangible net worth, as defined, and are secured by all of the assets of Supplies Distributors, as well as a collateralized guaranty of PFSweb. Additionally, we are required to maintain a subordinated loan to Supplies Distributors of no less than $1.0 million, not maintain restricted cash of more than $5.0 million, are restricted with regard to transactions with related parties, indebtedness and changes to capital stock ownership. Furthermore, we are obligated to repay any over-advance made to Supplies Distributors or its subsidiaries under these facilities if they are unable to do so. We have also provided a guarantee of substantially all of the obligations of Supplies Distributors and its subsidiaries to IBM and Ricoh.\nDebt and Capital Lease Obligations\nU.S. Credit Agreement. In August 2015, we entered into a credit agreement ( Credit Agreement\u201d) with Regions Bank, as agent for itself and one or more future lenders (the Lenders\u201d). Under the Credit Agreement, and subject to the terms set forth therein, the Lenders provided us with a revolving loan facility for up to $32.5 million and a term loan facility for up to $30 million. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement accrued interest at a variable rate based on prime rate or Libor, plus an applicable margin.\nOn November 1, 2018, we entered into Amendment No.1 to our credit agreement with Regions Bank (the Amended Facility\u201d). The Amended Facility provides for an increase in availability of our revolving loans to $60.0 million, with the ability for a further increase of $20.0 million to $80.0 million, and the elimination of the term loan. Amounts outstanding under the term loan were reconstituted as revolving loans. The Amended Facility also extends the maturity date to November 1, 2023.\nIn accordance with ASC 470, Debt ( ASC 470\u201d), we recorded a $0.1 million loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2018 related to the Amended Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the weighted average interest rate on the revolving loan facility was 4.57% and 4.65%, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, the weighted average interest rate on the term loan facility was 4.05%. In connection with the Amended Facility, the Company paid $0.3 million of fees, which are being amortized through the life of the Amended Facility and are reflected as a net reduction in debt. The Amended Facility is secured by a lien on substantially all of the operating assets of the US entities and a pledge of 65% of the shares of certain of our foreign subsidiaries. The Amended Facility contains cross default provisions, various restrictions upon the Company's ability to, among other things, merge, consolidate, sell assets, incur indebtedness, make loans and payments to subsidiaries, affiliates and related parties, make capital expenditures, make investments and loans, pledge assets, make changes to capital stock ownership structure, as well as financial covenants, as defined, of a minimum consolidated fixed charge ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio.\nMaster Lease Agreements. The Company has various agreements that provide for leasing or financing transactions of equipment and other assets and will continue to enter into such arrangements as needed to finance the purchasing or leasing of certain equipment or other assets. Borrowings under these agreements, which generally have terms of three to five years, are generally secured by the related equipment, and in certain cases, by a Company parent guarantee.\nOther than our capital and operating lease commitments, we do not have any other material financial commitments, although future client contracts may require capital expenditures and lease commitments to support the services provided to such clients.\nDebt Covenants\nCertain of our credit facilities contain various financial and non-financial covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, create or permit liens on assets, engage in mergers or consolidations, and place restrictions on the transfer of assets or the payment of dividends between us and our subsidiaries.\nTo the extent we fail to comply with our debt covenants, including the financial covenant requirements and we are not able to obtain a waiver, the lenders would be entitled to accelerate the repayment of any outstanding credit facility obligations, and exercise all other rights and remedies, including sale of collateral. An acceleration of the repayment of our credit facility obligations may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We can provide no assurance we will have the financial ability to repay all such obligations. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all debt covenants. Further, non-renewal of any of our credit facilities may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThere are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements for our discussion about new accounting pronouncements adopted and those pending.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different, application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. If there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions, it could result in a material adverse impact to our business, operating results and financial condition. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. All of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe have defined a critical accounting estimate as one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates about matters that are uncertain. During the past two years, we have not made any material changes in accounting methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates discussed below. The following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates. In addition, there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive revenue primarily from services provided under contractual arrangements with our clients or from the sale of products under our distributor agreements. We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 606, when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our clients and customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services.\nWe will often enter into contracts with clients and customers that contain multiple promises to transfer control of multiple products and/or services. To the extent a contract includes provisioning multiple products or services, we apply judgment to determine whether promised deliverables are capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met, sales of different products or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. For arrangements with multiple distinct performance obligations, we allocate consideration among the performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling price is the price at which we would sell a promised good or service separately to our client and customers.\nOur service fee revenue primarily relates to our order to cash, fulfillment, customer care, consulting, design, digital marketing and technology services.\nWe typically charge our service fee revenue on either a cost-plus basis, a percent of shipped revenue basis, a time and materials, project or retainer basis for our professional services, or a per transaction basis, such as a per item basis for fulfillment services or a per labor hour basis for web-enabled customer contact center services. Additional fees are billed for other services. For technology and digital agency services, we typically charge on a fixed cost basis based on an estimated maximum number of professional service labor hours or bill for each professional labor hour at a per hour price.\nWithin our PFS Operations unit, our performance obligations typically consist of standing ready to provide a service over a contract term. As such, our performance obligations within service fee revenue across the company are generally transferred to clients over time. A time-elapsed output measure is used to determine progress, with individual time increments representing a single series performance obligation. Variable consideration charged within these contracts is allocated to the individual reporting period in which the service was provided. Within our LiveArea Professional Services unit, our contracts are structured so that the amount the Company has a right to invoice corresponds directly with the value of our performance to date, we will elect the \u2018as-invoiced' practical expedient and recognize revenue as we have a right to invoice. If our contract is not structured such that it meets the criteria for this practical expedient, then we use an input measure of progress based on labor hours incurred to date to measure our progress to completion. The Company has determined that the above methods provide a faithful depiction of the transfer of services to the customer.\nWe perform set-up and integration services to support our fulfillment activities. When we determine these set-up and integration services do not meet the criteria for recognition as a separate performance obligation, any start up fees received represent a non-refundable up-front fee and are allocated to the other performance obligations within that contract. The Company recognizes revenue for non-refundable upfront implementation fees on a straight-line basis over the period between the initiation of the services through the end of the contract term. Related costs are capitalized as costs to fulfill the contract and are recognized over the expected performance period.\nFor contracts recognized over time, we recognize the estimated loss to the extent the project has been completed based on actual hours incurred compared to the total estimated hours. A loss is recognized when the current estimate of the consideration we expect to receive, modified to include any variable consideration, is less than the current estimate of total costs for the contract.\nIn instances where revenue is derived from sales of third-party vendor services, we record revenue on a gross basis when we are a principal to the transaction and net of costs when we are acting as an agent between the customer or client and the vendor. Whether we are the principal or agent in the transaction is determined by whether we control the service being provided.\nDepending on the terms of the customer arrangement, product revenue is recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer. This is either upon shipment of the product or when the customer receives the product. Product revenue is reported net of estimated variable consideration related to returns and allowances, which are estimated based upon historical return information. Management also considers any other current information and trends in making estimates. If actual sales returns, allowances and discounts are greater than estimated by management, additional expense may be incurred.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe determination of the collectability of amounts due from our clients and customers requires us to use estimates and make judgments regarding future events and trends, including monitoring our clients' and customers' payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectability is reasonably assured, as well as consideration of the overall business climate in which our clients and customers operate. Inherently, these uncertainties require us to make frequent judgments and estimates regarding our clients and customers' ability to pay amounts due us to determine the appropriate amount of valuation allowances required for doubtful accounts. Provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded when it becomes evident the client or customer will not make the required payments at either contractual due dates or in the future. These provisions may be based on discussions with the client or customer or the age of the amount due.\nIn our Retail model, we also maintain an allowance for uncollectible vendor receivables, which arise from inventory returns to vendors, vendor rebates, price protections and other promotions. We determine the sufficiency of the vendor receivable allowance based upon various factors, including payment history and vendor communication. Amounts received from vendors may vary from amounts recorded because of potential non-compliance with certain elements of vendor programs. If our estimated allowances for uncollectible accounts or vendor receivables subsequently prove insufficient, an additional allowance may be required.\nWe believe our allowances for doubtful accounts are adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions; however, uncertainties regarding changes in the financial condition of our clients and customers, either adverse or positive, could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for doubtful accounts that may be required.\nInventory Reserves\nInventories (merchandise, held for resale, all of which are finished goods) are stated at the lower of weighted average cost or net realizable value. Under the Retail model, we assume responsibility for slow-moving inventory under certain distributor agreements, subject to certain termination rights, but have the right to return product rendered obsolete by engineering changes, as defined. We review inventories for impairment on a periodic basis, but at a minimum, annually. Recoverability of the inventory on hand is measured by comparisons of the carrying value to the fair value of the inventory. This requires us to record provisions and maintain reserves for excess or obsolete inventory. If write-downs of inventories are necessary, the cost basis of that inventory is adjusted. To determine these reserve amounts, we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare them to estimates of future product demand and market conditions. These estimates and forecasts inherently include uncertainties and require us to make judgments regarding potential outcomes. We believe our reserves are adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions; however, significant or unanticipated changes to our estimates and forecasts, either adverse or positive, could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for excess or obsolete inventory that may be required.\nStock Compensation\nWe utilize our Employee Stock and Incentive Plan (the Employee Plan\u201d) to help attract, retain and incentivize qualified executives, key employees and non-employee directors to increase our shareholder value and help build and sustain growth. The Employee Plan provides for the granting of incentive awards in a variety of forms, such as the award of an option, stock appreciation right, restricted stock award, restricted stock unit, deferred stock unit, among other stock-based awards.\nCompensation cost is measured based on the grant date fair value of the award. Depending on the conditions associated with the vesting of the award, compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line or graded basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period of each award.\nWe estimate the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. For certain of the awards that have a market condition, we estimate the compensation cost using a Monte-Carlo simulation. The estimated fair value for awards involves assumptions for expected dividend yield, stock price volatility, risk-free interest rates and the expected life of the award.\nIf, in the future, we determine that another method of estimating an award's fair value is more reasonable, or, if another method for calculating these input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance, and, therefore, should be used to estimate expected volatility or expected term, the fair value calculated for our stock-based compensation could change significantly.\nIncome Taxes\nThe liability method is used for determining our income taxes, under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates. Under this method, the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. Valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets to their net realizable value when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances, we have considered and made judgments and estimates regarding estimated future taxable income. These estimates and judgments include some degree of uncertainty and changes in these estimates and assumptions could require us to adjust the valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets depends on the generation of sufficient taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions. Although we believe our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ, which could be material.\nBecause we operate in multiple countries, we are subject to the jurisdiction of multiple domestic and foreign tax authorities. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the amount of income taxes that we provide during any given year.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting, which requires the assets and liabilities to be recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date in the consolidated financial statements. The determination of estimated fair value may require us to make significant estimates and assumptions, including estimates of future financial performance of the acquired entity. The purchase price is the fair value of the total consideration conveyed to the seller and the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired identifiable net assets, where applicable, is recorded as goodwill. The results of operations of an acquired business are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Costs associated with the acquisition of a business are expensed in the period incurred.\nLong-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nLong-lived assets include property, intangible assets, goodwill and certain other assets. We make judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets, including amounts to be capitalized, depreciation and amortization methods and useful lives. Additionally, we review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We review goodwill for impairment at least annually, during the fourth quarter. We record impairment losses in the period in which we determine the carrying amount is not recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. This may require us to make judgments regarding long-term forecasts of our future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review.\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe the following discussion and analysis provides information that is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. This Management's Discussion and Analysis will help you understand:\n \u2022 The impact of forward-looking statements; \n \u2022 Key transactions and events during 2018 and 2017; \n \u2022 Our financial structure, including our historical financial presentation; \n \u2022 Our results of operations for the previous two years, as well as certain projections for the future; \n \u2022 Certain aspects of our relationships with our subsidiaries; \n \u2022 Our liquidity and capital resources; \n \u2022 The impact of recently issued accounting standards on our financial statements; and \n \u2022 Our critical accounting policies and estimates. \nForward-Looking Information\nWe have made forward-looking statements in this Report on Form 10-K. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and there can be no guarantee that these statements will prove to be correct. Forward-looking statements include assumptions as to how we may perform in the future. When we use words like seek,\u201d strive,\u201d believe,\u201d expect,\u201d anticipate,\u201d predict,\u201d potential,\u201d continue,\u201d will,\u201d may,\u201d could,\u201d intend,\u201d plan,\u201d target,\u201d project\u201d and estimate\u201d or similar expressions, we are making forward-looking statements. You should understand that the following important factors, in addition to the Risk Factors set forth above or elsewhere in this Report on Form 10-K, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements. These factors include:\n \u2022 our ability to retain and expand relationships with existing clients and attract and implement new clients; \n \u2022 our reliance on the fees generated by the transaction volume, product sales and technology and agency projects and support of our clients; \n \u2022 our reliance on our clients' projections, transaction volumes, product sales, and financial liquidity; \n \u2022 our dependency upon our agreements with International Business Machines Corporation ( IBM\u201d) and Ricoh; \n \u2022 our dependency upon our agreements with our major clients; \n \u2022 our client mix, their business volumes and the seasonality of their business; \n \u2022 our ability to finalize pending client and customer contracts; \n \u2022 the impact of strategic alliances and acquisitions; \n \u2022 trends in e-commerce, outsourcing, government regulation, both foreign and domestic, and the market for our services; \n \u2022 whether we can continue and manage growth; \n \u2022 increased competition; \n \u2022 our ability to generate more revenue and achieve sustainable profitability; \n \u2022 effects of changes in our operating costs and profit margins; \n \u2022 the customer and supplier concentration of our business; \n \u2022 our reliance on third-party providers and other subcontracted services; \n \u2022 the unknown effects of possible system failures and rapid changes in technology; \n \u2022 foreign currency risks and other risks of operating in foreign countries; \n \u2022 potential litigation; \n \u2022 our dependency upon key personnel; \n \u2022 our ability to attract and retain seasonal and temporary workers; \n \u2022 data privacy regulations; \n \u2022 the impact of new accounting standards and changes in existing accounting rules or the interpretations of those rules; \n \u2022 our ability to raise additional capital or obtain additional financing; \n \u2022 our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries, to borrow under current financing arrangements and maintain compliance with debt covenants; \n \u2022 our relationship with, and our guarantees of, certain of the liabilities and indebtedness of our subsidiaries; and \n \u2022 taxation on the sale of our products and provision of our services. \nWe have based these statements on our current expectations about future events. Although we believe the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee these expectations will actually be achieved. In addition, some forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expected or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement for any reason, even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future. There may be additional risks we do not currently view as material or that are not presently known. In evaluating these statements, you should consider various factors, including the risks set forth in the section entitled Risk Factors.\u201d\nKey Transactions and Events\nWe were impacted by the following key transactions and events in 2018 that may affect comparability of our results to 2017 and other periods:\nYear ended December 31, 2018:\n \u2022 Effective January 1, 2018, we changed our organizational structure in an effort to create more effective and efficient operations and to improve client and service focus. As a result, beginning January 1, 2018, we report our financial performance based on our new reportable segments PFS Operations and LiveArea Professional Services. All prior period segment information has been restated to conform with the 2018 presentation. The changes in the reportable segments have no effect on the consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) or cash flows for the periods presented. \n \u2022 We adopted Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606\u201d) on January 1, 2018. We used the modified retrospective method for the transition. Under the modified retrospective method, the cumulative effect of applying the new standard was recorded at January 1, 2018 for open contracts. Therefore, results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 may not be comparable. \nOverview\nWe are a global commerce solutions company. We manage the entire customer shopping experience for major branded manufacturers and retailers through two business segments, LiveArea Professional Services and PFS Operations. The LiveArea Professional Services segment provides services to support and improve the digital shopping experience of shopping online, such as strategic commerce consulting, strategy, design and digital marketing services and technology services. The PFS Operations segment provides services to support and improve the physical experience, such as order management, order fulfillment, customer care and payment services. We offer our services on an a la carte basis or as a complete end-to-end solution.\nService Fee Model. We refer to our standard seller services financial model as the Service Fee model. In this model, our clients own the inventory and are the merchants of record and engage us to provide various infrastructure, technology and digital agency services in support of their business operations. We offer our services as an integrated solution, which enables our clients to outsource their complete eCommerce needs to a single source and to focus on their core competencies, though clients are also able to select individual or groupings of our various service offerings on an \u00e0 la carte basis. We currently provide services to clients that operate in a range of vertical markets, including technology manufacturing, computer products, cosmetics, fragile goods, coins and collectibles, apparel, telecommunications, consumer electronics and consumer packaged goods, among others.\nIn the Service Fee model, we typically charge for our services on time and material basis, a cost-plus basis, a percent of shipped revenue basis, a time and materials, project or retainer basis for our professional services or a per transaction basis, such as a per labor hour basis for web-enabled customer contact center services and a per-item basis for fulfillment services. Additional fees are billed for other services. We price our services based on a variety of factors, including the depth and complexity of the services provided, the amount of capital expenditures or systems customization required, the length of contract and other factors.\nMany of our service fee contracts involve third-party vendors who provide additional services, such as package delivery. The costs we are charged by these third-party vendors for these services are often passed on to our clients. Our billings for reimbursements of these costs and other \u2018out-of-pocket' expenses include travel, shipping and handling costs and telecommunication charges and are included in pass-through revenue.\nAgent (Flash) Model. In our PFS Operations business unit, as an additional service, we offer the Agent, or Flash, financial model, in which our clients maintain ownership of the product inventory stored at our locations as in the Service Fee model. When a customer orders the product from our clients, a flash\u201d sale transaction passes product ownership to us for each order and we in turn immediately re-sell the product to the customer. The flash\u201d ownership exchange establishes us as the merchant of record, which enables us to use our existing merchant infrastructure to process sales to end customers, removing the need for the clients to establish these business processes internally, but permitting them to control the sales process to end customers. In this model, based on the terms of our current client arrangements, we record product revenue net of cost of product revenue as a component of service fee revenue in our consolidated statement of operations.\nRetail Model. Our PFS Operations business unit also provides a Retail model which allows us to purchase inventory from the client. We place the initial and replenishment purchase orders with the client and take ownership of the product either upon shipment to or delivery to our facility. In this model, depending on the terms of our client arrangements, we may own the inventory and the accounts receivable arising from our product sales. Under the Retail model, depending upon the product category and sales characteristics, we may require the client to provide product price protection as well as product purchase payment terms, right of return, and obsolescence protection appropriate to the product sales profile. Depending on the terms of our client arrangements in the Retail model, we record in our consolidated statement of operations either: 1) product revenue as a component of product revenue, or 2) product revenue net of cost of product revenue as a component of service fee revenue. In general, we seek to structure client relationships in our Retail model under the net revenue approach to more closely align with our service fee revenue financial presentation and mitigate inventory ownership risk, although we have one client still operating under the gross revenue approach. Freight costs billed to customers are reflected as components of product revenue. This business model generally requires significant working capital, for which we have credit available either through credit terms provided by our clients or under senior credit facilities.\nCurrently, we are targeting growth within our Retail model to be through relationships with clients under which we can record service fee revenue in our consolidated statement of operations. These relationships are often driven by the sales and marketing efforts of the manufacturers and third party sales partners. In addition, as a result of certain operational restructuring of its business, our primary client relationship operating in the Retail model, Ricoh, has implemented, and will continue to implement, certain changes in the sale and distribution of Ricoh products. The changes have resulted, and are expected to continue to result, in reduced product revenues and profitability under our Retail model.\nGrowth is a key element to achieving our future goals, including achieving and maintaining sustainable profitability. Growth in our company is driven by two main elements: new client relationships and organic growth from existing clients. Within our LiveArea Professional Services segment, we focus our sales efforts on engaging with brands, retailers and manufacturers to perform discrete projects such as website design, platform selection and platform implementation and system integration projects. We also focus our LiveArea sales efforts on engaging with brands, retailers and manufacturers to provide ongoing services such as digital marketing retainers and technology managed services engagements. Within our PFS Operations segment, we focus our sales efforts on larger contracts with brand-name companies within four primary target markets, health and beauty, home goods and collectibles, fashion, and consumer packaged goods. Consumer packaged goods require a longer duration to close but also have the potential to be higher quality and longer duration engagements. Within both segments, we focus our sales efforts on both new clients and also on existing clients where we believe opportunity exists to expand a client relationship to include additional services within the segment, across segments and/or across multiple geographies. We continue to monitor and control our costs to focus on profitability. While we are targeting our new service fee contracts to yield incremental gross profit, we also expect to incur incremental investments in technology development, operational and support management and sales and marketing expenses to help generate growth.\nOur expenses comprise primarily four categories: 1) cost of service fee revenue, 2) cost of product revenue, 3) cost of pass-through revenue and 4) selling, general and administrative expenses.\nCost of service fee revenue - consists primarily of compensation and related expenses for our web-enabled customer contact center services, international fulfillment and distribution services and professional, digital agency and technology services, and other fixed and variable expenses directly related to providing services under the terms of fee based contracts, including certain occupancy and information technology costs and depreciation and amortization expenses.\nCost of product revenue - consists of the purchase price of product sold and freight costs, which are reduced by certain reimbursable expenses. These reimbursable expenses include pass-through customer marketing programs, direct costs incurred in passing on any price decreases offered by vendors to cover price protection and certain special bids, the cost of products provided to replace defective product returned by customers and certain other expenses as defined under the distributor agreements.\nCost of pass-through revenue - the related reimbursable costs for pass-through expenditures are reflected as cost of pass-through revenue.\nSelling, General and Administrative expenses - consist of expenses such as compensation and related expenses for sales and marketing staff, distribution costs (excluding freight) applicable to the Agent and the Retail model, executive, management and administrative personnel and other overhead costs, including certain occupancy and information technology costs, and depreciation and amortization expenses and acquisition related, restructuring and other costs.\nMonitoring and controlling our available cash balances and our expenses continues to be a primary focus. Our cash and liquidity positions are important components of our financing of both current operations and our targeted growth.\nOperating Results\nThe following table discloses certain financial

Service fee revenue increased by $2.4 million due to new and expanded client relationships, partially offset by the impact of client terminations, including the termination of certain lower-margin engagements. Product revenue, net, decreased by $6.3 million due to the revenue stream being primarily dependent on one client, which restructured its operations and discontinued certain product lines which has resulted, and is expected to continue to result, in reduced product revenue activity. Pass-through revenue increased primarily as a result of freight related activity.\nPFS Operations gross margin improved to 18.4% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 15.7% in the same period of the prior year primarily due to improved operational efficiency through enhanced warehouse technology capabilities, focus on higher margin service offerings, including project work, and the termination of certain lower margin client engagements, which did not meet our profitability objectives and were discontinued.\nDirect operating expenses increased by $4.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to the corresponding period in 2017.

The decrease was primarily due to a $2.1 million decrease in earnout expense related to our final performance-based contingent payment applicable to our 2015 acquisition of CrossView, Inc. as well as reduced severance costs of $0.8 million, partially offset by an increase in stock-based compensation expenses of $0.7 million. Excluding these expenses, unallocated corporate expenses increased by $0.3 million.\nIncome Taxes\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a tax provision comprised primarily of $1.7 million related to the majority of our international operations, $0.6 million related to state income taxes, and $0.5 million associated with the tax amortization of goodwill relation to our CrossView acquisition. A valuation allowance has been provided for the majority of our domestic net deferred tax assets, which are primarily related to our net operating loss carryforwards, and for certain foreign deferred tax assets.\nOn December 22, 2017, the United States government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, commonly referred to as the Tax Reform Act. The Tax Reform Act included significant changes to the U.S. income tax system, including, but not limited to: a federal corporate rate reduction from 35% to 21%; limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation; repeal of the Alternative Minimum Tax ( AMT\u201d); full expensing provisions related to business assets; creation of new minimum taxes, such as the base erosion anti-abuse tax ( BEAT\u201d) and Global Intangible Low Taxed Income ( GILTI\u201d) tax; and the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax system, which resulted in a one-time U.S. tax liability on those earnings which have not previously been repatriated to the U.S. (the Transition Tax\u201d). The impacts of this legislation are outlined below:\n \u2022 Beginning January 1, 2018, the U.S. corporate income tax rate is 21%. The Company is required to recognize the impacts of this rate change on its deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period enacted. At December 31, 2017, we remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%. The amount related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax balance was $12.1 million that was mostly offset by a change in the valuation allowance, except for a $0.6 million benefit that was recorded to our statement of operations related to tax amortization of goodwill for the period ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 The Transition Tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings is a tax on previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits (\"E&P\") of the Company's foreign subsidiaries. To determine the amount of the Transition Tax, the Company must determine, among other factors, the amount of post-1986 E&P of its foreign subsidiaries, as well as the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid on such earnings. Based on the Company's analysis of the transition tax, there were no provisional amounts recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company concluded the Transition tax analysis in the fourth quarter of 2018 and concluded no measurement period adjustments were required. \n \u2022 The Tax Reform Act creates a new requirement that Global Intangible Low Tax Income ( GILTI\u201d) earned by foreign subsidiaries must be included currently in the gross income of the U.S. shareholder. Due to the complexity of the new GILTI tax rules, the Company is continuing to evaluate this provision of the Tax Reform Act. Under U.S. GAAP, the Company is permitted to make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on future inclusions in U.S. taxable income related to GILTI as a current period expense when incurred or to factor such amounts into the Company's measurement of its deferred taxes. The Company has a GILTI inclusion in taxable income of $0.6 million which has been considered in the tax provision for the period ended December 31, 2018. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe currently believe our cash position, financing available under our credit facilities and funds generated from operations will satisfy our presently known operating cash needs, our working capital and capital expenditure requirements, our current debt and lease obligations, and additional loans to our subsidiaries, if necessary, for at least the next twelve months.\nTo obtain additional financing in the future, in addition to our current cash position, we plan to evaluate various financing alternatives including the sale of equity, utilizing capital or operating leases, borrowing under our credit facilities, expanding our current credit facilities or entering into new debt agreements. No assurances can be given we will be successful in obtaining any additional financing or the terms thereof.\nOur cash position decreased in 2018 primarily due to payments made applicable to capital expenditures, acquisition-related contingencies and debt obligations, all of which combined exceeded our cash generated from operations.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nDuring 2018, cash provided from operations was $11.6 million, compared to $11.1 million in 2017. Cash flow from operating activities increased primarily due to improvements in net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities included capital expenditures of $4.9 million and $4.6 million in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, exclusive of property and equipment acquired under debt and capital lease financing, which consisted primarily of capitalized software costs and equipment purchases.\nCapital expenditures have historically consisted of additions to upgrade our management information systems, development of customized technology solutions to support and integrate with our service fee clients and general expansion and upgrades to our facilities, both domestic and foreign. We expect to incur capital expenditures to support new contracts and anticipated future growth opportunities. Based on our current client business activity and our targeted growth plans, we anticipate our total investment in upgrades and additions to facilities and information technology solutions and services for the upcoming twelve months, including costs to implement new clients, will be approximately $7.0 million to $10.0 million, although additional capital expenditures may be necessary to support the infrastructure requirements of new clients. To maintain our current operating cash position, a portion of these expenditures may be financed through client reimbursements, debt, operating or capital leases or additional equity. We may elect to\nmodify or defer a portion of such anticipated investments in the event that we do not obtain the financing results necessary to support such investments.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nDuring 2018, cash used in financing activities was $9.9 million, compared to $14.7 million in 2017. In both years, the cash used in financing activity was primarily related to the paydown of debt and capital lease obligations as well as the payout of performance-based contingent payments related to our prior year acquisitions.\nWorking Capital\nDuring 2018, our working capital increased to $22.9 million from $13.7 million at December 31, 2017, primarily related to income generated from operations before working capital changes, the refinancing of our U.S. Credit Agreement, which decreased the current portion of our long-term debt, and the reduction of our performance based contingent payment partially offset by capital expenditures and the reductions of our capital lease obligations.\nInventory Financing\nTo finance its distribution of Ricoh products in the U.S., Supplies Distributors has a short-term credit facility with IBM Credit LLC ( IBM Credit\u201d) that provides financing for eligible inventory and certain receivables for up to $11.0 million. We have provided a collateralized guarantee to secure the repayment of this credit facility. The IBM Credit facility does not have a stated maturity and both parties have the ability to exit the facility following a 90-day notice.\nThis credit facility contains various restrictions upon the ability of Supplies Distributors and its subsidiaries to, among other things, merge, consolidate, sell assets, incur indebtedness, make loans, investments and payments to related parties (including entities directly or indirectly owned by PFSweb, Inc.), provide guarantees, make investments and loans, pledge assets, make changes to capital stock ownership structure and pay dividends, as well as financial covenants, such as annualized revenue to working capital, net profit after tax to revenue and total liabilities to tangible net worth, as defined, and are secured by all of the assets of Supplies Distributors, as well as a collateralized guaranty of PFSweb. Additionally, we are required to maintain a subordinated loan to Supplies Distributors of no less than $1.0 million, not maintain restricted cash of more than $5.0 million, are restricted with regard to transactions with related parties, indebtedness and changes to capital stock ownership. Furthermore, we are obligated to repay any over-advance made to Supplies Distributors or its subsidiaries under these facilities if they are unable to do so. We have also provided a guarantee of substantially all of the obligations of Supplies Distributors and its subsidiaries to IBM and Ricoh.\nDebt and Capital Lease Obligations\nU.S. Credit Agreement. In August 2015, we entered into a credit agreement ( Credit Agreement\u201d) with Regions Bank, as agent for itself and one or more future lenders (the Lenders\u201d). Under the Credit Agreement, and subject to the terms set forth therein, the Lenders provided us with a revolving loan facility for up to $32.5 million and a term loan facility for up to $30 million. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement accrued interest at a variable rate based on prime rate or Libor, plus an applicable margin.\nOn November 1, 2018, we entered into Amendment No.1 to our credit agreement with Regions Bank (the Amended Facility\u201d). The Amended Facility provides for an increase in availability of our revolving loans to $60.0 million, with the ability for a further increase of $20.0 million to $80.0 million, and the elimination of the term loan. Amounts outstanding under the term loan were reconstituted as revolving loans. The Amended Facility also extends the maturity date to November 1, 2023.\nIn accordance with ASC 470, Debt ( ASC 470\u201d), we recorded a $0.1 million loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2018 related to the Amended Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the weighted average interest rate on the revolving loan facility was 4.57% and 4.65%, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, the weighted average interest rate on the term loan facility was 4.05%. In connection with the Amended Facility, the Company paid $0.3 million of fees, which are being amortized through the life of the Amended Facility and are reflected as a net reduction in debt. The Amended Facility is secured by a lien on substantially all of the operating assets of the US entities and a pledge of 65% of the shares of certain of our foreign subsidiaries. The Amended Facility contains cross default provisions, various restrictions upon the Company's ability to, among other things, merge, consolidate, sell assets, incur indebtedness, make loans and payments to subsidiaries, affiliates and related parties, make capital expenditures, make investments and loans, pledge assets, make changes to capital stock ownership structure, as well as financial covenants, as defined, of a minimum consolidated fixed charge ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio.\nMaster Lease Agreements. The Company has various agreements that provide for leasing or financing transactions of equipment and other assets and will continue to enter into such arrangements as needed to finance the purchasing or leasing of certain equipment or other assets. Borrowings under these agreements, which generally have terms of three to five years, are generally secured by the related equipment, and in certain cases, by a Company parent guarantee.\nOther than our capital and operating lease commitments, we do not have any other material financial commitments, although future client contracts may require capital expenditures and lease commitments to support the services provided to such clients.\nDebt Covenants\nCertain of our credit facilities contain various financial and non-financial covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, create or permit liens on assets, engage in mergers or consolidations, and place restrictions on the transfer of assets or the payment of dividends between us and our subsidiaries.\nTo the extent we fail to comply with our debt covenants, including the financial covenant requirements and we are not able to obtain a waiver, the lenders would be entitled to accelerate the repayment of any outstanding credit facility obligations, and exercise all other rights and remedies, including sale of collateral. An acceleration of the repayment of our credit facility obligations may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We can provide no assurance we will have the financial ability to repay all such obligations. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all debt covenants. Further, non-renewal of any of our credit facilities may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThere are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements for our discussion about new accounting pronouncements adopted and those pending.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different, application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. If there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions, it could result in a material adverse impact to our business, operating results and financial condition. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. All of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe have defined a critical accounting estimate as one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates about matters that are uncertain. During the past two years, we have not made any material changes in accounting methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates discussed below. The following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates. In addition, there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive revenue primarily from services provided under contractual arrangements with our clients or from the sale of products under our distributor agreements. We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 606, when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our clients and customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services.\nWe will often enter into contracts with clients and customers that contain multiple promises to transfer control of multiple products and/or services. To the extent a contract includes provisioning multiple products or services, we apply judgment to determine whether promised deliverables are capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met, sales of different products or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. For arrangements with multiple distinct performance obligations, we allocate consideration among the performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling price is the price at which we would sell a promised good or service separately to our client and customers.\nOur service fee revenue primarily relates to our order to cash, fulfillment, customer care, consulting, design, digital marketing and technology services.\nWe typically charge our service fee revenue on either a cost-plus basis, a percent of shipped revenue basis, a time and materials, project or retainer basis for our professional services, or a per transaction basis, such as a per item basis for fulfillment services or a per labor hour basis for web-enabled customer contact center services. Additional fees are billed for other services. For technology and digital agency services, we typically charge on a fixed cost basis based on an estimated maximum number of professional service labor hours or bill for each professional labor hour at a per hour price.\nWithin our PFS Operations unit, our performance obligations typically consist of standing ready to provide a service over a contract term. As such, our performance obligations within service fee revenue across the company are generally transferred to clients over time. A time-elapsed output measure is used to determine progress, with individual time increments representing a single series performance obligation. Variable consideration charged within these contracts is allocated to the individual reporting period in which the service was provided. Within our LiveArea Professional Services unit, our contracts are structured so that the amount the Company has a right to invoice corresponds directly with the value of our performance to date, we will elect the \u2018as-invoiced' practical expedient and recognize revenue as we have a right to invoice. If our contract is not structured such that it meets the criteria for this practical expedient, then we use an input measure of progress based on labor hours incurred to date to measure our progress to completion. The Company has determined that the above methods provide a faithful depiction of the transfer of services to the customer.\nWe perform set-up and integration services to support our fulfillment activities. When we determine these set-up and integration services do not meet the criteria for recognition as a separate performance obligation, any start up fees received represent a non-refundable up-front fee and are allocated to the other performance obligations within that contract. The Company recognizes revenue for non-refundable upfront implementation fees on a straight-line basis over the period between the initiation of the services through the end of the contract term. Related costs are capitalized as costs to fulfill the contract and are recognized over the expected performance period.\nFor contracts recognized over time, we recognize the estimated loss to the extent the project has been completed based on actual hours incurred compared to the total estimated hours. A loss is recognized when the current estimate of the consideration we expect to receive, modified to include any variable consideration, is less than the current estimate of total costs for the contract.\nIn instances where revenue is derived from sales of third-party vendor services, we record revenue on a gross basis when we are a principal to the transaction and net of costs when we are acting as an agent between the customer or client and the vendor. Whether we are the principal or agent in the transaction is determined by whether we control the service being provided.\nDepending on the terms of the customer arrangement, product revenue is recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer. This is either upon shipment of the product or when the customer receives the product. Product revenue is reported net of estimated variable consideration related to returns and allowances, which are estimated based upon historical return information. Management also considers any other current information and trends in making estimates. If actual sales returns, allowances and discounts are greater than estimated by management, additional expense may be incurred.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe determination of the collectability of amounts due from our clients and customers requires us to use estimates and make judgments regarding future events and trends, including monitoring our clients' and customers' payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectability is reasonably assured, as well as consideration of the overall business climate in which our clients and customers operate. Inherently, these uncertainties require us to make frequent judgments and estimates regarding our clients and customers' ability to pay amounts due us to determine the appropriate amount of valuation allowances required for doubtful accounts. Provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded when it becomes evident the client or customer will not make the required payments at either contractual due dates or in the future. These provisions may be based on discussions with the client or customer or the age of the amount due.\nIn our Retail model, we also maintain an allowance for uncollectible vendor receivables, which arise from inventory returns to vendors, vendor rebates, price protections and other promotions. We determine the sufficiency of the vendor receivable allowance based upon various factors, including payment history and vendor communication. Amounts received from vendors may vary from amounts recorded because of potential non-compliance with certain elements of vendor programs. If our estimated allowances for uncollectible accounts or vendor receivables subsequently prove insufficient, an additional allowance may be required.\nWe believe our allowances for doubtful accounts are adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions; however, uncertainties regarding changes in the financial condition of our clients and customers, either adverse or positive, could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for doubtful accounts that may be required.\nInventory Reserves\nInventories (merchandise, held for resale, all of which are finished goods) are stated at the lower of weighted average cost or net realizable value. Under the Retail model, we assume responsibility for slow-moving inventory under certain distributor agreements, subject to certain termination rights, but have the right to return product rendered obsolete by engineering changes, as defined. We review inventories for impairment on a periodic basis, but at a minimum, annually. Recoverability of the inventory on hand is measured by comparisons of the carrying value to the fair value of the inventory. This requires us to record provisions and maintain reserves for excess or obsolete inventory. If write-downs of inventories are necessary, the cost basis of that inventory is adjusted. To determine these reserve amounts, we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare them to estimates of future product demand and market conditions. These estimates and forecasts inherently include uncertainties and require us to make judgments regarding potential outcomes. We believe our reserves are adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions; however, significant or unanticipated changes to our estimates and forecasts, either adverse or positive, could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for excess or obsolete inventory that may be required.\nStock Compensation\nWe utilize our Employee Stock and Incentive Plan (the Employee Plan\u201d) to help attract, retain and incentivize qualified executives, key employees and non-employee directors to increase our shareholder value and help build and sustain growth. The Employee Plan provides for the granting of incentive awards in a variety of forms, such as the award of an option, stock appreciation right, restricted stock award, restricted stock unit, deferred stock unit, among other stock-based awards.\nCompensation cost is measured based on the grant date fair value of the award. Depending on the conditions associated with the vesting of the award, compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line or graded basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period of each award.\nWe estimate the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. For certain of the awards that have a market condition, we estimate the compensation cost using a Monte-Carlo simulation. The estimated fair value for awards involves assumptions for expected dividend yield, stock price volatility, risk-free interest rates and the expected life of the award.\nIf, in the future, we determine that another method of estimating an award's fair value is more reasonable, or, if another method for calculating these input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance, and, therefore, should be used to estimate expected volatility or expected term, the fair value calculated for our stock-based compensation could change significantly.\nIncome Taxes\nThe liability method is used for determining our income taxes, under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates. Under this method, the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. Valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets to their net realizable value when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances, we have considered and made judgments and estimates regarding estimated future taxable income. These estimates and judgments include some degree of uncertainty and changes in these estimates and assumptions could require us to adjust the valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets depends on the generation of sufficient taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions. Although we believe our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ, which could be material.\nBecause we operate in multiple countries, we are subject to the jurisdiction of multiple domestic and foreign tax authorities. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the amount of income taxes that we provide during any given year.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting, which requires the assets and liabilities to be recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date in the consolidated financial statements. The determination of estimated fair value may require us to make significant estimates and assumptions, including estimates of future financial performance of the acquired entity. The purchase price is the fair value of the total consideration conveyed to the seller and the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired identifiable net assets, where applicable, is recorded as goodwill. The results of operations of an acquired business are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Costs associated with the acquisition of a business are expensed in the period incurred.\nLong-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nLong-lived assets include property, intangible assets, goodwill and certain other assets. We make judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets, including amounts to be capitalized, depreciation and amortization methods and useful lives. Additionally, we review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We review goodwill for impairment at least annually, during the fourth quarter. We record impairment losses in the period in which we determine the carrying amount is not recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. This may require us to make judgments regarding long-term forecasts of our future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review.\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td>"}
