MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis section includes a discussion of our operations for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2019 and 2018. The following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes thereto in Part II, Item 8 of this report and the Selected Financial Data contained in Part II, Item 6 of this report.\nFor discussion of our results of operations for fiscal year 2017 including comparison to fiscal 2018 refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2018, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 24, 2018.\nBusiness\nFounded in 1906, Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. ( SSI\u201d), an Oregon corporation, is one of North America's largest recyclers of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal, including end-of-life vehicles, and a manufacturer of finished steel products.\nOur internal organizational and reporting structure includes two operating and reportable segments: the Auto and Metals Recycling ( AMR\u201d) business and the Cascade Steel and Scrap ( CSS\u201d) business.\nWe use segment operating income to measure our segment performance. We do not allocate corporate interest income and expense, income taxes, and other income and expense to our reportable segments. Certain expenses related to shared services that support operational activities and transactions are allocated from Corporate to the segments. Unallocated Corporate expense consists primarily of expense for management and certain administrative services that benefit both reportable segments. In addition, we do not allocate certain items to segment operating income because management does not include the information in its measurement of the performance of the operating segments. Such unallocated items include restructuring charges and other exit-related activities, charges (net of recoveries) related to legacy environmental matters, and provisions for certain legal matters. Because of the unallocated income and expense, the operating income of each reportable segment does not reflect the operating income the reportable segment would report as a stand-alone business. The results of discontinued operations are excluded from segment operating income and are presented separately, net of tax, from the results of ongoing operations for all periods presented. See Note 16 - Segment Information in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a discussion of the primary activities of each reportable segment, total assets by reportable segment, operating results from continuing operations by reportable segment, revenues from external customers and concentration of sales to foreign countries.\nOur results of operations depend in large part on the demand and prices for recycled metal in foreign and domestic markets and on the supply of raw materials, including end-of-life vehicles, available to be processed at our facilities. We respond to changes in selling prices for processed metal by seeking to adjust purchase prices for unprocessed scrap metal in order to manage the impact on our operating income. We believe we generally benefit from sustained periods of rising recycled scrap metal selling prices, which allow us to better maintain or increase both operating income and unprocessed scrap metal flow into our facilities. When recycled scrap metal selling prices decline, particularly for a sustained period, our operating margins typically compress.\nOur deep water port facilities on both the East and West Coasts of the U.S. (in Everett, Massachusetts; Providence, Rhode Island; Oakland, California; Tacoma, Washington; and Portland, Oregon) and access to public deep water port facilities (in Kapolei, Hawaii and Salinas, Puerto Rico) allow us to efficiently meet the global demand for recycled ferrous metal by enabling us to ship bulk cargoes to steel manufacturers located in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia, North America, Central America, and South America. Our exports of nonferrous recycled metal are shipped in containers through various public docks to specialty steelmakers, foundries, aluminum sheet and ingot manufacturers, copper refineries and smelters, brass and bronze ingot manufacturers, wire and cable producers, wholesalers, and other recycled metal processors globally. We also transport both ferrous and nonferrous metals by truck, rail and barge in order to transfer scrap metal between our facilities for further processing, to load shipments at our export facilities, and to meet regional domestic demand.\nOur results of operations also depend on the demand and prices for our finished steel products, the manufacture of which uses internally sourced ferrous recycled scrap metal as the primary feedstock, as well as other raw materials. Our steel mill in Oregon sells to industrial customers primarily in North America.\n29 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2019\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur quarterly operating results fluctuate based on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, changes in market conditions for ferrous and nonferrous recycled metal and finished steel products, the supply of scrap metal in our domestic markets, and varying demand for used auto parts from our self-service retail stores. Certain of these factors are influenced, to a degree, by the impact of seasonal changes including severe weather conditions, which can impact the timing of shipments and inhibit construction activity utilizing our products, scrap metal collection at our facilities and production levels in our yards, and retail admissions and parts sales at our auto parts stores. Further, trade actions, including tariffs and any retaliation by affected countries, and licensing and inspection requirements can impact the level of profitability on sales of our products and, in certain cases, impede or restrict our ability to sell to certain export markets or require us to direct our sales to alternative market destinations, which can cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate. For further information regarding the potential impact of changing conditions in global markets including the impact of tariffs, quotas and other trade actions and import restrictions on our business and results of operations, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report.\nStrategic Priorities\nAs we continue to closely monitor economic conditions, we remain focused on the following core strategies and plans to meet our business goals and objectives:\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Long-term expansion of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal supply and processing, sales volumes and operating margins;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Technology investments and process improvements to increase the separation and recovery of recycled materials from our shredding process and to expand product optionality;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Productivity and continuous improvement initiatives to ensure the safety of our employees, increase operating efficiency and effectiveness, advance sustainable business practices, improve natural resource stewardship, and reduce operating expense;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Use of our seven deep water ports and ground-based logistics network to directly access customers domestically and internationally to meet demand for our products wherever it is greatest;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Further optimization of our integrated recycling and steel manufacturing operating platforms to maximize opportunities for synergies, cost efficiencies and volumes; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Increase market share through initiatives to maximize volumes and through selective partnerships, alliances and acquisitions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nKey economic factors and trends affecting the industries in which we operate\nWe sell recycled metals to the global steel industry for the production of finished steel. Our financial results largely depend on supply of raw materials in the U.S. and Western Canada and demand for recycled metal in foreign and domestic markets and for finished steel products in the Western U.S. Demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions. The timing and magnitude of the economic cycles in the industries in which our products are used, including global steel manufacturing and nonresidential and infrastructure construction in the U.S., are difficult to predict. Global economic conditions, changes in supply and demand conditions, the strength of the U.S. dollar, the availability and price of raw material alternatives, and trade actions such as tariffs affect market prices for and sales volumes of recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal in global markets and steel products in the Western U.S. and can have a significant impact on the results of operations for our reportable segments.\nBeginning in the second half of fiscal 2016 through fiscal 2018, the combination of improved U.S. and global economic growth, lower Chinese steel exports, and increased use of EAFs by steel manufacturers in other export markets contributed to improved demand and prices for ferrous recycled scrap metal, positively impacting our operating results. In fiscal 2018, selling prices for ferrous recycled metal rose during the first three quarters followed by a modest decrease in the fourth quarter. The higher price environment for scrap metal during fiscal 2018 together with benefits from increased sales diversification, commercial initiatives to improve supply channels and a strong U.S. economy led to an increase in scrap supply flows into our facilities, including end-of-life vehicles, resulting in higher processed volumes compared to recent prior years. The higher average selling prices supported an expansion of the spread between direct purchase costs and selling prices of ferrous recycled metal compared to the prior year. Our operating margins also benefited from improved volumes of nonferrous material from end-of-life vehicles and the shredding process, partially offset by operating margin compression experienced near the end of fiscal 2018 as a result of a decrease in average net selling prices for certain nonferrous products driven primarily by the global impact of new regulations and measures put into place by China during the year, including import regulations and tariffs on U.S. scrap imports.\n30 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2019\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn fiscal 2018, our CSS business benefited from reduced price pressure from steel imports, the impact of U.S. tariffs on steel imports, and steady demand for finished steel products in the West Coast markets which contributed to higher selling prices for our finished steel products. CSS experienced improved metal margins in fiscal 2018 from selling prices increasing faster than raw material purchase prices which, in combination with operational synergies gained following the integration of our steel manufacturing and Oregon metals recycling operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, led to significantly improved results compared to the prior year.\nIn fiscal 2019, weaker market conditions for recycled metals, primarily due to slower global economic growth and the effects of tariffs and other regulatory measures, resulted in lower average net selling prices for our ferrous and nonferrous recycled metal products and lower ferrous export sales volumes compared to fiscal 2018. Operating results at AMR in fiscal 2019 decreased significantly compared to fiscal 2018 as a result of operating margin compression from the decline in average net selling prices for our recycled metal products which outpaced the reduction in purchase costs for raw materials. Average net selling prices for ferrous recycled metal have trended downwards since the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Domestic ferrous sales volumes in fiscal 2019 increased compared to the prior year, reflecting strong demand in the U.S. market particularly during the first half of fiscal 2019, partially offsetting the adverse impact of the weaker ferrous export market conditions and lower average net selling prices. Nonferrous average net selling prices in fiscal 2019 decreased significantly compared to fiscal 2018 primarily reflecting reduced demand for nonferrous products globally, as well as the continued impact of Chinese import restrictions and tariffs on certain nonferrous products put into place starting in the second half of fiscal 2018.\nIn fiscal 2019, CSS benefited from reduced pressure from steel imports and higher net selling prices for finished steel products particularly during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, resulting in higher finished steel margins in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior year. However, these benefits were more than offset by lower finished steel and recycled metal sales volumes and increased steelmaking consumables costs compared to fiscal 2018, resulting in lower operating results at CSS year-over-year.\nExecutive Overview of Financial Results\nWe generated consolidated revenues of $2.1 billion in fiscal 2019, a decrease of 10% from the $2.4 billion of consolidated revenues generated in fiscal 2018, primarily reflecting weaker market conditions for recycled metals globally resulting in lower average net selling prices for our ferrous and nonferrous products compared to the prior year. In fiscal 2019, the average net selling prices for ferrous and nonferrous recycled metal at AMR were 9% and 18% lower, respectively, compared to the prior year. Steel revenues in fiscal 2019 were flat compared to the prior year reflecting the impact of higher average net selling prices for our finished steel products offset by lower finished steel sales volumes compared to the prior year.\nConsolidated operating income was $84 million in fiscal 2019, compared to $149 million in fiscal 2018. AMR reported operating income in fiscal 2019 of $96 million, compared to $169 million in the prior year. The decrease in AMR operating results in fiscal 2019 was primarily the result of operating margin compression from the decline in average net selling prices for our ferrous and nonferrous products which outpaced the reduction in purchase costs for raw materials, partially offset by the benefits from productivity initiatives and higher nonferrous sales volumes compared to the prior year. The lower average ferrous selling prices in fiscal 2019 primarily reflected the weaker price environment for recycled metals in our domestic markets and the effects of tariffs and other regulatory measures on demand for recycled metals in our export markets. The lower average nonferrous selling prices in fiscal 2019 primarily resulted from reduced demand for nonferrous products globally, as well as the continued effects of Chinese import restrictions and tariffs on certain nonferrous products put into place starting in the second half of fiscal 2018. The spread between direct purchase costs and selling prices of ferrous recycled metal at AMR in fiscal 2019 contracted by approximately 4% compared to the prior year and average net selling prices for AMR's nonferrous joint products recovered from the shredding process, comprising primarily zorba, decreased by 26% in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior year, contributing significantly to the operating margin compression at AMR in fiscal 2019. CSS reported operating income of $32 million in fiscal 2019, compared to $38 million in the prior year, reflecting lower sales of recycled scrap metal and lower finished steel sales volumes partially offset by higher finished steel margins driven by the effects of the higher price environment, and the benefits from productivity initiatives.\nConsolidated selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expense in fiscal 2019 decreased by $17 million, or 8%, compared to the prior year primarily due to decreased employee-related expenses, including from lower incentive compensation accruals, and decreased environmental-related and legal and professional services expenses.\nIn fiscal 2019, we undertook productivity initiatives aimed at delivering $35 million in annual benefits in order to mitigate the weaker price environment in the ferrous and nonferrous markets. We expect these benefits will be achieved through a combination of production cost efficiencies, reductions in SG&A expense and increases in retail sales. Of the total, approximately 75% of the targeted benefits are in AMR with the remainder split between CSS and Corporate. We achieved over 80% of the total targeted benefits in fiscal 2019 with the full amount expected to be achieved in fiscal 2020. For fiscal 2019, we achieved approximately $30 million in benefits as a result of these initiatives.\n31 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc.

Revenues\nRevenues in fiscal 2019 decreased by 12% compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to weaker market conditions for recycled metal globally, resulting in lower average net selling prices for our ferrous and nonferrous products compared to fiscal 2018. Despite the lower price environment, domestic ferrous sales volumes in fiscal 2019 increased by 17% compared to the prior year due to increased U.S. steel mill utilization, partially offsetting the adverse impact of the weaker ferrous export market conditions in the year. Nonferrous revenues in fiscal 2019 decreased by 11% compared to the prior year, as average net selling prices decreased by 18% compared to fiscal 2018, primarily reflecting reduced demand for nonferrous products globally, as well as the continued impact of Chinese import restrictions and tariffs on certain nonferrous products put into place starting in the second half of fiscal 2018.\n34 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2019\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAMR Segment Operating Income\nOperating income for fiscal 2019 was $96 million, compared to $169 million in fiscal 2018. The decrease in AMR operating results in fiscal 2019 was primarily the result of operating margin compression from the decline in average net selling prices for our ferrous and nonferrous products which outpaced the reduction in purchase costs for raw materials. The lower average ferrous and nonferrous selling prices in fiscal 2019 reflect the effects of tariffs and other regulatory measures on demand for recycled metals in our export markets, the weaker price environment for recycled metals in our domestic markets, and reduced demand for nonferrous products globally. The spread between direct purchase costs and selling prices of ferrous recycled metal at AMR in fiscal 2019 contracted by approximately 4% compared to the prior year and average net selling prices for AMR's nonferrous joint products recovered from the shredding process, comprising primarily zorba, decreased by 26% in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior year, contributing significantly to the operating margin compression at AMR in fiscal 2019. The adverse effects of lower average net selling prices for recycled metals were partially offset by benefits from productivity initiatives, higher nonferrous sales volumes compared to the prior year, and positive contributions from a limited-duration contract. This contract, which was substantially complete at the end of fiscal 2019, provided a high margin source of supply and benefited AMR operating income by $20 million for fiscal 2019, compared to $23 million for the prior year. AMR SG&A expense in fiscal 2019 decreased by $2 million, or 2%, compared to the prior year primarily due to lower employee-related expenses, including from reduced incentive compensation

The Tax Act's primary change is a reduction in the federal statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, resulting in a pro rata reduction for the Company from 35% to 25.7% for fiscal 2018 and a full reduction to 21% for fiscal 2019. As a change in tax law is accounted for in the period of enactment, we recognized a discrete benefit of $7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 due to the revaluation of U.S. net deferred tax liabilities to reflect the lower statutory rate. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 also reflected application of the Tax Act's lower federal statutory corporate tax rate to fiscal 2018 taxable income. The accounting for the impacts of the Tax Act was complete as of November 30, 2018, and we have not recorded any material adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 related to the Tax Act.\nOur effective tax rate from continuing operations in fiscal 2018 was a benefit of 12.4%. We reported a tax benefit on pre-tax income for fiscal 2018 primarily due to the release of valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets, resulting in recognition of discrete tax benefits totaling $37 million in fiscal 2018, and the impact of the Tax Act. The release of valuation allowances in fiscal 2018 was the result of sufficient positive evidence at the time, including cumulative income in our U.S. and Canadian tax jurisdictions in recent years and projections of future taxable income based primarily on our improved financial performance, that it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.\nWe assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis through an analysis of potential sources of future taxable income, including prior year taxable income available to absorb a carryback of tax losses, reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies, and forecasts of taxable income. We consider all negative and positive evidence, including the weight of the evidence, to determine if valuation allowances against deferred tax assets are required.\nWe continue to maintain valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets related to certain jurisdictions as a result of negative objective evidence, including the effects of historical losses in these tax jurisdictions, outweighing positive objective and subjective evidence, indicating that it is more-likely-than-not that the associated tax benefit will not be realized. Realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the associated tax jurisdictions in future years to benefit from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences and from the utilization of net operating losses. We will continue to regularly assess the realizability of deferred tax assets. Changes in historical earnings performance and future earnings projections, among other factors, may cause us to adjust our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, which would impact our results of operations in the period we determine that these factors have changed.\nSee Note 13 - Income Taxes in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe rely on cash provided by operating activities as a primary source of liquidity, supplemented by current cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facilities.\n36 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2019\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSources and Uses of Cash\nWe had cash balances of $12 million and $5 million as of August 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Cash balances are intended to be used primarily for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, investments and acquisitions. We use excess cash on hand to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facilities. As of August 31, 2019, debt was $105 million, compared to $107 million as of August 31, 2018, and debt, net of cash, was $93 million as of August 31, 2019 compared to $103 million as of August 31, 2018 (see the reconciliation of debt, net of cash, in Non-GAAP Financial Measures at the end of this Item 7).\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2019 was $145 million, compared to $160 million in fiscal 2018.\nSources of cash other than from earnings in fiscal 2019 included a $33 million decrease in inventories due to lower raw material purchase prices and timing of payments and sales and a $9 million decrease in accounts receivable due to lower selling prices and the timing of sales and collections. Uses of cash in fiscal 2019 included a $19 million decrease in accrued payroll and related liabilities primarily due to incentive compensation payments made in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and a $17 million decrease in accounts payable primarily due to lower raw material purchase prices and the timing of payments.\nSources of cash other than from earnings in fiscal 2018 included a $26 million increase in accounts payable due to higher raw material purchase prices and timing of payments, and a $11 million combined increase in other accrued liabilities and accrued payroll and related liabilities primarily due to increased incentive compensation liabilities and higher legal accruals. Uses of cash in fiscal 2018 included a $45 million increase in accounts receivable primarily due to increases in recycled metal and finished steel selling prices and sales volumes, as well as the timing of sales and collections, and a $24 million increase in inventories due to higher raw material purchase prices, higher volumes on hand, and the timing of purchases and sales.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2019 was $90 million, compared to $73 million in fiscal 2018.\nCash used in investing activities in fiscal 2019 included capital expenditures of $95 million to upgrade our equipment and infrastructure and for additional investments in nonferrous processing technologies and environmental and safety-related assets, compared to $78 million in the prior year. The significant majority of capital expenditures were associated with projects at AMR.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2019 was $47 million, compared with $88 million in fiscal 2018.\nUses of cash in both fiscal 2019 and 2018 included $21 million for the payment of dividends and $13 million and $17 million, respectively, for share repurchases. Uses of cash in fiscal 2019 also included $4 million in net repayments of debt, compared to $41 million in the prior year (refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures at the end of this Item 7).\nDebt\nFollowing is a summary of our outstanding balances and availability on credit facilities and long-term debt, exclusive of capital lease obligations (in thousands):\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Outstanding as of\nAugust 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Remaining\nAvailability\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bank secured revolving credit facilities(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 96,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 604,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other debt obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Remaining availability is net of $10 million of outstanding stand-by letters of credit as of August 31, 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n37 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc.

The $700 million credit facility includes a $50 million sublimit for letters of credit, a $25 million sublimit for swingline loans and a $50 million sublimit for multicurrency borrowings. Interest rates on outstanding indebtedness under the credit agreement are based, at our option, on either the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d), or the Canadian equivalent for C$ loans, plus a spread of between 1.25% and 2.75%, with the amount of the spread based on a pricing grid tied to our consolidated funded debt to EBITDA ratio, or the greater of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, or (c) the daily rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 1.75%, in each case plus a spread of between zero and 1.50% based on a pricing grid tied to our consolidated funded debt to EBITDA ratio. In addition, commitment fees are payable on the unused portion of the credit facilities at rates between 0.15% and 0.45% based on a pricing grid tied to our consolidated funded debt to EBITDA ratio.\nWe had borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities of $97 million and $100 million as of August 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on amounts outstanding under our credit facilities was 3.78% and 3.57% as of August 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe use the credit facilities to fund working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, investments and acquisitions. Our credit agreement contains various representations and warranties, events of default and financial and other customary covenants which limit (subject to certain exceptions) our ability to, among other things, incur or suffer to exist certain liens, make investments, incur or guaranty additional indebtedness, enter into consolidations, mergers, acquisitions, and sales of assets, make distributions and other restricted payments, change the nature of our business, engage in transactions with affiliates and enter into restrictive agreements, including agreements that restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions. The financial covenants under the credit agreement include (a) a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, defined as the four-quarter rolling sum of consolidated adjusted EBITDA less defined maintenance capital expenditures and certain environmental expenditures divided by consolidated fixed charges and (b) a consolidated leverage ratio, defined as consolidated funded indebtedness divided by the sum of consolidated net worth and consolidated funded indebtedness.\nAs of August 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the financial covenants under our credit agreement. The consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio was required to be no less than 1.50 to 1.00 and was 3.65 to 1.00 as of August 31, 2019. The consolidated leverage ratio was required to be no more than 0.55 to 1.00 and was 0.14 to 1.00 as of August 31, 2019.\nOur obligations under our credit agreement are guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries. The credit facilities and the related guarantees are secured by senior first priority liens on certain of our and our subsidiaries' assets, including equipment, inventory and accounts receivable.\nWhile we expect to remain in compliance with the financial covenants under our credit agreement, there can be no assurances that we will be able to do so in the event market conditions or other negative factors which adversely impact our results of operations and financial position lead to a trend of consolidated net losses. If we do not maintain compliance with our financial covenants and are unable to obtain an amendment or waiver from our lenders, a breach of a financial covenant would constitute an event of default and allow the lenders to exercise remedies under the agreements, the most severe of which is the termination of the credit facility under our committed bank credit agreement and acceleration of the amounts owed under the agreement. In such case, we would be required to evaluate available alternatives and take appropriate steps to obtain alternative funds. There can be no assurances that any such alternative funds, if sought, could be obtained or, if obtained, would be adequate or on acceptable terms.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures totaled $95 million for fiscal 2019, compared to $78 million for fiscal 2018. Capital expenditures in each of fiscal 2019 and 2018 were primarily to upgrade our equipment, facilities and infrastructure, and for additional investments in nonferrous processing technologies and environmental and safety-related assets. We currently plan to invest up to $125 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2020, including $60 million for investments in growth, including new nonferrous processing technology and to support volume initiatives and other growth projects, using cash generated from operations and available credit facilities.\nEnvironmental Compliance\nBuilding on our commitment to recycling and operating our business in an environmentally responsible manner, we continue to invest in facilities that improve our environmental presence in the communities in which we operate. As part of our capital expenditures discussed in the prior paragraph, we invested $36 million and $20 million for environmental projects in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. We plan to invest in the range of $15 million of our planned capital expenditures for environmental projects in fiscal 2020. These projects include investments in storm water systems and equipment to ensure ongoing compliance with air quality and other environmental regulations.\n38 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2019\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA\u201d) as one of the potentially responsible parties that own or operate or formerly owned or operated sites which are part of or adjacent to the Portland Harbor Superfund site (the Site\u201d). See Note 8 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a discussion of this matter, as well as other legacy environmental loss contingencies. We believe it is not possible to reasonably estimate the amount or range of costs which we are likely to or which it is reasonably possible that we will incur in connection with the Site, although such costs could be material to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. We have insurance policies that we believe will provide reimbursement for costs we incur for defense, remediation and mitigation for natural resource damages claims in connection with the Site, although there are no assurances that those policies will cover all of the costs which we may incur. Significant cash outflows in the future related to the Site could reduce the amounts available for borrowing that could otherwise be used for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, investments and acquisitions and could result in our failure to maintain compliance with certain covenants in our debt agreements, and could adversely impact our liquidity.\nDividends\nOn August 2, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a dividend for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 of $0.1875 per common share, which equates to an annual cash dividend of $0.75 per common share. Dividends of $0.75 per common share, totaling $21 million, were declared and paid during fiscal 2019.\nShare Repurchase Program\nPursuant to our amended share repurchase program, as of August 31, 2019, we have authorization to repurchase up to a remaining 759 thousand shares of our Class A common stock when we deem such repurchases to be appropriate. We may repurchase our common stock for a variety of reasons, such as to optimize our capital structure and to offset dilution related to share-based compensation arrangements. We consider several factors in determining whether to make share repurchases including, among other factors, our cash needs, the availability of funding, our future business plans and the market price of our stock. As of the beginning of fiscal 2018, we had repurchased approximately 7.2 million shares of our Class A common stock under the program. We repurchased approximately 516 thousand shares for a total of $17 million in open-market transactions in fiscal 2018, and approximately 527 thousand shares for a total of $13 million in open-market transactions in fiscal 2019.\nAssessment of Liquidity and Capital Resources\nHistorically, our available cash resources, internally generated funds, credit facilities and equity offerings have financed our acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other financing needs.\nWe generally believe our current cash resources, internally generated funds, existing credit facilities and access to the capital markets will provide adequate short-term and long-term liquidity needs for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, investments and acquisitions, joint ventures, debt service requirements, environmental obligations and other contingencies. However, in the event of a sustained market deterioration, we may need additional liquidity, which would require us to evaluate available alternatives and take appropriate steps to obtain sufficient additional funds. There can be no assurances that any such supplemental funding, if sought, could be obtained or, if obtained, would be adequate or on acceptable terms.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNone requiring disclosure pursuant to Item 303 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n39 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc.

An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. We deem critical accounting policies to be those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. We are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.\nOur critical accounting estimates include those related to inventories, long-lived assets, goodwill, environmental costs, revenue recognition, and income taxes.\nInventories\nOur inventories consist of processed and unprocessed scrap metal (ferrous, nonferrous, and mixed nonferrous recovered joint products arising from the manufacturing process), semi-finished steel products (billets), finished steel products (primarily rebar, wire rod, and merchant bar), used and salvaged vehicles, and supplies. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. We consider estimated future selling prices when determining the estimated net realizable value of our inventory. As we generally sell our recycled ferrous metal under contracts that provide for shipment within 30 to 60 days after the price is agreed, we utilize the selling prices under committed contracts and sales orders for determining the estimated net realizable value of quantities on hand that will be shipped under these contracts and sales orders.\n40 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2019\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe accounting process we use to record ferrous scrap metal quantities relies on significant estimates. With respect to estimating the quantities of unprocessed ferrous scrap metal inventory that are moved into production, we rely on weighed quantities of the processed ferrous material, adjusted for estimated metal recoveries and yields that are based on historical trends and other judgments by management. Actual recoveries and yields can vary depending on product quality, moisture content and source of the unprocessed metal. The Company's estimates are intended to reasonably reflect the quantities of unprocessed ferrous scrap metal that are used in the production of processed ferrous metal. To assist in validating the reasonableness of these estimates, we periodically review shrink factors and perform monthly physical inventories. Due to the inherent nature of our scrap metal inventories, including variations in product density, holding period and production processes utilized to manufacture the products, physical inventories will not necessarily detect all variances for scrap metal inventory such that estimates of quantities are required. To mitigate this risk, we further adjust our ferrous physical inventories when the volume of a commodity is low and a physical inventory count is deemed to more accurately estimate the remaining volume.\nLong-Lived Assets\nWe test long-lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment at the asset group level, which is determined based on the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. For our metals recycling operations reported within AMR, an asset group generally consists of the regional shredding and export operation along with surrounding feeder yards. For regions with no shredding and export operations, each metals recycling yard is an asset group. For our auto parts operations, generally each auto parts store is an asset group. The combined steel manufacturing and metals recycling operations within CSS are a single asset group. We test our asset groups for impairment when certain triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset group may be impaired. If the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable because it exceeds the estimate of future undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group, an impairment loss is recognized by the amount the carrying value exceeds its fair value, if any. The impairment loss is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of those assets, except that the loss allocated to an individual long-lived asset of the group shall not reduce the carrying amount of that asset below its fair value. Fair value is determined primarily using the cost and market approaches.\nWith respect to individual long-lived assets, changes in circumstances may merit a change in the estimated useful lives or salvage values of the assets, which are accounted for prospectively in the period of change. For such assets, the useful life is shortened based on our plans to dispose of or abandon the asset before the end of its original useful life and depreciation is accelerated beginning when that determination is made.\nGoodwill\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and upon the occurrence of certain triggering events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate that the fair value of goodwill may be impaired. Impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a \u2018component').\nWhen testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more-likely-than-not, we are then required to perform the quantitative impairment test, otherwise no further analysis is required. We also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. When performing the quantitative impairment test, we apply a one-step quantitative test and record the amount of goodwill impairment as the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nWe estimate the fair value of the reporting units using an income approach based on the present value of expected future cash flows utilizing a market-based weighted average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d) determined separately for each reporting unit. To estimate the present value of the cash flows that extend beyond the final year of the discounted cash flow model, we employ a terminal value technique, whereby we use estimated operating cash flows minus capital expenditures, adjust for changes in working capital requirements in the final year of the model, and then discount these estimated cash flows by the WACC to establish the terminal value.\nThe determination of fair value using the income approach requires judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions about expected future cash flows derived from internal forecasts and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions. Critical assumptions primarily include revenue growth rates driven by future commodity prices and volume expectations, operating margins, capital expenditures, working capital requirements, tax rates, terminal growth rates, discount rates, benefits associated with a taxable transaction and synergistic benefits available to market participants.\n41 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2019\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe also use a market approach based on earnings multiple data and our Company's market capitalization to corroborate our reporting units' valuations. We reconcile the Company's market capitalization to the aggregated estimated fair value of our reporting units, including consideration of a control premium representing the estimated amount a market participant would pay to obtain a controlling interest.\nAs a result of the inherent uncertainty associated with forming the estimates described above, actual results could differ from those estimates. Future events and changing market conditions may impact our assumptions as to future revenue and operating margin growth rates, market-based WACC, and other factors that may result in changes in our estimates of the reporting units' fair value. Although we believe the assumptions used in testing our reporting units' goodwill for impairment are reasonable, declines in market conditions from current levels, a trend of weaker than anticipated financial performance for the reporting unit with allocated goodwill, a decline in our share price from current levels for a sustained period of time, or an increase in the market-based WACC, among other factors, could significantly impact our impairment analysis and may result in future goodwill impairment charges that, if incurred, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we performed the annual goodwill impairment test as of July 1, 2019. As of the testing date, the balance of the Company's goodwill was $170 million, and all but $1 million of such balance was carried by a single reporting unit within AMR. We elected to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances led to a determination that it is more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit carrying goodwill is less than its carrying amount. As a result of the qualitative assessment, we concluded that it is not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of each reporting unit carrying goodwill is less than its carrying value as of the testing date and, therefore, no further impairment testing was required.\nEnvironmental Costs\nWe operate in industries that inherently possess environmental risks. To manage these risks, we employ both our own environmental staff and outside consultants. Environmental staff and finance personnel meet regularly to discuss environmental risks. We estimate future costs for known environmental remediation requirements and accrue for them on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that we have incurred a liability and the related costs can be reasonably estimated but the timing of incurring the estimated costs is unknown. The regulatory and government management of these projects is complex, which is one of the primary factors that make it difficult to assess the cost of potential and future remediation. When only a wide range of estimated amounts can be reasonably established and no other amount within the range is better than any other, the low end of the range is recorded in the financial statements. If further developments or resolution of an environmental matter result in facts and circumstances that are significantly different than the assumptions used to develop these liabilities, the accrual for environmental remediation could be materially understated or overstated. Adjustments to these liabilities are made when additional information becomes available that affects the estimated costs to study or remediate any environmental issues or when expenditures for which accruals are established are made. The factors we consider in the recognition and measurement of environmental liabilities include:\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Current regulations, both at the time the liability is established and during the course of the investigation or remediation process, which specify standards for acceptable remediation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Information about the site which becomes available as the site is studied and remediated;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The professional judgment of senior level internal staff, who take into account similar, recent instances of environmental remediation issues, and studies of our sites, among other considerations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Available technologies that can be used for remediation; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties and the extent of their responsibility for the costs of study and remediation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur accrued environmental liabilities as of August 31, 2019 included $1 million related to third party investigation costs for the Portland Harbor Superfund site. Because there has not been a determination of the specific remediation actions that will be required, the amount of natural resource damages or the allocation of costs of the investigations and any remedy and natural resource damages among the PRPs, we believe it is not possible to reasonably estimate the amount or range of costs which we are likely or which it is reasonably possible that we may incur in connection with the Site, although such costs could be material to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Therefore, no additional amounts have been accrued. Further, we have been notified that we are or may be a potentially responsible party at sites other than Portland Harbor which are currently or formerly owned or operated by us or at other sites where we may have responsibility for such costs due to past disposal or other activities.

Form 10-K 2019\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue upon satisfying our promises to transfer goods or services to customers under the terms of a contract. Nearly all of these promises, referred to as performance obligations, consist of the transfer of physical goods, including ferrous and nonferrous recycled scrap metal, auto bodies, auto parts, and finished steel products, to customers. These performance obligations are satisfied at the point in time the we transfer control of the goods to the customer, which in nearly all cases is when title to and risk of loss of the goods transfer to the customer. The timing of transfer of title and risk of loss is dictated by customary or explicitly stated contract terms. For example, we recognize revenue on partially loaded bulk shipments of ferrous recycled scrap metal when contractual terms support revenue recognition based on transfer of title and risk of loss. The significant majority of our sales involve transfer of control to the customer, and thus revenue recognition, before delivery to the customer's destination; for example, upon release of the goods to the shipper. Our bill-and-hold arrangements involve transfer of control to the customer when the goods have been segregated from other inventory at our facility and are ready for physical transfer to the customer. Shipping and handling activities that occur after a customer has obtained control of a good are accounted for as fulfillment costs rather than an additional promise in a contract. As such, shipping and handling consideration (freight revenue) is recognized when control of the goods transfers to the customer, and freight expense is accrued to cost of goods sold when the related revenue is recognized.\nIn certain regional markets, we enter into contracts whereby we arrange for, or broker, the transfer of scrap material between scrap suppliers and end customers. For transactions in which we obtain substantive control of the scrap material before the goods are transferred to the end customer, for example by arranging for the processing or warehousing of the material, we recognize revenue equal to the gross amount of the consideration we expect to receive from the customer (as principal). Alternatively, for transactions in which we do not obtain substantive control of the scrap material before the product is transferred to the end customer, we recognize revenue equal to the net amount of the consideration we expect to retain after paying the supplier for the purchase of the scrap metal (as agent). We are the agent in the transaction for the substantial majority of brokerage arrangements.\nNearly all of our sales contracts reflect market pricing at the time the contract is executed, are one year or less, and generally provide for shipment within 30 to 60 days after the price has been agreed upon with the customer. Our retail auto parts sales are at listed prices and are recognized at the point of sale.\nWe recognize revenue based on contractually stated selling prices and quantities shipped, net of sales tax, and adjusted for estimated claims and discounts. Claims are customary in the recycled scrap metal industry and arise from variances in the quantity or quality of delivered products. Revenue adjustments may be required if the settlement of claims exceeds original estimates. Discounts offered to certain finished steel customers qualify as variable consideration as the discounts are contingent upon future events. Variable consideration arising from discounts is recognized upon the transfer of finished steel products to customers based upon either the expected value or the most likely amount. We experience very few sales returns and, therefore, no material provisions for returns have been made when sales are recognized.\nIncome Taxes\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act\nOn December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed and enacted into law comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Tax Act\u201d), which, except for certain provisions, is effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. The Tax Act's primary change is a reduction in the federal statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, resulting in a pro rata reduction of the Company's tax rate from 35% to 25.7% for fiscal 2018 and a full reduction to 21% for fiscal 2019. Other pertinent changes in the Tax Act include, but are not limited to, the acceleration of deductions for qualified property placed in service after September 27, 2017, limitations to the deductibility of some executive compensation, and the elimination of the deduction for qualified domestic production activities. Changes in the Tax Act that did not significantly impact us upon enactment include the implementation of a modified territorial tax system and other modifications to how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax, including a tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income which we have elected to treat as period costs if and when incurred.\nAs a change in tax law is accounted for in the period of enactment, we recognized a discrete benefit in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 due to the revaluation of U.S. net deferred tax liabilities to reflect the lower statutory rate. We also recorded a benefit in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 resulting from application of the lower federal statutory corporate tax rate to fiscal 2018 projected taxable income at that time. The accounting for the impacts of the Tax Act was complete as of November 30, 2018, and we did not record any material adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 related to the Tax Act.\n43 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2019\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nValuation Allowances\nWe assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis through an analysis of potential sources of future taxable income, including prior year taxable income available to absorb a carryback of tax losses, reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies, and forecasts of taxable income. We consider all negative and positive evidence, including the weight of the evidence, to determine if valuation allowances against deferred tax assets are required. In fiscal 2018, we released valuation allowances against certain U.S. federal and state and Canadian deferred tax assets resulting in discrete tax benefits totaling $37 million. The release of these valuation allowances was the result of sufficient positive evidence at the time, including cumulative income in recent years and projections of future taxable income based primarily on our improved financial performance, that it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. We continue to maintain valuation allowances against certain U.S. federal, state, Canadian and all Puerto Rican deferred tax assets.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nFor a description of recent accounting pronouncements that may have an impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, see Note 3 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nDebt, net of cash\nDebt, net of cash is the difference between (i) the sum of long-term debt and short-term borrowings (i.e., total debt) and (ii) cash and cash equivalents.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis section includes a discussion of our operations for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2019 and 2018. The following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes thereto in Part II, Item 8 of this report and the Selected Financial Data contained in Part II, Item 6 of this report.\nFor discussion of our results of operations for fiscal year 2017 including comparison to fiscal 2018 refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2018, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 24, 2018.\nBusiness\nFounded in 1906, Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. ( SSI\u201d), an Oregon corporation, is one of North America's largest recyclers of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal, including end-of-life vehicles, and a manufacturer of finished steel products.\nOur internal organizational and reporting structure includes two operating and reportable segments: the Auto and Metals Recycling ( AMR\u201d) business and the Cascade Steel and Scrap ( CSS\u201d) business.\nWe use segment operating income to measure our segment performance. We do not allocate corporate interest income and expense, income taxes, and other income and expense to our reportable segments. Certain expenses related to shared services that support operational activities and transactions are allocated from Corporate to the segments. Unallocated Corporate expense consists primarily of expense for management and certain administrative services that benefit both reportable segments. In addition, we do not allocate certain items to segment operating income because management does not include the information in its measurement of the performance of the operating segments. Such unallocated items include restructuring charges and other exit-related activities, charges (net of recoveries) related to legacy environmental matters, and provisions for certain legal matters. Because of the unallocated income and expense, the operating income of each reportable segment does not reflect the operating income the reportable segment would report as a stand-alone business. The results of discontinued operations are excluded from segment operating income and are presented separately, net of tax, from the results of ongoing operations for all periods presented. See Note 16 - Segment Information in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a discussion of the primary activities of each reportable segment, total assets by reportable segment, operating results from continuing operations by reportable segment, revenues from external customers and concentration of sales to foreign countries.\nOur results of operations depend in large part on the demand and prices for recycled metal in foreign and domestic markets and on the supply of raw materials, including end-of-life vehicles, available to be processed at our facilities. We respond to changes in selling prices for processed metal by seeking to adjust purchase prices for unprocessed scrap metal in order to manage the impact on our operating income. We believe we generally benefit from sustained periods of rising recycled scrap metal selling prices, which allow us to better maintain or increase both operating income and unprocessed scrap metal flow into our facilities. When recycled scrap metal selling prices decline, particularly for a sustained period, our operating margins typically compress.\nOur deep water port facilities on both the East and West Coasts of the U.S. (in Everett, Massachusetts; Providence, Rhode Island; Oakland, California; Tacoma, Washington; and Portland, Oregon) and access to public deep water port facilities (in Kapolei, Hawaii and Salinas, Puerto Rico) allow us to efficiently meet the global demand for recycled ferrous metal by enabling us to ship bulk cargoes to steel manufacturers located in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia, North America, Central America, and South America. Our exports of nonferrous recycled metal are shipped in containers through various public docks to specialty steelmakers, foundries, aluminum sheet and ingot manufacturers, copper refineries and smelters, brass and bronze ingot manufacturers, wire and cable producers, wholesalers, and other recycled metal processors globally. We also transport both ferrous and nonferrous metals by truck, rail and barge in order to transfer scrap metal between our facilities for further processing, to load shipments at our export facilities, and to meet regional domestic demand.\nOur results of operations also depend on the demand and prices for our finished steel products, the manufacture of which uses internally sourced ferrous recycled scrap metal as the primary feedstock, as well as other raw materials. Our steel mill in Oregon sells to industrial customers primarily in North America.\n29 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2019\n SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. \nOur quarterly operating results fluctuate based on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, changes in market conditions for ferrous and nonferrous recycled metal and finished steel products, the supply of scrap metal in our domestic markets, and varying demand for used auto parts from our self-service retail stores. Certain of these factors are influenced, to a degree, by the impact of seasonal changes including severe weather conditions, which can impact the timing of shipments and inhibit construction activity utilizing our products, scrap metal collection at our facilities and production levels in our yards, and retail admissions and parts sales at our auto parts stores. Further, trade actions, including tariffs and any retaliation by affected countries, and licensing and inspection requirements can impact the level of profitability on sales of our products and, in certain cases, impede or restrict our ability to sell to certain export markets or require us to direct our sales to alternative market destinations, which can cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate. For further information regarding the potential impact of changing conditions in global markets including the impact of tariffs, quotas and other trade actions and import restrictions on our business and results of operations, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report.\nStrategic Priorities\nAs we continue to closely monitor economic conditions, we remain focused on the following core strategies and plans to meet our business goals and objectives:\n \u2022 Long-term expansion of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal supply and processing, sales volumes and operating margins; \n \u2022 Technology investments and process improvements to increase the separation and recovery of recycled materials from our shredding process and to expand product optionality; \n \u2022 Productivity and continuous improvement initiatives to ensure the safety of our employees, increase operating efficiency and effectiveness, advance sustainable business practices, improve natural resource stewardship, and reduce operating expense; \n \u2022 Use of our seven deep water ports and ground-based logistics network to directly access customers domestically and internationally to meet demand for our products wherever it is greatest; \n \u2022 Further optimization of our integrated recycling and steel manufacturing operating platforms to maximize opportunities for synergies, cost efficiencies and volumes; and \n \u2022 Increase market share through initiatives to maximize volumes and through selective partnerships, alliances and acquisitions. \nKey economic factors and trends affecting the industries in which we operate\nWe sell recycled metals to the global steel industry for the production of finished steel. Our financial results largely depend on supply of raw materials in the U.S. and Western Canada and demand for recycled metal in foreign and domestic markets and for finished steel products in the Western U.S. Demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions. The timing and magnitude of the economic cycles in the industries in which our products are used, including global steel manufacturing and nonresidential and infrastructure construction in the U.S., are difficult to predict. Global economic conditions, changes in supply and demand conditions, the strength of the U.S. dollar, the availability and price of raw material alternatives, and trade actions such as tariffs affect market prices for and sales volumes of recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal in global markets and steel products in the Western U.S. and can have a significant impact on the results of operations for our reportable segments.\nBeginning in the second half of fiscal 2016 through fiscal 2018, the combination of improved U.S. and global economic growth, lower Chinese steel exports, and increased use of EAFs by steel manufacturers in other export markets contributed to improved demand and prices for ferrous recycled scrap metal, positively impacting our operating results. In fiscal 2018, selling prices for ferrous recycled metal rose during the first three quarters followed by a modest decrease in the fourth quarter. The higher price environment for scrap metal during fiscal 2018 together with benefits from increased sales diversification, commercial initiatives to improve supply channels and a strong U.S. economy led to an increase in scrap supply flows into our facilities, including end-of-life vehicles, resulting in higher processed volumes compared to recent prior years. The higher average selling prices supported an expansion of the spread between direct purchase costs and selling prices of ferrous recycled metal compared to the prior year. Our operating margins also benefited from improved volumes of nonferrous material from end-of-life vehicles and the shredding process, partially offset by operating margin compression experienced near the end of fiscal 2018 as a result of a decrease in average net selling prices for certain nonferrous products driven primarily by the global impact of new regulations and measures put into place by China during the year, including import regulations and tariffs on U.S. scrap imports.\n30 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2019\n SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. \nIn fiscal 2018, our CSS business benefited from reduced price pressure from steel imports, the impact of U.S. tariffs on steel imports, and steady demand for finished steel products in the West Coast markets which contributed to higher selling prices for our finished steel products. CSS experienced improved metal margins in fiscal 2018 from selling prices increasing faster than raw material purchase prices which, in combination with operational synergies gained following the integration of our steel manufacturing and Oregon metals recycling operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, led to significantly improved results compared to the prior year.\nIn fiscal 2019, weaker market conditions for recycled metals, primarily due to slower global economic growth and the effects of tariffs and other regulatory measures, resulted in lower average net selling prices for our ferrous and nonferrous recycled metal products and lower ferrous export sales volumes compared to fiscal 2018. Operating results at AMR in fiscal 2019 decreased significantly compared to fiscal 2018 as a result of operating margin compression from the decline in average net selling prices for our recycled metal products which outpaced the reduction in purchase costs for raw materials. Average net selling prices for ferrous recycled metal have trended downwards since the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Domestic ferrous sales volumes in fiscal 2019 increased compared to the prior year, reflecting strong demand in the U.S. market particularly during the first half of fiscal 2019, partially offsetting the adverse impact of the weaker ferrous export market conditions and lower average net selling prices. Nonferrous average net selling prices in fiscal 2019 decreased significantly compared to fiscal 2018 primarily reflecting reduced demand for nonferrous products globally, as well as the continued impact of Chinese import restrictions and tariffs on certain nonferrous products put into place starting in the second half of fiscal 2018.\nIn fiscal 2019, CSS benefited from reduced pressure from steel imports and higher net selling prices for finished steel products particularly during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, resulting in higher finished steel margins in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior year. However, these benefits were more than offset by lower finished steel and recycled metal sales volumes and increased steelmaking consumables costs compared to fiscal 2018, resulting in lower operating results at CSS year-over-year.\nExecutive Overview of Financial Results\nWe generated consolidated revenues of $2.1 billion in fiscal 2019, a decrease of 10% from the $2.4 billion of consolidated revenues generated in fiscal 2018, primarily reflecting weaker market conditions for recycled metals globally resulting in lower average net selling prices for our ferrous and nonferrous products compared to the prior year. In fiscal 2019, the average net selling prices for ferrous and nonferrous recycled metal at AMR were 9% and 18% lower, respectively, compared to the prior year. Steel revenues in fiscal 2019 were flat compared to the prior year reflecting the impact of higher average net selling prices for our finished steel products offset by lower finished steel sales volumes compared to the prior year.\nConsolidated operating income was $84 million in fiscal 2019, compared to $149 million in fiscal 2018. AMR reported operating income in fiscal 2019 of $96 million, compared to $169 million in the prior year. The decrease in AMR operating results in fiscal 2019 was primarily the result of operating margin compression from the decline in average net selling prices for our ferrous and nonferrous products which outpaced the reduction in purchase costs for raw materials, partially offset by the benefits from productivity initiatives and higher nonferrous sales volumes compared to the prior year. The lower average ferrous selling prices in fiscal 2019 primarily reflected the weaker price environment for recycled metals in our domestic markets and the effects of tariffs and other regulatory measures on demand for recycled metals in our export markets. The lower average nonferrous selling prices in fiscal 2019 primarily resulted from reduced demand for nonferrous products globally, as well as the continued effects of Chinese import restrictions and tariffs on certain nonferrous products put into place starting in the second half of fiscal 2018. The spread between direct purchase costs and selling prices of ferrous recycled metal at AMR in fiscal 2019 contracted by approximately 4% compared to the prior year and average net selling prices for AMR's nonferrous joint products recovered from the shredding process, comprising primarily zorba, decreased by 26% in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior year, contributing significantly to the operating margin compression at AMR in fiscal 2019. CSS reported operating income of $32 million in fiscal 2019, compared to $38 million in the prior year, reflecting lower sales of recycled scrap metal and lower finished steel sales volumes partially offset by higher finished steel margins driven by the effects of the higher price environment, and the benefits from productivity initiatives.\nConsolidated selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expense in fiscal 2019 decreased by $17 million, or 8%, compared to the prior year primarily due to decreased employee-related expenses, including from lower incentive compensation accruals, and decreased environmental-related and legal and professional services expenses.\nIn fiscal 2019, we undertook productivity initiatives aimed at delivering $35 million in annual benefits in order to mitigate the weaker price environment in the ferrous and nonferrous markets. We expect these benefits will be achieved through a combination of production cost efficiencies, reductions in SG&A expense and increases in retail sales. Of the total, approximately 75% of the targeted benefits are in AMR with the remainder split between CSS and Corporate. We achieved over 80% of the total targeted benefits in fiscal 2019 with the full amount expected to be achieved in fiscal 2020. For fiscal 2019, we achieved approximately $30 million in benefits as a result of these initiatives.\n31 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2019\n SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. \nNet income from continuing operations attributable to SSI shareholders in fiscal 2019 was $57 million, or $2.01 per diluted share, compared to $156 million, or $5.46 per diluted share, in the prior year. Adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to SSI shareholders in fiscal 2019 was $61 million, or $2.16 per diluted share, compared to $161 million, or $5.64 per diluted share, in the prior year. Reported and adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to SSI shareholders in fiscal 2018 included discrete income tax benefits totaling $37 million, or $1.30 per diluted share, related to the release of valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets, and an income tax benefit of $7 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, related to the impacts of U.S. federal tax legislation enacted during the year. See the reconciliation of adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to SSI shareholders in Non-GAAP Financial Measures at the end of this Item 7.\nThe following items further highlight selected liquidity and capital structure metrics:\n \u2022 Net cash provided by operating activities of $145 million in fiscal 2019, compared to $160 million in the prior year; \n \u2022 Debt of $105 million as of August 31, 2019, compared to $107 million as of the prior year-end; \n \u2022 Debt, net of cash, of $93 million as of August 31, 2019, compared to $103 million as of the prior year-end (see the reconciliation of debt, net of cash, in Non-GAAP Financial Measures at the end of this Item 7). \n \u2022 Share repurchases totaling $13 million in fiscal 2019, compared to $17 million in the prior year. \n32 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2019\n SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. \nResults of Operations\n\nNM = Not Meaningful\n (1) AMR sells a small portion of its recycled ferrous metal to CSS at prices that approximate local market rates. These intercompany revenues and cost of goods sold are eliminated in consolidation. \n (2) Corporate expense consists primarily of unallocated expenses for management and certain administrative services that benefit both reportable segments. \n (3) Restructuring charges consist of expense for severance, contract termination and other restructuring costs that management does not include in its measurement of the performance of the reportable segments. Other exit-related activities consist of asset impairments and accelerated depreciation, net of gains on exit-related disposals, related to site closures. \n (4) Intercompany profits are not recognized until the finished products are sold to third parties; therefore, intercompany profit is eliminated while the products remain in inventory. \n33 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2019\n SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. \nWe operate our business across two reportable segments: AMR and CSS. Additional financial information relating to these reportable segments is contained in Note 16 - Segment Information in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nAuto and Metals Recycling (AMR)\n\nLT = Long Ton, which is equivalent to 2,240 pounds\nNM = Not meaningful\n (1) Price information is shown after netting the cost of freight incurred to deliver the product to the customer. \n (2) Average sales price and volume information excludes platinum group metals ( PGMs\u201d) in catalytic converters. \n (3) Cars purchased by auto parts stores only. \nAMR Segment Revenues\nRevenues in fiscal 2019 decreased by 12% compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to weaker market conditions for recycled metal globally, resulting in lower average net selling prices for our ferrous and nonferrous products compared to fiscal 2018. Despite the lower price environment, domestic ferrous sales volumes in fiscal 2019 increased by 17% compared to the prior year due to increased U.S. steel mill utilization, partially offsetting the adverse impact of the weaker ferrous export market conditions in the year. Nonferrous revenues in fiscal 2019 decreased by 11% compared to the prior year, as average net selling prices decreased by 18% compared to fiscal 2018, primarily reflecting reduced demand for nonferrous products globally, as well as the continued impact of Chinese import restrictions and tariffs on certain nonferrous products put into place starting in the second half of fiscal 2018.\n34 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2019\n SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. \nAMR Segment Operating Income\nOperating income for fiscal 2019 was $96 million, compared to $169 million in fiscal 2018. The decrease in AMR operating results in fiscal 2019 was primarily the result of operating margin compression from the decline in average net selling prices for our ferrous and nonferrous products which outpaced the reduction in purchase costs for raw materials. The lower average ferrous and nonferrous selling prices in fiscal 2019 reflect the effects of tariffs and other regulatory measures on demand for recycled metals in our export markets, the weaker price environment for recycled metals in our domestic markets, and reduced demand for nonferrous products globally. The spread between direct purchase costs and selling prices of ferrous recycled metal at AMR in fiscal 2019 contracted by approximately 4% compared to the prior year and average net selling prices for AMR's nonferrous joint products recovered from the shredding process, comprising primarily zorba, decreased by 26% in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior year, contributing significantly to the operating margin compression at AMR in fiscal 2019. The adverse effects of lower average net selling prices for recycled metals were partially offset by benefits from productivity initiatives, higher nonferrous sales volumes compared to the prior year, and positive contributions from a limited-duration contract. This contract, which was substantially complete at the end of fiscal 2019, provided a high margin source of supply and benefited AMR operating income by $20 million for fiscal 2019, compared to $23 million for the prior year. AMR SG&A expense in fiscal 2019 decreased by $2 million, or 2%, compared to the prior year primarily due to lower employee-related expenses, including from reduced incentive compensation accruals.\nCascade Steel and Scrap (CSS)\n\nST = Short Ton, which is equivalent to 2,000 pounds\n (1) Steel revenues include primarily sales of finished steel products, semi-finished goods (billets) and manufacturing scrap. \n (2) Recycling revenues include primarily sales of ferrous and nonferrous recycled scrap metal to export markets. \n (3) Price information is shown after netting the cost of freight incurred to deliver the product to the customer. \n (4) Rolling mill utilization is based on effective annual production capacity under current conditions of 580 thousand tons of finished steel products. \nCSS Segment Revenues\nRevenues in fiscal 2019 decreased by $21 million, or 4%, compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to significantly lower sales of ferrous recycled scrap metal. Steel revenues were flat compared to the prior year reflecting the impact of higher average net selling prices for our finished steel products offset by lower finished steel sales volumes compared to the prior year.\nCSS Segment Operating Income\nOperating income for fiscal 2019 was $32 million, compared to operating income of $38 million in the prior year. Decreased operating results in fiscal 2019 primarily reflect the impact of lower finished steel sales volumes and recycled scrap metal sales, partially offset by higher finished steel margins driven by the effects of the higher price environment, and the benefits from productivity initiatives.\nCorporate\nCorporate SG&A expense decreased by $15 million or 25%, compared to the prior year primarily due to decreased employee-related expenses, including from lower incentive compensation accruals, and decreased environmental-related and legal and professional services expenses, partially offset by a $2 million charge related to the settlement of a wage and hour class action lawsuit.\n35 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2019\n SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. \nProductivity Initiatives\nIn fiscal 2019, we undertook productivity initiatives aimed at delivering $35 million in annual benefits in order to mitigate the weaker price environment in the ferrous and nonferrous markets. We expect these benefits will be achieved through a combination of production cost efficiencies, reductions in SG&A expense and increases in retail sales. Of the total, approximately 75% of the targeted benefits are in AMR with the remainder split between CSS and Corporate. We achieved over 80% of the total targeted benefits in fiscal 2019 with the full amount expected to be achieved in fiscal 2020. For fiscal 2019, we achieved approximately $30 million in benefits as a result of these initiatives.\nIncome Tax\n\nOn December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed and enacted into law comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Tax Act\u201d), which, except for certain provisions, is effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. The Tax Act's primary change is a reduction in the federal statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, resulting in a pro rata reduction for the Company from 35% to 25.7% for fiscal 2018 and a full reduction to 21% for fiscal 2019. As a change in tax law is accounted for in the period of enactment, we recognized a discrete benefit of $7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 due to the revaluation of U.S. net deferred tax liabilities to reflect the lower statutory rate. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 also reflected application of the Tax Act's lower federal statutory corporate tax rate to fiscal 2018 taxable income. The accounting for the impacts of the Tax Act was complete as of November 30, 2018, and we have not recorded any material adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 related to the Tax Act.\nOur effective tax rate from continuing operations in fiscal 2018 was a benefit of 12.4%. We reported a tax benefit on pre-tax income for fiscal 2018 primarily due to the release of valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets, resulting in recognition of discrete tax benefits totaling $37 million in fiscal 2018, and the impact of the Tax Act. The release of valuation allowances in fiscal 2018 was the result of sufficient positive evidence at the time, including cumulative income in our U.S. and Canadian tax jurisdictions in recent years and projections of future taxable income based primarily on our improved financial performance, that it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.\nWe assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis through an analysis of potential sources of future taxable income, including prior year taxable income available to absorb a carryback of tax losses, reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies, and forecasts of taxable income. We consider all negative and positive evidence, including the weight of the evidence, to determine if valuation allowances against deferred tax assets are required.\nWe continue to maintain valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets related to certain jurisdictions as a result of negative objective evidence, including the effects of historical losses in these tax jurisdictions, outweighing positive objective and subjective evidence, indicating that it is more-likely-than-not that the associated tax benefit will not be realized. Realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the associated tax jurisdictions in future years to benefit from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences and from the utilization of net operating losses. We will continue to regularly assess the realizability of deferred tax assets. Changes in historical earnings performance and future earnings projections, among other factors, may cause us to adjust our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, which would impact our results of operations in the period we determine that these factors have changed.\nSee Note 13 - Income Taxes in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe rely on cash provided by operating activities as a primary source of liquidity, supplemented by current cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facilities.\n36 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2019\n SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. \nSources and Uses of Cash\nWe had cash balances of $12 million and $5 million as of August 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Cash balances are intended to be used primarily for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, investments and acquisitions. We use excess cash on hand to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facilities. As of August 31, 2019, debt was $105 million, compared to $107 million as of August 31, 2018, and debt, net of cash, was $93 million as of August 31, 2019 compared to $103 million as of August 31, 2018 (see the reconciliation of debt, net of cash, in Non-GAAP Financial Measures at the end of this Item 7).\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2019 was $145 million, compared to $160 million in fiscal 2018.\nSources of cash other than from earnings in fiscal 2019 included a $33 million decrease in inventories due to lower raw material purchase prices and timing of payments and sales and a $9 million decrease in accounts receivable due to lower selling prices and the timing of sales and collections. Uses of cash in fiscal 2019 included a $19 million decrease in accrued payroll and related liabilities primarily due to incentive compensation payments made in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and a $17 million decrease in accounts payable primarily due to lower raw material purchase prices and the timing of payments.\nSources of cash other than from earnings in fiscal 2018 included a $26 million increase in accounts payable due to higher raw material purchase prices and timing of payments, and a $11 million combined increase in other accrued liabilities and accrued payroll and related liabilities primarily due to increased incentive compensation liabilities and higher legal accruals. Uses of cash in fiscal 2018 included a $45 million increase in accounts receivable primarily due to increases in recycled metal and finished steel selling prices and sales volumes, as well as the timing of sales and collections, and a $24 million increase in inventories due to higher raw material purchase prices, higher volumes on hand, and the timing of purchases and sales.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2019 was $90 million, compared to $73 million in fiscal 2018.\nCash used in investing activities in fiscal 2019 included capital expenditures of $95 million to upgrade our equipment and infrastructure and for additional investments in nonferrous processing technologies and environmental and safety-related assets, compared to $78 million in the prior year. The significant majority of capital expenditures were associated with projects at AMR.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2019 was $47 million, compared with $88 million in fiscal 2018.\nUses of cash in both fiscal 2019 and 2018 included $21 million for the payment of dividends and $13 million and $17 million, respectively, for share repurchases. Uses of cash in fiscal 2019 also included $4 million in net repayments of debt, compared to $41 million in the prior year (refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures at the end of this Item 7).\nDebt\nFollowing is a summary of our outstanding balances and availability on credit facilities and long-term debt, exclusive of capital lease obligations (in thousands):\n\n (1) Remaining availability is net of $10 million of outstanding stand-by letters of credit as of August 31, 2019. \n37 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2019\n SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. \nOur senior secured revolving credit facilities, which provide for revolving loans of $700 million and C$15 million, mature in August 2023 pursuant to a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and other lenders party thereto. The $700 million credit facility includes a $50 million sublimit for letters of credit, a $25 million sublimit for swingline loans and a $50 million sublimit for multicurrency borrowings. Interest rates on outstanding indebtedness under the credit agreement are based, at our option, on either the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d), or the Canadian equivalent for C$ loans, plus a spread of between 1.25% and 2.75%, with the amount of the spread based on a pricing grid tied to our consolidated funded debt to EBITDA ratio, or the greater of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, or (c) the daily rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 1.75%, in each case plus a spread of between zero and 1.50% based on a pricing grid tied to our consolidated funded debt to EBITDA ratio. In addition, commitment fees are payable on the unused portion of the credit facilities at rates between 0.15% and 0.45% based on a pricing grid tied to our consolidated funded debt to EBITDA ratio.\nWe had borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities of $97 million and $100 million as of August 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on amounts outstanding under our credit facilities was 3.78% and 3.57% as of August 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe use the credit facilities to fund working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, investments and acquisitions. Our credit agreement contains various representations and warranties, events of default and financial and other customary covenants which limit (subject to certain exceptions) our ability to, among other things, incur or suffer to exist certain liens, make investments, incur or guaranty additional indebtedness, enter into consolidations, mergers, acquisitions, and sales of assets, make distributions and other restricted payments, change the nature of our business, engage in transactions with affiliates and enter into restrictive agreements, including agreements that restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions. The financial covenants under the credit agreement include (a) a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, defined as the four-quarter rolling sum of consolidated adjusted EBITDA less defined maintenance capital expenditures and certain environmental expenditures divided by consolidated fixed charges and (b) a consolidated leverage ratio, defined as consolidated funded indebtedness divided by the sum of consolidated net worth and consolidated funded indebtedness.\nAs of August 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the financial covenants under our credit agreement. The consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio was required to be no less than 1.50 to 1.00 and was 3.65 to 1.00 as of August 31, 2019. The consolidated leverage ratio was required to be no more than 0.55 to 1.00 and was 0.14 to 1.00 as of August 31, 2019.\nOur obligations under our credit agreement are guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries. The credit facilities and the related guarantees are secured by senior first priority liens on certain of our and our subsidiaries' assets, including equipment, inventory and accounts receivable.\nWhile we expect to remain in compliance with the financial covenants under our credit agreement, there can be no assurances that we will be able to do so in the event market conditions or other negative factors which adversely impact our results of operations and financial position lead to a trend of consolidated net losses. If we do not maintain compliance with our financial covenants and are unable to obtain an amendment or waiver from our lenders, a breach of a financial covenant would constitute an event of default and allow the lenders to exercise remedies under the agreements, the most severe of which is the termination of the credit facility under our committed bank credit agreement and acceleration of the amounts owed under the agreement. In such case, we would be required to evaluate available alternatives and take appropriate steps to obtain alternative funds. There can be no assurances that any such alternative funds, if sought, could be obtained or, if obtained, would be adequate or on acceptable terms.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures totaled $95 million for fiscal 2019, compared to $78 million for fiscal 2018. Capital expenditures in each of fiscal 2019 and 2018 were primarily to upgrade our equipment, facilities and infrastructure, and for additional investments in nonferrous processing technologies and environmental and safety-related assets. We currently plan to invest up to $125 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2020, including $60 million for investments in growth, including new nonferrous processing technology and to support volume initiatives and other growth projects, using cash generated from operations and available credit facilities.\nEnvironmental Compliance\nBuilding on our commitment to recycling and operating our business in an environmentally responsible manner, we continue to invest in facilities that improve our environmental presence in the communities in which we operate. As part of our capital expenditures discussed in the prior paragraph, we invested $36 million and $20 million for environmental projects in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. We plan to invest in the range of $15 million of our planned capital expenditures for environmental projects in fiscal 2020. These projects include investments in storm water systems and equipment to ensure ongoing compliance with air quality and other environmental regulations.\n38 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2019\n SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. \nWe have been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA\u201d) as one of the potentially responsible parties that own or operate or formerly owned or operated sites which are part of or adjacent to the Portland Harbor Superfund site (the Site\u201d). See Note 8 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a discussion of this matter, as well as other legacy environmental loss contingencies. We believe it is not possible to reasonably estimate the amount or range of costs which we are likely to or which it is reasonably possible that we will incur in connection with the Site, although such costs could be material to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. We have insurance policies that we believe will provide reimbursement for costs we incur for defense, remediation and mitigation for natural resource damages claims in connection with the Site, although there are no assurances that those policies will cover all of the costs which we may incur. Significant cash outflows in the future related to the Site could reduce the amounts available for borrowing that could otherwise be used for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, investments and acquisitions and could result in our failure to maintain compliance with certain covenants in our debt agreements, and could adversely impact our liquidity.\nDividends\nOn August 2, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a dividend for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 of $0.1875 per common share, which equates to an annual cash dividend of $0.75 per common share. Dividends of $0.75 per common share, totaling $21 million, were declared and paid during fiscal 2019.\nShare Repurchase Program\nPursuant to our amended share repurchase program, as of August 31, 2019, we have authorization to repurchase up to a remaining 759 thousand shares of our Class A common stock when we deem such repurchases to be appropriate. We may repurchase our common stock for a variety of reasons, such as to optimize our capital structure and to offset dilution related to share-based compensation arrangements. We consider several factors in determining whether to make share repurchases including, among other factors, our cash needs, the availability of funding, our future business plans and the market price of our stock. As of the beginning of fiscal 2018, we had repurchased approximately 7.2 million shares of our Class A common stock under the program. We repurchased approximately 516 thousand shares for a total of $17 million in open-market transactions in fiscal 2018, and approximately 527 thousand shares for a total of $13 million in open-market transactions in fiscal 2019.\nAssessment of Liquidity and Capital Resources\nHistorically, our available cash resources, internally generated funds, credit facilities and equity offerings have financed our acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other financing needs.\nWe generally believe our current cash resources, internally generated funds, existing credit facilities and access to the capital markets will provide adequate short-term and long-term liquidity needs for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, investments and acquisitions, joint ventures, debt service requirements, environmental obligations and other contingencies. However, in the event of a sustained market deterioration, we may need additional liquidity, which would require us to evaluate available alternatives and take appropriate steps to obtain sufficient additional funds. There can be no assurances that any such supplemental funding, if sought, could be obtained or, if obtained, would be adequate or on acceptable terms.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNone requiring disclosure pursuant to Item 303 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n39 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2019\n SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. \nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nWe have certain contractual obligations to make future payments. The following table summarizes these future obligations as of August 31, 2019 (in thousands):\n\n (1) Long-term debt represents the principal amounts of all outstanding long-term debt, maturities of which extend to 2027. \n (2) Interest payments on long-term debt are based on interest rates in effect as of August 31, 2019. As contractual interest rates and the amount of debt outstanding is variable in certain cases, actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided. \n (3) Purchase obligations include all enforceable, legally binding agreements to purchase goods or services that specify all significant terms, regardless of the duration of the agreement. \n (4) Other contractual obligations consist of pension funding obligations and other accrued liabilities. \nWe maintain stand-by letters of credit to provide support for certain obligations, including workers' compensation and performance bonds. At August 31, 2019, we had $10 million outstanding under these arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make certain judgments, estimates, and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. We deem critical accounting policies to be those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. We are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.\nOur critical accounting estimates include those related to inventories, long-lived assets, goodwill, environmental costs, revenue recognition, and income taxes.\nInventories\nOur inventories consist of processed and unprocessed scrap metal (ferrous, nonferrous, and mixed nonferrous recovered joint products arising from the manufacturing process), semi-finished steel products (billets), finished steel products (primarily rebar, wire rod, and merchant bar), used and salvaged vehicles, and supplies. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. We consider estimated future selling prices when determining the estimated net realizable value of our inventory. As we generally sell our recycled ferrous metal under contracts that provide for shipment within 30 to 60 days after the price is agreed, we utilize the selling prices under committed contracts and sales orders for determining the estimated net realizable value of quantities on hand that will be shipped under these contracts and sales orders.\n40 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2019\n SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. \nThe accounting process we use to record ferrous scrap metal quantities relies on significant estimates. With respect to estimating the quantities of unprocessed ferrous scrap metal inventory that are moved into production, we rely on weighed quantities of the processed ferrous material, adjusted for estimated metal recoveries and yields that are based on historical trends and other judgments", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis section includes a discussion of our operations for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2019 and 2018. The following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes thereto in Part II, Item 8 of this report and the Selected Financial Data contained in Part II, Item 6 of this report.\nFor discussion of our results of operations for fiscal year 2017 including comparison to fiscal 2018 refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2018, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 24, 2018.\nBusiness\nFounded in 1906, Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. ( SSI\u201d), an Oregon corporation, is one of North America's largest recyclers of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal, including end-of-life vehicles, and a manufacturer of finished steel products.\nOur internal organizational and reporting structure includes two operating and reportable segments: the Auto and Metals Recycling ( AMR\u201d) business and the Cascade Steel and Scrap ( CSS\u201d) business.\nWe use segment operating income to measure our segment performance. We do not allocate corporate interest income and expense, income taxes, and other income and expense to our reportable segments. Certain expenses related to shared services that support operational activities and transactions are allocated from Corporate to the segments. Unallocated Corporate expense consists primarily of expense for management and certain administrative services that benefit both reportable segments. In addition, we do not allocate certain items to segment operating income because management does not include the information in its measurement of the performance of the operating segments. Such unallocated items include restructuring charges and other exit-related activities, charges (net of recoveries) related to legacy environmental matters, and provisions for certain legal matters. Because of the unallocated income and expense, the operating income of each reportable segment does not reflect the operating income the reportable segment would report as a stand-alone business. The results of discontinued operations are excluded from segment operating income and are presented separately, net of tax, from the results of ongoing operations for all periods presented. See Note 16 - Segment Information in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a discussion of the primary activities of each reportable segment, total assets by reportable segment, operating results from continuing operations by reportable segment, revenues from external customers and concentration of sales to foreign countries.\nOur results of operations depend in large part on the demand and prices for recycled metal in foreign and domestic markets and on the supply of raw materials, including end-of-life vehicles, available to be processed at our facilities. We respond to changes in selling prices for processed metal by seeking to adjust purchase prices for unprocessed scrap metal in order to manage the impact on our operating income. We believe we generally benefit from sustained periods of rising recycled scrap metal selling prices, which allow us to better maintain or increase both operating income and unprocessed scrap metal flow into our facilities. When recycled scrap metal selling prices decline, particularly for a sustained period, our operating margins typically compress.\nOur deep water port facilities on both the East and West Coasts of the U.S. (in Everett, Massachusetts; Providence, Rhode Island; Oakland, California; Tacoma, Washington; and Portland, Oregon) and access to public deep water port facilities (in Kapolei, Hawaii and Salinas, Puerto Rico) allow us to efficiently meet the global demand for recycled ferrous metal by enabling us to ship bulk cargoes to steel manufacturers located in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia, North America, Central America, and South America. Our exports of nonferrous recycled metal are shipped in containers through various public docks to specialty steelmakers, foundries, aluminum sheet and ingot manufacturers, copper refineries and smelters, brass and bronze ingot manufacturers, wire and cable producers, wholesalers, and other recycled metal processors globally. We also transport both ferrous and nonferrous metals by truck, rail and barge in order to transfer scrap metal between our facilities for further processing, to load shipments at our export facilities, and to meet regional domestic demand.\nOur results of operations also depend on the demand and prices for our finished steel products, the manufacture of which uses internally sourced ferrous recycled scrap metal as the primary feedstock, as well as other raw materials. Our steel mill in Oregon sells to industrial customers primarily in North America.\n29 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2019\n SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. \nOur quarterly operating results fluctuate based on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, changes in market conditions for ferrous and nonferrous recycled metal and finished steel products, the supply of scrap metal in our domestic markets, and varying demand for used auto parts from our self-service retail stores. Certain of these factors are influenced, to a degree, by the impact of seasonal changes including severe weather conditions, which can impact the timing of shipments and inhibit construction activity utilizing our products, scrap metal collection at our facilities and production levels in our yards, and retail admissions and parts sales at our auto parts stores. Further, trade actions, including tariffs and any retaliation by affected countries, and licensing and inspection requirements can impact the level of profitability on sales of our products and, in certain cases, impede or restrict our ability to sell to certain export markets or require us to direct our sales to alternative market destinations, which can cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate. For further information regarding the potential impact of changing conditions in global markets including the impact of tariffs, quotas and other trade actions and import restrictions on our business and results of operations, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report.\nStrategic Priorities\nAs we continue to closely monitor economic conditions, we remain focused on the following core strategies and plans to meet our business goals and objectives:\n \u2022 Long-term expansion of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal supply and processing, sales volumes and operating margins; \n \u2022 Technology investments and process improvements to increase the separation and recovery of recycled materials from our shredding process and to expand product optionality; \n \u2022 Productivity and continuous improvement initiatives to ensure the safety of our employees, increase operating efficiency and effectiveness, advance sustainable business practices, improve natural resource stewardship, and reduce operating expense; \n \u2022 Use of our seven deep water ports and ground-based logistics network to directly access customers domestically and internationally to meet demand for our products wherever it is greatest; \n \u2022 Further optimization of our integrated recycling and steel manufacturing operating platforms to maximize opportunities for synergies, cost efficiencies and volumes; and \n \u2022 Increase market share through initiatives to maximize volumes and through selective partnerships, alliances and acquisitions. \nKey economic factors and trends affecting the industries in which we operate\nWe sell recycled metals to the global steel industry for the production of finished steel. Our financial results largely depend on supply of raw materials in the U.S. and Western Canada and demand for recycled metal in foreign and domestic markets and for finished steel products in the Western U.S. Demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions. The timing and magnitude of the economic cycles in the industries in which our products are used, including global steel manufacturing and nonresidential and infrastructure construction in the U.S., are difficult to predict. Global economic conditions, changes in supply and demand conditions, the strength of the U.S. dollar, the availability and price of raw material alternatives, and trade actions such as tariffs affect market prices for and sales volumes of recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal in global markets and steel products in the Western U.S. and can have a significant impact on the results of operations for our reportable segments.\nBeginning in the second half of fiscal 2016 through fiscal 2018, the combination of improved U.S. and global economic growth, lower Chinese steel exports, and increased use of EAFs by steel manufacturers in other export markets contributed to improved demand and prices for ferrous recycled scrap metal, positively impacting our operating results. In fiscal 2018, selling prices for ferrous recycled metal rose during the first three quarters followed by a modest decrease in the fourth quarter. The higher price environment for scrap metal during fiscal 2018 together with benefits from increased sales diversification, commercial initiatives to improve supply channels and a strong U.S. economy led to an increase in scrap supply flows into our facilities, including end-of-life vehicles, resulting in higher processed volumes compared to recent prior years. The higher average selling prices supported an expansion of the spread between direct purchase costs and selling prices of ferrous recycled metal compared to the prior year. Our operating margins also benefited from improved volumes of nonferrous material from end-of-life vehicles and the shredding process, partially offset by operating margin compression experienced near the end of fiscal 2018 as a result of a decrease in average net selling prices for certain nonferrous products driven primarily by the global impact of new regulations and measures put into place by China during the year, including import regulations and tariffs on U.S. scrap imports.\n30 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2019\n SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. \nIn fiscal 2018, our CSS business benefited from reduced price pressure from steel imports, the impact of U.S. tariffs on steel imports, and steady demand for finished steel products in the West Coast markets which contributed to higher selling prices for our finished steel products. CSS experienced improved metal margins in fiscal 2018 from selling prices increasing faster than raw material purchase prices which, in combination with operational synergies gained following the integration of our steel manufacturing and Oregon metals recycling operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, led to significantly improved results compared to the prior year.\nIn fiscal 2019, weaker market conditions for recycled metals, primarily due to slower global economic growth and the effects of tariffs and other regulatory measures, resulted in lower average net selling prices for our ferrous and nonferrous recycled metal products and lower ferrous export sales volumes compared to fiscal 2018. Operating results at AMR in fiscal 2019 decreased significantly compared to fiscal 2018 as a result of operating margin compression from the decline in average net selling prices for our recycled metal products which outpaced the reduction in purchase costs for raw materials. Average net selling prices for ferrous recycled metal have trended downwards since the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Domestic ferrous sales volumes in fiscal 2019 increased compared to the prior year, reflecting strong demand in the U.S. market particularly during the first half of fiscal 2019, partially offsetting the adverse impact of the weaker ferrous export market conditions and lower average net selling prices. Nonferrous average net selling prices in fiscal 2019 decreased significantly compared to fiscal 2018 primarily reflecting reduced demand for nonferrous products globally, as well as the continued impact of Chinese import restrictions and tariffs on certain nonferrous products put into place starting in the second half of fiscal 2018.\nIn fiscal 2019, CSS benefited from reduced pressure from steel imports and higher net selling prices for finished steel products particularly during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, resulting in higher finished steel margins in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior year. However, these benefits were more than offset by lower finished steel and recycled metal sales volumes and increased steelmaking consumables costs compared to fiscal 2018, resulting in lower operating results at CSS year-over-year.\nExecutive Overview of Financial Results\nWe generated consolidated revenues of $2.1 billion in fiscal 2019, a decrease of 10% from the $2.4 billion of consolidated revenues generated in fiscal 2018, primarily reflecting weaker market conditions for recycled metals globally resulting in lower average net selling prices for our ferrous and nonferrous products compared to the prior year. In fiscal 2019, the average net selling prices for ferrous and nonferrous recycled metal at AMR were 9% and 18% lower, respectively, compared to the prior year. Steel revenues in fiscal 2019 were flat compared to the prior year reflecting the impact of higher average net selling prices for our finished steel products offset by lower finished steel sales volumes compared to the prior year.\nConsolidated operating income was $84 million in fiscal 2019, compared to $149 million in fiscal 2018. AMR reported operating income in fiscal 2019 of $96 million, compared to $169 million in the prior year. The decrease in AMR operating results in fiscal 2019 was primarily the result of operating margin compression from the decline in average net selling prices for our ferrous and nonferrous products which outpaced the reduction in purchase costs for raw materials, partially offset by the benefits from productivity initiatives and higher nonferrous sales volumes compared to the prior year. The lower average ferrous selling prices in fiscal 2019 primarily reflected the weaker price environment for recycled metals in our domestic markets and the effects of tariffs and other regulatory measures on demand for recycled metals in our export markets. The lower average nonferrous selling prices in fiscal 2019 primarily resulted from reduced demand for nonferrous products globally, as well as the continued effects of Chinese import restrictions and tariffs on certain nonferrous products put into place starting in the second half of fiscal 2018. The spread between direct purchase costs and selling prices of ferrous recycled metal at AMR in fiscal 2019 contracted by approximately 4% compared to the prior year and average net selling prices for AMR's nonferrous joint products recovered from the shredding process, comprising primarily zorba, decreased by 26% in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior year, contributing significantly to the operating margin compression at AMR in fiscal 2019. CSS reported operating income of $32 million in fiscal 2019, compared to $38 million in the prior year, reflecting lower sales of recycled scrap metal and lower finished steel sales volumes partially offset by higher finished steel margins driven by the effects of the higher price environment, and the benefits from productivity initiatives.\nConsolidated selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expense in fiscal 2019 decreased by $17 million, or 8%, compared to the prior year primarily due to decreased employee-related expenses, including from lower incentive compensation accruals, and decreased environmental-related and legal and professional services expenses.\nIn fiscal 2019, we undertook productivity initiatives aimed at delivering $35 million in annual benefits in order to mitigate the weaker price environment in the ferrous and nonferrous markets. We expect these benefits will be achieved through a combination of production cost efficiencies, reductions in SG&A expense and increases in retail sales. Of the total, approximately 75% of the targeted benefits are in AMR with the remainder split between CSS and Corporate. We achieved over 80% of the total targeted benefits in fiscal 2019 with the full amount expected to be achieved in fiscal 2020. For fiscal 2019, we achieved approximately $30 million in benefits as a result of these initiatives.\n31 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2019\n SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. \nNet income from continuing operations attributable to SSI shareholders in fiscal 2019 was $57 million, or $2.01 per diluted share, compared to $156 million, or $5.46 per diluted share, in the prior year. Adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to SSI shareholders in fiscal 2019 was $61 million, or $2.16 per diluted share, compared to $161 million, or $5.64 per diluted share, in the prior year. Reported and adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to SSI shareholders in fiscal 2018 included discrete income tax benefits totaling $37 million, or $1.30 per diluted share, related to the release of valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets, and an income tax benefit of $7 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, related to the impacts of U.S. federal tax legislation enacted during the year.

Segment Revenues\nRevenues in fiscal 2019 decreased by 12% compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to weaker market conditions for recycled metal globally, resulting in lower average net selling prices for our ferrous and nonferrous products compared to fiscal 2018. Despite the lower price environment, domestic ferrous sales volumes in fiscal 2019 increased by 17% compared to the prior year due to increased U.S. steel mill utilization, partially offsetting the adverse impact of the weaker ferrous export market conditions in the year. Nonferrous revenues in fiscal 2019 decreased by 11% compared to the prior year, as average net selling prices decreased by 18% compared to fiscal 2018, primarily reflecting reduced demand for nonferrous products globally, as well as the continued impact of Chinese import restrictions and tariffs on certain nonferrous products put into place starting in the second half of fiscal 2018.\n34 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2019\n SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. \nAMR Segment Operating Income\nOperating income for fiscal 2019 was $96 million, compared to $169 million in fiscal 2018. The decrease in AMR operating results in fiscal 2019 was primarily the result of operating margin compression from the decline in average net selling prices for our ferrous and nonferrous products which outpaced the reduction in purchase costs for raw materials. The lower average ferrous and nonferrous selling prices in fiscal 2019 reflect the effects of tariffs and other regulatory measures on demand for recycled metals in our export markets, the weaker price environment for recycled metals in our domestic markets, and reduced demand for nonferrous products globally. The spread between direct purchase costs and selling prices of ferrous recycled metal at AMR in fiscal 2019 contracted by approximately 4% compared to the prior year and average net selling prices for AMR's nonferrous joint products recovered from the shredding process, comprising primarily zorba, decreased by 26% in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior year, contributing significantly to the operating margin compression at AMR in fiscal 2019. The adverse effects of lower average net selling prices for recycled metals were partially offset by benefits from productivity initiatives, higher nonferrous sales volumes compared to the prior year, and positive contributions from a limited-duration contract. This contract, which was substantially complete at the end of fiscal 2019, provided a high margin source of supply and benefited AMR operating income by $20 million for fiscal 2019, compared to $23 million for the prior year. AMR SG&A expense in fiscal 2019 decreased by $2 million, or 2%, compared to the prior year primarily due to lower employee-related expenses, including from reduced incentive compensation accruals.\nCascade Steel and Scrap (CSS)\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended August 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Form 10-K 2019\n SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. \nProductivity Initiatives\nIn fiscal 2019, we undertook productivity initiatives aimed at delivering $35 million in annual benefits in order to mitigate the weaker price environment in the ferrous and nonferrous markets. We expect these benefits will be achieved through a combination of production cost efficiencies, reductions in SG&A expense and increases in retail sales. Of the total, approximately 75% of the targeted benefits are in AMR with the remainder split between CSS and Corporate. We achieved over 80% of the total targeted benefits in fiscal 2019 with the full amount expected to be achieved in fiscal 2020. For fiscal 2019, we achieved approximately $30 million in benefits as a result of these initiatives.\nIncome Tax\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended August 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from continuing operations before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 76,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 141,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax (expense) benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (17,670\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,322\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12.4\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed and enacted into law comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Tax Act\u201d), which, except for certain provisions, is effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. The Tax Act's primary change is a reduction in the federal statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, resulting in a pro rata reduction for the Company from 35% to 25.7% for fiscal 2018 and a full reduction to 21% for fiscal 2019. As a change in tax law is accounted for in the period of enactment, we recognized a discrete benefit of $7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 due to the revaluation of U.S. net deferred tax liabilities to reflect the lower statutory rate. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 also reflected application of the Tax Act's lower federal statutory corporate tax rate to fiscal 2018 taxable income. The accounting for the impacts of the Tax Act was complete as of November 30, 2018, and we have not recorded any material adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 related to the Tax Act.\nOur effective tax rate from continuing operations in fiscal 2018 was a benefit of 12.4%. We reported a tax benefit on pre-tax income for fiscal 2018 primarily due to the release of valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets, resulting in recognition of discrete tax benefits totaling $37 million in fiscal 2018, and the impact of the Tax Act. The release of valuation allowances in fiscal 2018 was the result of sufficient positive evidence at the time, including cumulative income in our U.S. and Canadian tax jurisdictions in recent years and projections of future taxable income based primarily on our improved financial performance, that it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.\nWe assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis through an analysis of potential sources of future taxable income, including prior year taxable income available to absorb a carryback of tax losses, reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies, and forecasts of taxable income. We consider all negative and positive evidence, including the weight of the evidence, to determine if valuation allowances against deferred tax assets are required.\nWe continue to maintain valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets related to certain jurisdictions as a result of negative objective evidence, including the effects of historical losses in these tax jurisdictions, outweighing positive objective and subjective evidence, indicating that it is more-likely-than-not that the associated tax benefit will not be realized. Realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the associated tax jurisdictions in future years to benefit from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences and from the utilization of net operating losses. We will continue to regularly assess the realizability of deferred tax assets. Changes in historical earnings performance and future earnings projections, among other factors, may cause us to adjust our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, which would impact our results of operations in the period we determine that these factors have changed.\nSee Note 13 - Income Taxes in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe rely on cash provided by operating activities as a primary source of liquidity, supplemented by current cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facilities.\n36 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2019\n SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. \nSources and Uses of Cash\nWe had cash balances of $12 million and $5 million as of August 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Cash balances are intended to be used primarily for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, investments and acquisitions. We use excess cash on hand to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facilities. As of August 31, 2019, debt was $105 million, compared to $107 million as of August 31, 2018, and debt, net of cash, was $93 million as of August 31, 2019 compared to $103 million as of August 31, 2018 (see the reconciliation of debt, net of cash, in Non-GAAP Financial Measures at the end of this Item 7).\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2019 was $145 million, compared to $160 million in fiscal 2018.\nSources of cash other than from earnings in fiscal 2019 included a $33 million decrease in inventories due to lower raw material purchase prices and timing of payments and sales and a $9 million decrease in accounts receivable due to lower selling prices and the timing of sales and collections. Uses of cash in fiscal 2019 included a $19 million decrease in accrued payroll and related liabilities primarily due to incentive compensation payments made in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and a $17 million decrease in accounts payable primarily due to lower raw material purchase prices and the timing of payments.\nSources of cash other than from earnings in fiscal 2018 included a $26 million increase in accounts payable due to higher raw material purchase prices and timing of payments, and a $11 million combined increase in other accrued liabilities and accrued payroll and related liabilities primarily due to increased incentive compensation liabilities and higher legal accruals. Uses of cash in fiscal 2018 included a $45 million increase in accounts receivable primarily due to increases in recycled metal and finished steel selling prices and sales volumes, as well as the timing of sales and collections, and a $24 million increase in inventories due to higher raw material purchase prices, higher volumes on hand, and the timing of purchases and sales.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2019 was $90 million, compared to $73 million in fiscal 2018.\nCash used in investing activities in fiscal 2019 included capital expenditures of $95 million to upgrade our equipment and infrastructure and for additional investments in nonferrous processing technologies and environmental and safety-related assets, compared to $78 million in the prior year. The significant majority of capital expenditures were associated with projects at AMR.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2019 was $47 million, compared with $88 million in fiscal 2018.\nUses of cash in both fiscal 2019 and 2018 included $21 million for the payment of dividends and $13 million and $17 million, respectively, for share repurchases.

The $700 million credit facility includes a $50 million sublimit for letters of credit, a $25 million sublimit for swingline loans and a $50 million sublimit for multicurrency borrowings. Interest rates on outstanding indebtedness under the credit agreement are based, at our option, on either the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d), or the Canadian equivalent for C$ loans, plus a spread of between 1.25% and 2.75%, with the amount of the spread based on a pricing grid tied to our consolidated funded debt to EBITDA ratio, or the greater of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, or (c) the daily rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 1.75%, in each case plus a spread of between zero and 1.50% based on a pricing grid tied to our consolidated funded debt to EBITDA ratio. In addition, commitment fees are payable on the unused portion of the credit facilities at rates between 0.15% and 0.45% based on a pricing grid tied to our consolidated funded debt to EBITDA ratio.\nWe had borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities of $97 million and $100 million as of August 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on amounts outstanding under our credit facilities was 3.78% and 3.57% as of August 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe use the credit facilities to fund working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, investments and acquisitions. Our credit agreement contains various representations and warranties, events of default and financial and other customary covenants which limit (subject to certain exceptions) our ability to, among other things, incur or suffer to exist certain liens, make investments, incur or guaranty additional indebtedness, enter into consolidations, mergers, acquisitions, and sales of assets, make distributions and other restricted payments, change the nature of our business, engage in transactions with affiliates and enter into restrictive agreements, including agreements that restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions. The financial covenants under the credit agreement include (a) a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, defined as the four-quarter rolling sum of consolidated adjusted EBITDA less defined maintenance capital expenditures and certain environmental expenditures divided by consolidated fixed charges and (b) a consolidated leverage ratio, defined as consolidated funded indebtedness divided by the sum of consolidated net worth and consolidated funded indebtedness.\nAs of August 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the financial covenants under our credit agreement. The consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio was required to be no less than 1.50 to 1.00 and was 3.65 to 1.00 as of August 31, 2019. The consolidated leverage ratio was required to be no more than 0.55 to 1.00 and was 0.14 to 1.00 as of August 31, 2019.\nOur obligations under our credit agreement are guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries. The credit facilities and the related guarantees are secured by senior first priority liens on certain of our and our subsidiaries' assets, including equipment, inventory and accounts receivable.\nWhile we expect to remain in compliance with the financial covenants under our credit agreement, there can be no assurances that we will be able to do so in the event market conditions or other negative factors which adversely impact our results of operations and financial position lead to a trend of consolidated net losses. If we do not maintain compliance with our financial covenants and are unable to obtain an amendment or waiver from our lenders, a breach of a financial covenant would constitute an event of default and allow the lenders to exercise remedies under the agreements, the most severe of which is the termination of the credit facility under our committed bank credit agreement and acceleration of the amounts owed under the agreement. In such case, we would be required to evaluate available alternatives and take appropriate steps to obtain alternative funds. There can be no assurances that any such alternative funds, if sought, could be obtained or, if obtained, would be adequate or on acceptable terms.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures totaled $95 million for fiscal 2019, compared to $78 million for fiscal 2018. Capital expenditures in each of fiscal 2019 and 2018 were primarily to upgrade our equipment, facilities and infrastructure, and for additional investments in nonferrous processing technologies and environmental and safety-related assets. We currently plan to invest up to $125 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2020, including $60 million for investments in growth, including new nonferrous processing technology and to support volume initiatives and other growth projects, using cash generated from operations and available credit facilities.\nEnvironmental Compliance\nBuilding on our commitment to recycling and operating our business in an environmentally responsible manner, we continue to invest in facilities that improve our environmental presence in the communities in which we operate. As part of our capital expenditures discussed in the prior paragraph, we invested $36 million and $20 million for environmental projects in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. We plan to invest in the range of $15 million of our planned capital expenditures for environmental projects in fiscal 2020. These projects include investments in storm water systems and equipment to ensure ongoing compliance with air quality and other environmental regulations.\n38 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2019\n SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. \nWe have been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA\u201d) as one of the potentially responsible parties that own or operate or formerly owned or operated sites which are part of or adjacent to the Portland Harbor Superfund site (the Site\u201d). See Note 8 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a discussion of this matter, as well as other legacy environmental loss contingencies. We believe it is not possible to reasonably estimate the amount or range of costs which we are likely to or which it is reasonably possible that we will incur in connection with the Site, although such costs could be material to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. We have insurance policies that we believe will provide reimbursement for costs we incur for defense, remediation and mitigation for natural resource damages claims in connection with the Site, although there are no assurances that those policies will cover all of the costs which we may incur. Significant cash outflows in the future related to the Site could reduce the amounts available for borrowing that could otherwise be used for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, investments and acquisitions and could result in our failure to maintain compliance with certain covenants in our debt agreements, and could adversely impact our liquidity.\nDividends\nOn August 2, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a dividend for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 of $0.1875 per common share, which equates to an annual cash dividend of $0.75 per common share. Dividends of $0.75 per common share, totaling $21 million, were declared and paid during fiscal 2019.\nShare Repurchase Program\nPursuant to our amended share repurchase program, as of August 31, 2019, we have authorization to repurchase up to a remaining 759 thousand shares of our Class A common stock when we deem such repurchases to be appropriate. We may repurchase our common stock for a variety of reasons, such as to optimize our capital structure and to offset dilution related to share-based compensation arrangements. We consider several factors in determining whether to make share repurchases including, among other factors, our cash needs, the availability of funding, our future business plans and the market price of our stock. As of the beginning of fiscal 2018, we had repurchased approximately 7.2 million shares of our Class A common stock under the program. We repurchased approximately 516 thousand shares for a total of $17 million in open-market transactions in fiscal 2018, and approximately 527 thousand shares for a total of $13 million in open-market transactions in fiscal 2019.\nAssessment of Liquidity and Capital Resources\nHistorically, our available cash resources, internally generated funds, credit facilities and equity offerings have financed our acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other financing needs.\nWe generally believe our current cash resources, internally generated funds, existing credit facilities and access to the capital markets will provide adequate short-term and long-term liquidity needs for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, investments and acquisitions, joint ventures, debt service requirements, environmental obligations and other contingencies. However, in the event of a sustained market deterioration, we may need additional liquidity, which would require us to evaluate available alternatives and take appropriate steps to obtain sufficient additional funds. There can be no assurances that any such supplemental funding, if sought, could be obtained or, if obtained, would be adequate or on acceptable terms.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNone requiring disclosure pursuant to Item 303 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n39 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc.

As contractual interest rates and the amount of debt outstanding is variable in certain cases, actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided. \n (3) Purchase obligations include all enforceable, legally binding agreements to purchase goods or services that specify all significant terms, regardless of the duration of the agreement. \n (4) Other contractual obligations consist of pension funding obligations and other accrued liabilities. \nWe maintain stand-by letters of credit to provide support for certain obligations, including workers' compensation and performance bonds. At August 31, 2019, we had $10 million outstanding under these arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make certain judgments, estimates, and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. We deem critical accounting policies to be those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. We are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.\nOur critical accounting estimates include those related to inventories, long-lived assets, goodwill, environmental costs, revenue recognition, and income taxes.\nInventories\nOur inventories consist of processed and unprocessed scrap metal (ferrous, nonferrous, and mixed nonferrous recovered joint products arising from the manufacturing process), semi-finished steel products (billets), finished steel products (primarily rebar, wire rod, and merchant bar), used and salvaged vehicles, and supplies. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. We consider estimated future selling prices when determining the estimated net realizable value of our inventory. As we generally sell our recycled ferrous metal under contracts that provide for shipment within 30 to 60 days after the price is agreed, we utilize the selling prices under committed contracts and sales orders for determining the estimated net realizable value of quantities on hand that will be shipped under these contracts and sales orders.\n40 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2019\n SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. \nThe accounting process we use to record ferrous scrap metal quantities relies on significant estimates. With respect to estimating the quantities of unprocessed ferrous scrap metal inventory that are moved into production, we rely on weighed quantities of the processed ferrous material, adjusted for estimated metal recoveries and yields that are based on historical trends and other judgments"}
