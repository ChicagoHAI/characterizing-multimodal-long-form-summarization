Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOverview\nWe are a publicly traded master limited partnership with operations in 27 states. We provide integrated terminalling, gathering and transportation services for companies engaged in the production, distribution and marketing of liquid asphalt and crude oil. We manage our operations through four operating segments: (i) asphalt terminalling services, (ii) crude oil terminalling services, (iii) crude oil pipeline services and (iv) crude oil trucking and producer field services.\nPotential Impact of Crude Oil Market Price Changes and Other Factors on Future Revenues\nSince June of 2014, the market price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil has fluctuated significantly from a peak of approximately $108 per barrel to a low of approximately $30 per barrel (as of March 1, 2018, the price per barrel was approximately $63). Furthermore, during the fourth quarter of 2014, the West Texas Intermediate crude oil forward price curve changed from a backwardated curve (in which the current crude oil price per barrel is higher than the future price per barrel and a premium is placed on delivering product to market and selling as soon as possible) to a contango curve (in which future prices are higher than current prices and a premium is placed on storing product and selling at a later time). As of December 31, 2017, the forward price curve is slightly backwardated. In addition to changes in the price of crude oil and changes in the forward pricing curve, there has been significant volatility in the overall energy industry and specifically in publicly traded midstream energy partnerships. As a result there are a number of trends that may impact our partnership in the near term. These include the overall market price for crude oil and whether or not the forward price curve is in contango or backwardated, changes in production and the demand for transportation capacity in the areas in which we serve, and overall changes in our cost of capital. We expect this volatility to have near-term impacts as discussed below.\nAsphalt Terminalling Services - Although there is no direct correlation between the price of crude oil and the price of asphalt, the asphalt industry tends to benefit from a lower crude oil price environment, strong economy and an increase in infrastructure spend. As a result, we do not expect the changes in the price of crude oil to significantly impact our asphalt terminalling services operating segment.\nCrude Oil Terminalling Services - A contango crude oil curve tends to favor the crude oil storage business as crude oil marketers are incentivized to store crude oil during the current month and sell into a future month. As a result of the decrease in the crude oil price and change in the crude oil futures pricing curve, our weighted average storage rates increased from September 2014 to March 2016. Since March of 2016, the crude oil curve has generally been in a shallow contango, meaning the current price of oil is only slightly less than the price in future months. In these shallow contango markets there is no clear incentive for marketers to store barrels. As of December 31, 2017, the forward price curve is slightly backwardated. In addition, a shallow contango or a backwardated market may impact our ability to re-contract expiring contracts and/or decrease the storage rate at which we are able to re-contract.\nCrude Oil Pipeline Services - In late April 2016, as a precautionary measure, we suspended service on a segment of our Mid-Continent pipeline system due to a discovery of a pipeline exposure caused by heavy rains and the erosion of a riverbed in southern Oklahoma. There was no damage to the pipeline and no loss of product. In the second quarter of 2016, we took action to mitigate the service suspension and worked with customers to divert volumes, and, in certain circumstances, transported volumes to a third-party pipeline system via truck. In addition, the term of the throughput and deficiency agreement on our Eagle North pipeline system expired at June 30, 2016, and, in July of 2016, we completed a connection of the southeastern most portion of our Mid-Continent pipeline system to our Eagle North pipeline system and concurrently reversed the Eagle North pipeline system.\nWe are currently operating one Oklahoma mainline system, which is a combination of both the Mid-Continent and Eagle North pipeline systems instead of two separate systems, providing us with a current capacity of approximately 20,000 to 25,000 Bpd. We are working to restore service of the second Oklahoma pipeline system and expect to put the line back in service by the end of the second quarter of 2018, increasing the transportation capacity of our pipeline systems by approximately 20,000 Bpd. The ability to fully utilize the capacity of these systems may be impacted by the market price of crude oil and producers' decisions to increase or decrease production in the areas we serve.\nWe experienced a decrease in revenue on our East Texas pipeline system as a result of an overall decrease in production in the area and the expiration of an incentive tariff on a section of the system in 2015. As a result of the decrease in revenues and resulting decline in market values, we recognized non-cash impairment expenses of $12.6 million and $1.4 million related to our East Texas pipeline system and a portion of our Mid-Continent pipeline system, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2015 and an additional $2.3 million related to our East Texas pipeline system in the fourth quarter of 2016. On April 18, 2017, we sold the East Texas pipeline system. We received cash proceeds at closing of approximately $4.8 million and recorded a gain of less than $0.1 million.\nThe Knight Warrior project was canceled during the second quarter of 2016 due to continued low rig counts in the Eaglebine/Woodbine area coupled with lower production volumes, competing projects and the overall impact of the decreased market price of crude oil. Consequently, shipper commitments related to the project were cancelled, and an impairment expense of $22.6 million related to the project was recognized in June 2016.\nOn April 3, 2017, Advantage Pipeline, L.L.C. ( Advantage Pipeline\u201d), in which we owned an approximate 30% equity ownership interest, was acquired by a joint venture formed by affiliates of Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. and Noble Midstream Partners LP. We received cash proceeds at closing from the sale of our approximate 30% equity ownership interest in Advantage Pipeline of approximately $25.3 million and recorded a gain on the sale of the investment of $4.2 million. Approximately 10% of the gross sale proceeds were held in escrow, subject to certain post-closing settlement terms and conditions. We received approximately $1.1 million of the funds held in escrow in August 2017 and our remaining balance of $2.2 million in January 2018.\nCrude Oil Trucking and Producer Field Services - A backwardated crude oil curve tends to favor the crude oil transportation services business as crude oil marketers are incentivized to deliver crude oil to market and sell as soon as possible. When the crude oil market curve changed from a backwardated curve to a contango curve in the fourth quarter of 2014, coupled with a decrease in the absolute price of crude oil, transported volumes started decreasing. Throughout 2015, we experienced downward rate pressure in our trucking and producer field services business as producers and marketers attempted to renegotiate service rates to preserve their operating margins in the changing market. In addition, during the second half of 2015, our West Texas operating margins and transported volumes were negatively impacted by increased competition from transporters moving equipment from crude oil shale areas to West Texas, where crude oil volumes have remained relatively consistent, and by producers and marketers quickly pipe-connecting transported barrels. As a result, we decided to cease trucking barrels in West Texas in the fourth quarter of 2015 and refocus our efforts on transporting barrels around our owned crude oil pipelines and storage assets in Oklahoma and Kansas. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a restructuring charge of $1.6 million associated with our exit from West Texas in addition to a non-cash impairment expense of $0.5 million associated with a write-down of assets to their estimated net realizable value. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional detail regarding this restructuring expense. In addition, in December 2017, we evaluated our producer field services business for impairment and recognized an impairment expense of $2.4 million to record our assets at their estimated fair value.\nRecent Events\nA time line of certain recent events is set forth below.\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On March 7, 2018, we acquired an asphalt terminalling facility located in Oklahoma from a third party for $22.0 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On December 1, 2017, we consummated a Purchase & Sale Agreement, dated as of November 22, 2017, among us and Ergon Asphalt & Emulsions, Inc. and Ergon Terminaling, Inc., both subsidiaries of Ergon, Inc., relating to the acquisition of an asphalt terminalling facility located in Bainbridge, Georgia, from Ergon Asphalt & Emulsions, Inc. and Ergon Terminaling, Inc. for a total purchase price of $10.2 million, consisting of 1,898,380 common units representing limited partner interests in us.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On May 11, 2017, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement that consists of a $450.0 million revolving loan facility.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On April 18, 2017, we sold the East Texas pipeline system.

Consequently, shipper commitments related to the project were canceled, and an impairment expense of $22.6 million related to the project was recognized in June 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur Revenues\nOur revenues consist of (i) terminalling revenues, (ii) gathering, transportation and producer field services revenues, (iii) product sales revenues, and (iv) fuel surcharge revenues. On October 5, 2016, Ergon acquired 100% of the outstanding voting stock of our General Partner from Vitol and Charlesbank. Beginning on October 5, 2016, revenue from services provided to Ergon is presented as related-party revenue and revenue from services provided to Vitol is presented as a third-party revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we derived approximately $56.7 million of our revenues from services we provided to related parties, with $56.4 million and $0.3 million attributable to Ergon and Advantage Pipeline, respectively.\nTerminalling revenues consist of (i) storage service fees resulting from short-term and long-term contracts for committed space that may or may not be utilized by the customer in a given month; and (ii) terminal throughput service charges to pump crude oil to connecting carriers or to deliver asphalt product out of our terminals. Terminal throughput service charges are\nrecognized as the crude oil or asphalt product is delivered out of our terminal. Storage service revenues are recognized as the services are provided on a monthly basis. We earn terminalling revenues in two of our segments: (i) crude oil terminalling services and (ii) asphalt terminalling services.\nAs of March 1, 2018, we have approximately 5.4 million barrels of crude oil storage under service contracts, including 4.7 million barrels of crude oil storage contracts that are either month-to-month contracts or expire in 2018. The weighted average remaining term on the service contracts is approximately 11 months, with one contract having a remaining term of 47 months. Storage contracts with Vitol represent 2.2 million barrels of crude oil storage capacity under contract.\nAs of March 7, 2018, we have leases and terminalling agreements for all of our 56 asphalt facilities, including 26 facilities under contract with Ergon. Lease and terminalling agreements related to 16 of these facilities have terms that expire by the end of 2018, while the agreements relating to our additional 40 facilities have on average five years remaining under their terms. We operate the asphalt facilities pursuant to terminalling agreements while our contract counterparties operate the asphalt facilities that are subject to lease agreements.\nGathering and transportation services revenues consist of service fees recognized for the gathering of crude oil for our customers and the transportation of crude oil to refiners, to common carrier pipelines for ultimate delivery to refiners or to terminalling facilities owned by us and others. Revenue for the gathering and transportation of crude oil is recognized when the service is performed and is based upon regulated and non-regulated tariff rates and the related transport volumes. Producer field services revenue consists of a number of services ranging from gathering condensates from natural gas producers to hauling produced water to disposal wells. Revenue for producer field services is recognized when the service is performed. We earn gathering and transportation revenues in two of our segments: (i) crude oil pipeline services and (ii) crude oil trucking and producer field services.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we transported approximately 23,000 Bpd on our pipelines, a decrease of 36% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in volumes is primarily attributable to suspended service on our Mid-Continent pipeline system due to a discovery of a pipeline exposure in April 2016. We are working to\nrestore service of the second Oklahoma pipeline system and expect to put the line back in service by the end of the second quarter of 2018, increasing the transportation capacity of our pipeline systems by approximately 20,000 Bpd. See Crude oil pipeline services within our results of operations discussion for additional detail. Vitol accounted for 57% and 33% of volumes transported in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we transported approximately 21,000 Bpd on our crude transport trucks, a decrease of 22% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. As noted above, we are working to restore service of the second Oklahoma pipeline system and expect to put the line back in service by the end of the second quarter of 2018. When our second Oklahoma pipeline system resumes service, we anticipate an increase in volumes transported by our crude oil transport trucks as we gather barrels to be transported on this pipeline. See Crude oil trucking and producer field services within our results of operations discussion for additional detail. Vitol accounted for approximately 43% and 30% of volumes transported in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nProduct sales revenues are comprised of (i) revenues recognized for the sale of crude oil to our customers that we purchase\nat production leases and (ii) revenue recognized in buy/sell transactions with our customers. Product sales revenue is\nrecognized for products upon delivery and when the customer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. We earn product\nsales revenue in our crude oil pipeline services operating segment.\nFuel surcharge revenues are comprised of revenues recognized for the reimbursement of fuel and power consumed to operate our asphalt terminals. We recognize fuel surcharge revenues in the period in which the related fuel and power expenses are incurred.\nOur Expenses\nOperating expenses increased by 11% in 2017 as compared to 2016. This increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of the nine asphalt terminals from Ergon in October 2016. General and administrative expenses decreased by 15% in 2017 as compared to 2016. This decrease is primarily attributable to expenses incurred in 2016 related to the Ergon Transactions. Our interest expense increased by $1.5 million in 2017 as compared to 2016. See Interest expense within our results of operations discussion for additional detail regarding the factors that contributed to the increase in interest expense in 2017.\nIncome Taxes\nAs part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate the federal and state income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which our subsidiary that is taxed as a corporation operates. This process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. We must then assess, using all available positive and negative evidence, the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. If we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase or decrease this allowance in a period, we must include an expense or reduction of expense within the tax provisions in the consolidated statements of operations.\nUnder ASC 740 - Accounting for Income Taxes, an enterprise must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence. The weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists (a) the more positive evidence is necessary and (b) the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion, or all of the deferred tax asset. Among the more significant types of evidence that we consider are:\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>taxable income projections in future years;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>whether the carryforward period is so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefits;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>future revenue and operating cost projections that will produce more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset based on existing service rates and cost structures; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the future deductible amount coupled with evidence indicating that the loss is an aberration rather than a continuing condition.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased on the consideration of the above factors for our subsidiary that is taxed as a corporation for purposes of determining the likelihood of realizing the benefits of the deferred tax assets, we have provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2017.\nOur Assets and Services\nOur network of assets provides our customers the flexibility to access multiple points for the receipt and delivery of crude oil and the terminalling of liquid asphalt and crude oil. Our operations have minimal direct exposure to changes in liquid asphalt and crude oil prices, but the volumes of liquid asphalt and crude oil we terminal, gather or transport are affected by commodity prices. We generate revenues by charging a fee for services provided at each transportation stage as crude oil is shipped from its origin at the wellhead to destination points such as the Cushing Interchange, to refineries in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas or to pipelines and by charging a fee for services provided for the terminalling of liquid asphalt and crude oil.\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Asphalt Terminalling Services. Our 56 asphalt terminals are located in 26 states and are well-positioned to provide asphalt terminalling services in the market areas they serve throughout the continental United States. With our approximately 10.3 million barrels of total liquid asphalt storage capacity, we are able to provide our customers the ability to effectively manage their liquid asphalt inventories while allowing significant flexibility in their processing and marketing activities. We currently have terminalling contracts or leases with customers for all of our 56 asphalt facilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Crude oil terminalling assets and services.

We currently own and operate approximately 6.6 million barrels of storage capacity at our terminal in Cushing, Oklahoma. Our Cushing terminal is strategically located within the Cushing Interchange, one of the largest crude oil marketing hubs in the United States and the designated point of delivery specified in all NYMEX crude oil futures contracts. Our terminal has the capacity to receive or deliver approximately 10.0 million barrels of crude oil per month. We also own approximately 50 acres of additional land within the Cushing Interchange where we can develop additional storage capacity.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Crude oil pipeline assets and services.

In addition to our pipelines, we use our approximately 65 owned or leased tanker trucks to gather crude oil in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas for our customers at remote wellhead locations generally not connected to pipeline and gathering systems and transport the crude oil to aggregation points and storage facilities located along pipeline gathering and transportation systems. In connection with our gathering services, we also provide a number of producer field services, ranging from gathering condensates from natural gas producers to hauling production waste water to disposal wells. Our producer service fleet consists of approximately 85 trucks in a number of different sizes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFactors That Will Significantly Affect Our Results\nCommodity Prices. Although our current operations have minimal direct exposure to commodity prices, the volumes of liquid asphalt and crude oil we terminal, gather or transport are affected by commodity prices. Petroleum product prices may be contango (future prices higher than current prices) or backwardated (future prices lower than current prices) depending on market expectations for future supply and demand. Our terminalling services benefit most from an increasing price environment, when a premium is placed on storage, and our gathering and transportation services benefit most from a declining price environment, when a premium is placed on prompt delivery.\nVolumes. Our results of operations are dependent upon the volumes of liquid asphalt we terminal and crude oil we terminal, gather and transport. An increase or decrease in the production of crude oil from the oil fields served by our pipelines or an increase or decrease in the demand for crude oil in the areas served by our pipelines and terminal facilities will have a corresponding effect on the volumes we terminal, gather or transport. The production and demand for liquid asphalt and crude oil are driven by many factors, including the price of crude oil.\nAcquisition Activities. We may pursue acquisition opportunities. These acquisition efforts may involve assets that, if acquired, would have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We can give no assurance that any such acquisition efforts will be successful or that any such acquisition will be completed on terms ultimately favorable to us.\nOrganic Expansion Activities. We may pursue opportunities to expand our existing asset base and consider constructing additional assets in strategic locations. The construction of additions or modifications to our existing assets and the construction of new assets involve numerous regulatory, environmental, political, legal and operational uncertainties beyond our control and may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital.\nDistributions to our Unitholders. We may make distributions to holders of our Preferred Units and common units as well as to our General Partner. To the extent that substantially all of our cash generated by our operations is used to make such distributions, we expect that we will rely upon external financing sources, including commercial bank borrowings and other debt and equity issuances, to fund our acquisition and expansion capital expenditures, as well as our working capital needs.\nVitol Storage Agreements\nIn recent years, a significant portion of our crude oil storage capacity has been dedicated to Vitol under multiple agreements. As of December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, 2.2 million barrels of storage capacity were dedicated to Vitol under these storage agreements. Service revenues under these agreements are based on the barrels of storage dedicated to Vitol under the applicable agreement at rates that, we believe, are fair and reasonable to us and our unitholders and are comparable with the rates we charge third parties. The Board's conflicts committee reviewed and approved these agreements in accordance with our procedures for approval of related-party transactions and the provisions of the partnership agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated revenues under these agreements of approximately $9.4 million, all of which is classified as related-party revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated revenues under these agreements of approximately $9.6 million, of which $2.1 million was classified as third-party revenue. All revenue for 2017 is classified as third-party revenue.\nAs of March 1, 2018, 2.2 million barrels of storage capacity were dedicated to Vitol under the crude oil storage agreement with the current term scheduled to expire on April 30, 2018. We are in the process of renegotiating this contract, however, we may not be able to extend, renegotiate or replace this contract when it expires and the terms of any renegotiated contracts may not be as favorable as the contracts they replace.\nErgon Agreements\nTwenty-six of our asphalt terminals are contracted to Ergon under multiple agreements. Service revenues under these agreements are primarily based on contracted monthly fees under the applicable agreement at rates, which we believe are fair and reasonable to us and our unitholders and are comparable with the rates we charge third parties. As of March 7, 2018, leases and storage agreements related to 15 of these facilities are scheduled to expire by the end of 2018. We may not be able to extend, renegotiate or replace these contracts when they expire and the terms of any renegotiated contracts may not be as favorable as the contracts they replace. The Board's conflicts committee reviewed and approved these agreements in accordance with our procedures for approval of related-party transactions and the provisions of the partnership agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized revenues of $15.5 million for services provided to Ergon under these agreements, all of which is classified as third-party revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized revenues of $22.1 million for services provided to Ergon under these agreements, of which $10.9 million is classified as related-party revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized revenues of $56.3 million for services provided to Ergon under these agreements, all of which is classified as related-party revenue.\nResults of Operations\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, management uses additional measures that are known as non-GAAP financial measures\u201d in its evaluation of past performance and prospects for the future. The primary measure used by management is operating margin excluding depreciation and amortization.\nManagement believes that the presentation of such additional financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our performance and results of operations because these measures, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, (i) provide additional information about our core operating performance and ability to generate and distribute cash flow; (ii) provide investors with the financial analytical framework upon which management bases financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions; and (iii) present measurements that investors, rating agencies and debt holders have indicated are useful in assessing us and our results of operations. These additional financial measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable measures as reported in accordance with GAAP, and should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, our consolidated financial statements and footnotes.\nThe table below summarizes our financial results for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP

3% from 2016 to 2017. Asphalt terminalling services operating margin increased $7.9 million or 14% from 2016 to 2017 as a result of the acquisition of eleven asphalt terminals in 2016, increased product throughput volumes and renegotiated throughput fees for some of our asphalt facilities. This increase was partially offset by decreases in our other operating segments. The decrease in our crude oil terminalling services operating margin was primarily due to decreased throughput fees as lower volumes were transferred in and out of our facilities, coupled with lower re-contracted storage rates as prior contracts expired throughout the year. The crude oil pipeline services operating margin decreased primarily due to a decrease in volume transported by our pipelines related to suspended service on our Mid-Continent pipeline system beginning in April 2016 after a discovery of a pipeline exposure caused by heavy rains and erosion of a river in southern Oklahoma, as well as the sale of our East Texas pipeline system in April 2017.\nTotal operating margin excluding depreciation and amortization increased 9% from 2015 to 2016. Asphalt terminalling services operating margin increased $8.6 million or 18% from 2015 to 2016 as a result of the acquisition of eleven asphalt terminals in 2016, increased product throughput volumes and renegotiated throughput fees for some of our asphalt facilities.

We recorded a restructuring expense of $1.6 million related to employee severance and idle equipment costs related to our exit from the West Texas trucking business in 2015. This restructuring led to the improvement in operating margin from 2015 to 2016 despite decreased volumes and rates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Income and Expenses\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased to $31.1 million for 2017 compared to $30.8 million for 2016 and $27.2 million for 2015. These increases are primarily the result of pipeline and asphalt facility acquisitions made during the past two years.\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense was $17.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $20.0 million for 2016 and $19.0 million for 2015. The increase in expense for 2016 over 2017 and 2015 is primarily related to $1.8 million of transaction fees related to the Ergon Change of Control and acquisition-related expenses.\nAsset impairment expense. During 2017, we recorded fixed asset and intangible asset impairment expense, including an impairment of goodwill, of $2.4 million related to a write-down of our producer field services business to estimated fair value. During 2016, we recorded fixed asset impairment expense of $25.8 million, primarily due to an impairment recognized on the Knight Warrior pipeline project and the East Texas pipeline system. The Knight Warrior pipeline project was canceled due to continued low rig counts in the Eaglebine/Woodbine area coupled with lower production volumes, competing projects and the overall impact of the decreased market price of crude oil. Consequently, shipper commitments related to the project were canceled. During 2015, we recorded fixed asset impairment expenses of $12.6 million, $1.4 million, and $0.5 million related to the write-down of our East Texas pipeline system, a portion of our Mid-Continent pipeline system and our West Texas trucking stations, respectively, to their estimated fair value. In 2015, we also recorded an impairment expense of $7.5 million related to goodwill associated with our pipeline services reporting unit. We used a discounted cash flow model, supplemented by a market approach, to evaluate goodwill and the estimated fair value of assets. Key assumptions in the analysis include the use of an appropriate discount rate, volume and rate forecasts and estimates of operating costs. Due to the imprecise nature of our projections and assumptions, actual results can and often do differ from our estimates. If the assumptions used in our projections and analysis prove to be inaccurate or if the markets in which we operate experience future adverse conditions, we could incur additional impairment charges in the future.\nGain (loss) on sale of assets. Loss on sale of assets was $1.0 million in 2017 compared to gains of $0.1 million and $6.1 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. Losses for 2017 include $0.4 million related to the disposal of an asphalt tank floor that had to be replaced due to corrosion. Additional losses in 2017 were the result of sales and disposals of surplus, used property and equipment. The gain on sale of assets in 2016 consists of the sale of surplus, used property and equipment. The gain on sale of assets in 2015 includes a $6.0 million gain on the sale of crude oil pipeline linefill and storage tank bottoms related to the settlement of litigation with SemCorp in September 2015.\nEquity earnings in unconsolidated affiliate. The equity earnings are attributable to our former investment in Advantage Pipeline. On April 3, 2017, we sold our investment in Advantage Pipeline and received cash proceeds at closing from the sale of approximately $25.3 million, recognizing a gain on sale of unconsolidated affiliate of $4.2 million. Approximately 10% of the gross sale proceeds were held in escrow, subject to certain post-closing settlement terms and conditions. We received approximately $1.1 million of the funds held in escrow in August 2017, for which we recognized an additional gain on sale of unconsolidated affiliate during the three months ended September 30, 2017. We received approximately $2.2 million for the pro rata portion of the remaining net escrow proceeds in January 2018.\nInterest expense. Interest expense was $14.0 million for 2017 compared to $12.6 million and $11.2 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. Interest expense represents interest on borrowings under our credit agreement, as well as amortization of debt issuance costs and unrealized gains and losses related to the change in fair value of interest rate swaps.\nThe increase in interest expense from 2016 to 2017 was primarily the result of increases in the weighted average interest rate and in the weighted average debt outstanding during the period. During 2016 and 2017, the weighted average interest rate under the credit agreement was 3.95% and 4.43%, respectively. In addition, we wrote off $0.7 million of debt issuance costs during 2017 due to the amendment of our credit agreement. These increases were partially offset by decreases in interest expense related to our interest rate swap agreements of $1.8 million.\nThe increase in interest expense from 2015 to 2016 was primarily the result of increases in the weighted average interest rate and in the weighted average debt outstanding during the periods. During 2015 and 2016, the weighted average interest rate under the credit agreement was 3.37% and 3.95%, respectively. In addition, the interest expense resulting from the amortization of debt issuance costs increased by $0.2 million in 2016. These increases were partially offset by decreases in interest expense related to our interest rate swap agreements of $2.1 million.\nEffects of Inflation\nIn recent years, inflation has been modest and has not had a material impact upon the results of our operations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by Item 303 of Regulation S-K.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows and Capital Expenditures\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017:\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>(44.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(159.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>(15.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(72.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $54.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $52.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily the result of changes in working capital.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $52.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $60.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities is primarily the result of changes in working capital and lower net income.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash provided by investing activities was $17.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $159.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2017, included maintenance capital expenditures of $7.9 million, net of reimbursable\nexpenditures of $0.8 million, and expansion capital expenditures of $9.4 million, net of reimbursable expenditures of $0.6 million. These expenditures were offset by proceeds from the sale of our investment in Advantage Pipeline, the East Texas pipeline system and other assets of $26.5 million, $4.8 million and $4.5 million, respectively.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $159.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $44.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2016, included acquiring nine asphalt terminal facilities from Ergon for $122.6 million, maintenance capital expenditures of $8.7 million, net of reimbursable expenditures of $1.9 million, expansion capital expenditures of $9.4 million and other acquisitions of $19.0 million. These expenditures were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets of $2.0 million. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2015, included maintenance capital expenditures of $7.9 million, net of reimbursable expenditures of $0.5 million, expansion capital expenditures of $33.2 million, primarily related to the Knight Warrior pipeline project, and acquisitions of $21.0 million. These expenditures were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets of $14.7 million as well as $2.3 million related to proceeds from the sale of investments in 2015.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $72.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017, included net payments under our credit agreement of $16.4 million and distributions to unitholders of $49.2 million. In addition, we received proceeds from equity issuances of $0.2 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $107.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016, included net borrowings under our credit agreement of $79.0 million and distributions to unitholders of $47.2 million. In addition, we received proceeds from equity issuances of $26.3 million and repurchased $95.3 million of Preferred Units.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $15.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015, consisted primarily of net borrowings under our credit agreement of $29.0 million and distributions to unitholders of $41.6 million.\nOur Liquidity and Capital Resources\nCash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement are our primary sources of liquidity. Our ability to borrow funds under our credit agreement may be limited by financial covenants. At December 31, 2017, we had a working capital deficit of $0.1 million. This is primarily a function of our approach to cash management. At December 31, 2017, we had approximately $140.9 million of availability under our revolving loan facility, and we could borrow up to $317.0 million, or an additional $7.9 million, and still remain within our covenant restrictions. As of March 1, 2018, we have aggregate unused commitments under our revolving loan facility of approximately $139.9 million and cash on hand of approximately $1.3 million.\nCapital Requirements. Our capital requirements consist of the following:\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>maintenance capital expenditures, which are capital expenditures made to maintain the existing integrity and operating capacity of our assets and related cash flows further extending the useful lives of the assets; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>expansion capital expenditures, which are capital expenditures made to expand or to replace partially or fully depreciated assets or to expand the operating capacity or revenue of existing or new assets, whether through construction, acquisition or modification.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nExpansion capital expenditures for organic growth projects totaled $10.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $9.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. These capital expenditures were funded by cash flows from operations, borrowings under our credit agreement and proceeds from the issuance of common units. We currently expect our expansion capital expenditures for organic growth projects to be approximately $10.0 million to $12.0 million, net of reimbursable expenditures, in 2018. Maintenance capital expenditures totaled $7.9 million, net of reimbursable expenditures of $0.8 million, in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $8.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. We currently expect maintenance capital expenditures to be approximately $8.0 million to $10 million, net of reimbursable expenditures, in 2018. Our sources of liquidity for these expansion and maintenance capital expenditures in 2018 are expected to be a combination of cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement.\nOur Ability to Grow Depends on Our Ability to Access External Expansion Capital. Our partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash to our unitholders. Available cash is reduced by cash reserves established by our\nGeneral Partner to provide for the proper conduct of our business (including for future capital expenditures) and to comply with the provisions of our credit agreement. We may not grow as quickly as businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations because we distribute all of our available cash.\nDescription of Credit Agreement. On May 11, 2017, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement which consists of a $450.0 million revolving loan facility.\nOur credit agreement is guaranteed by all of our existing subsidiaries. Obligations under our credit agreement are secured by first priority liens on substantially all of our assets and those of the guarantors.\nOur credit agreement includes procedures for adding financial institutions as revolving lenders or for increasing the revolving commitment of any currently committed revolving lender, subject to the consent of the new or increasing lenders and an aggregate maximum of $600.0 million for all revolving loan commitments under our credit agreement.\nThe credit agreement will mature on May 11, 2022, and all amounts outstanding under our credit agreement shall become due and payable on such date. The credit agreement requires mandatory prepayments of amounts outstanding thereunder with the net proceeds from certain asset sales, property or casualty insurance claims and condemnation proceedings, unless we reinvest such proceeds in accordance with the credit agreement, but these mandatory prepayments will not require any reduction of the lenders' commitments under the credit agreement.\nBorrowings under our credit agreement bear interest, at our option, at either the reserve-adjusted eurodollar rate (as defined in the credit agreement) plus an applicable margin which ranges from 2.0% to 3.0% or the alternate base rate (the highest of the agent bank's prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5%, and the 30-day eurodollar rate plus 1.0%) plus an applicable margin which ranges from 1.0% to 2.0%.\nWe pay a per annum fee on all letters of credit issued under the credit agreement, which fee equals the applicable margin for loans accruing interest based on the eurodollar rate, and we pay a commitment fee on the unused commitments under the credit agreement. The applicable margins for the interest rate, the letters of credit fee and the commitment fee vary quarterly based on our consolidated total leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement, being generally computed as the ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and certain other non-cash charges).\nThe credit agreement includes financial covenants which are tested on a quarterly basis, based on the rolling four-quarter period that ends on the last day of each fiscal quarter.\nPrior to the date on which we issue qualified senior notes in an aggregate principal amount (when combined with all other qualified senior notes previously or concurrently issued) that equals or exceeds $200.0 million, the maximum permitted consolidated total leverage ratio is 4.75 to 1.00; provided that the maximum permitted consolidated total leverage ratio will be 5.25 to 1.00 for certain quarters based on the occurrence of a specified acquisition (as defined in the Partnership's credit agreement, but generally being an acquisition for which the aggregate consideration is $15.0 million or more). The acquisition of the nine asphalt terminals from Ergon in 2016 qualified as a specified acquisition.\nFrom and after the date on which we issue qualified senior notes in an aggregate principal amount (when combined with all other qualified senior notes previously or concurrently issued) that equals or exceeds $200.0 million, the maximum permitted consolidated total leverage ratio is 5.00 to 1.00; provided that from and after the fiscal quarter ending immediately preceding the fiscal quarter in which a specified acquisition occurs to and including the last day of the second full fiscal quarter following the fiscal quarter in which such acquisition occurred, the maximum permitted consolidated total leverage ratio is 5.50 to 1.00.\nThe maximum permitted consolidated senior secured leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement, but generally computed as the ratio of consolidated total secured debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and certain other non-cash charges) is 3.50 to 1.00, but this covenant is only tested from and after the date on which we issue qualified senior notes in an aggregate principal amount (when combined with all other qualified senior notes previously or concurrently issued) that equals or exceeds $200.0 million.\nThe minimum permitted consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement, but generally computed as the ratio of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and certain other non-cash charges to consolidated interest expense) is 2.50 to 1.00.\nIn addition, the credit agreement contains various covenants that, among other restrictions, limit our ability to:\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>create, issue, incur or assume indebtedness;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>create, incur or assume liens;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>engage in mergers or acquisitions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>sell, transfer, assign or convey assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>repurchase our equity, make distributions to unitholders and make certain other restricted payments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>make investments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>modify the terms of certain indebtedness, or prepay certain indebtedness;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>engage in transactions with affiliates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>enter into certain hedging contracts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>enter into certain burdensome agreements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>change the nature of our business; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>make certain amendments to our partnership agreement.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2017, our consolidated total leverage ratio was 4.63 to 1.00 and our consolidated interest coverage ratio was 4.76 to 1.00. We were in compliance with all covenants of our credit agreement as of December 31, 2017.\nThe credit agreement permits us to make quarterly distributions of available cash (as defined in our partnership agreement) to unitholders so long as no default or event of default exists under the credit agreement on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such distribution. We are currently allowed to make distributions to our unitholders in accordance with this covenant; however, we will only make distributions to the extent we have sufficient cash from operations after establishment of cash reserves as determined by the General Partner in accordance with our cash distribution policy, including the establishment of any reserves for the proper conduct of our business.\nIn addition to other customary events of default, the credit agreement includes an event of default if:\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(i)\n</td> <td>our General Partner ceases to own 100% of our general partner interest or ceases to control us;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(ii)\n</td> <td>Ergon ceases to own and control 50.0% or more of the membership interests of our General Partner; or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(iii)\n</td> <td>during any period of 12 consecutive months, a majority of the members of the Board of our General Partner ceases to be composed of individuals:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(A)\n</td> <td>who were members of the Board on the first day of such period;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(B)\n</td> <td>whose election or nomination to the Board was approved by individuals referred to in clause (A) above constituting at the time of such election or nomination at least a majority of the Board; or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(C)\n</td> <td>whose election or nomination to the Board was approved by individuals referred to in clauses (A) and (B) above constituting at the time of such election or nomination at least a majority of the Board,\n</td> </tr>\n</table> provided that any changes to the composition of individuals serving as members of the Board approved by Ergon will not cause an event of default.\nIf an event of default relating to bankruptcy or other insolvency events occurs with respect to our General Partner or us, all indebtedness under our credit agreement will immediately become due and payable. If any other event of default exists under our credit agreement, the lenders may accelerate the maturity of the obligations outstanding under our credit agreement and exercise other rights and remedies. In addition, if any event of default exists under our credit agreement, the lenders may commence foreclosure or other actions against the collateral.\nIf any default occurs under our credit agreement, or if we are unable to make any of the representations and warranties in our credit agreement, we will be unable to borrow funds or have letters of credit issued under our credit agreement.\nContractual Obligations.

We prepared these consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As such, we are required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. We based our estimates on historical experience, available information and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates; however, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The accounting policies that we believe require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and are the most critical to our reporting of results of operations and financial position are as follows:\nUse of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosure of contingencies. Management makes significant estimates including: (1) allowance for doubtful accounts receivable; (2) estimated useful lives of assets, which impacts depreciation; (3) estimated cash flows and fair values inherent in impairment tests; (4) accruals related to revenues and expenses; (5) the estimated fair value of financial instruments; and (6) liability and contingency accruals. Although management believes these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment. Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs that do not add capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are expensed as incurred. The carrying value of the assets is based on estimates, assumptions and judgments relative to useful lives and salvage values. As assets are disposed of or sold, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is included in operating income in the consolidated statements of operations.\nWe calculate depreciation using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of our assets. These estimates are based on various factors, including age (in the case of acquired assets), manufacturing specifications, technological advances and historical data concerning useful lives of similar assets. Uncertainties that impact these estimates include changes in laws and regulations relating to restoration and abandonment requirements, economic conditions and supply and demand in the area. When assets are put into service, we make estimates with respect to useful lives and salvage values that we believe to be reasonable. However, subsequent events could cause us to change our estimates, thus impacting the future calculation of depreciation and amortization. The estimated useful lives of our asset groups are as follows:\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset Group\n</td> <td>Estimated Useful Lives\n(Years)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Land improvements\n</td> <td>10-20\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pipelines and facilities\n</td> <td>5-30\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Storage and terminal facilities\n</td> <td>10-35\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transportation equipment\n</td> <td>3-10\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office property and equipment and other\n</td> <td>3-30\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe capitalize certain costs directly related to the construction of assets, including interest and engineering costs. Upon disposition or retirement of property, plant and equipment, any gain or loss is included in operating income in the consolidated statements of operations.\nWe have contractual obligations to perform dismantlement and removal activities in the event that some of our assets are abandoned. These obligations include varying levels of activity, including completely removing the assets and returning the land to its original state. We have determined that the settlement dates related to the retirement obligations are indeterminate. The assets with indeterminate settlement dates have been in existence for many years and with regular maintenance will continue to be in service for many years to come. In addition, it is not possible to predict when demands for our services will cease, and we do not believe that such demand will cease for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, we believe the date when these assets will be abandoned is indeterminate. With no reasonably determinable abandonment date, we cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the associated asset retirement obligations. We believe that if our asset retirement obligations were settled in the foreseeable future the potential cash flows that would be required to settle the obligations based on current costs are not material. We will record asset retirement obligations for these assets in the period in which sufficient information becomes available for us to reasonably determine the settlement dates.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. Long-lived assets with recorded values that are not expected to be recovered through future cash flows are written down to estimated fair value. Assets are tested for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the carrying value exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss equal to the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset is recognized. Fair value is generally determined from estimated discounted future net cash flows.\nGoodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisitions over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested annually for impairment and when events and circumstances warrant an interim evaluation. Goodwill is tested for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to be impaired. The impairment test is generally based on the estimated discounted future net cash flows of the respective reporting unit, utilizing discount rates and other factors in determining the fair value of the reporting unit. Inputs in the Partnership's estimated discounted future net cash flows include existing and estimated future asset utilization, estimated growth rates in future cash flows and estimated terminal values. During the fourth quarter of 2015, our goodwill impairment test indicated that the fair value of the asphalt services and crude oil trucking and producer field services reporting units exceeded their carrying values and no impairments were indicated. In 2016, an impairment was indicated in the crude oil pipeline services reporting unit and an impairment expense of $7.5 million was recorded. In 2017, an impairment was indicated in the crude oil trucking and field services reporting unit and an impairment expense of $0.9 million was recorded.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information regarding recent accounting developments that may affect our future financial statements, see Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements.", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I am unable to complete your request because I am unable to identify exactly what you are asking for.\n- Could you please provide additional details or clarification regarding your request? \n- I'm not sure how to respond to your request. \n- I'm sorry, but I am unable to complete your request. \n- I'm sorry, but I am unable to complete your request because I do not have the necessary information or capabilities to do so. \n- I'm sorry, but I am unable to complete your request.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOverview\nWe are a publicly traded master limited partnership with operations in 27 states. We provide integrated terminalling, gathering and transportation services for companies engaged in the production, distribution and marketing of liquid asphalt and crude oil. We manage our operations through four operating segments: (i) asphalt terminalling services, (ii) crude oil terminalling services, (iii) crude oil pipeline services and (iv) crude oil trucking and producer field services.\nPotential Impact of Crude Oil Market Price Changes and Other Factors on Future Revenues\nSince June of 2014, the market price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil has fluctuated significantly from a peak of approximately $108 per barrel to a low of approximately $30 per barrel (as of March 1, 2018, the price per barrel was approximately $63). Furthermore, during the fourth quarter of 2014, the West Texas Intermediate crude oil forward price curve changed from a backwardated curve (in which the current crude oil price per barrel is higher than the future price per barrel and a premium is placed on delivering product to market and selling as soon as possible) to a contango curve (in which future prices are higher than current prices and a premium is placed on storing product and selling at a later time). As of December 31, 2017, the forward price curve is slightly backwardated. In addition to changes in the price of crude oil and changes in the forward pricing curve, there has been significant volatility in the overall energy industry and specifically in publicly traded midstream energy partnerships. As a result there are a number of trends that may impact our partnership in the near term. These include the overall market price for crude oil and whether or not the forward price curve is in contango or backwardated, changes in production and the demand for transportation capacity in the areas in which we serve, and overall changes in our cost of capital. We expect this volatility to have near-term impacts as discussed below.\nAsphalt Terminalling Services - Although there is no direct correlation between the price of crude oil and the price of asphalt, the asphalt industry tends to benefit from a lower crude oil price environment, strong economy and an increase in infrastructure spend. As a result, we do not expect the changes in the price of crude oil to significantly impact our asphalt terminalling services operating segment.\nCrude Oil Terminalling Services - A contango crude oil curve tends to favor the crude oil storage business as crude oil marketers are incentivized to store crude oil during the current month and sell into a future month. As a result of the decrease in the crude oil price and change in the crude oil futures pricing curve, our weighted average storage rates increased from September 2014 to March 2016. Since March of 2016, the crude oil curve has generally been in a shallow contango, meaning the current price of oil is only slightly less than the price in future months. In these shallow contango markets there is no clear incentive for marketers to store barrels. As of December 31, 2017, the forward price curve is slightly backwardated. In addition, a shallow contango or a backwardated market may impact our ability to re-contract expiring contracts and/or decrease the storage rate at which we are able to re-contract.\nCrude Oil Pipeline Services - In late April 2016, as a precautionary measure, we suspended service on a segment of our Mid-Continent pipeline system due to a discovery of a pipeline exposure caused by heavy rains and the erosion of a riverbed in southern Oklahoma. There was no damage to the pipeline and no loss of product. In the second quarter of 2016, we took action to mitigate the service suspension and worked with customers to divert volumes, and, in certain circumstances, transported volumes to a third-party pipeline system via truck. In addition, the term of the throughput and deficiency agreement on our Eagle North pipeline system expired at June 30, 2016, and, in July of 2016, we completed a connection of the southeastern most portion of our Mid-Continent pipeline system to our Eagle North pipeline system and concurrently reversed the Eagle North pipeline system.\nWe are currently operating one Oklahoma mainline system, which is a combination of both the Mid-Continent and Eagle North pipeline systems instead of two separate systems, providing us with a current capacity of approximately 20,000 to 25,000 Bpd. We are working to restore service of the second Oklahoma pipeline system and expect to put the line back in service by the end of the second quarter of 2018, increasing the transportation capacity of our pipeline systems by approximately 20,000 Bpd. The ability to fully utilize the capacity of these systems may be impacted by the market price of crude oil and producers' decisions to increase or decrease production in the areas we serve.\nWe experienced a decrease in revenue on our East Texas pipeline system as a result of an overall decrease in production in the area and the expiration of an incentive tariff on a section of the system in 2015. As a result of the decrease in revenues and resulting decline in market values, we recognized non-cash impairment expenses of $12.6 million and $1.4 million related to our East Texas pipeline system and a portion of our Mid-Continent pipeline system, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2015 and an additional $2.3 million related to our East Texas pipeline system in the fourth quarter of 2016. On April 18, 2017, we sold the East Texas pipeline system. We received cash proceeds at closing of approximately $4.8 million and recorded a gain of less than $0.1 million.\nThe Knight Warrior project was canceled during the second quarter of 2016 due to continued low rig counts in the Eaglebine/Woodbine area coupled with lower production volumes, competing projects and the overall impact of the decreased market price of crude oil. Consequently, shipper commitments related to the project were cancelled, and an impairment expense of $22.6 million related to the project was recognized in June 2016.\nOn April 3, 2017, Advantage Pipeline, L.L.C. ( Advantage Pipeline\u201d), in which we owned an approximate 30% equity ownership interest, was acquired by a joint venture formed by affiliates of Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. and Noble Midstream Partners LP. We received cash proceeds at closing from the sale of our approximate 30% equity ownership interest in Advantage Pipeline of approximately $25.3 million and recorded a gain on the sale of the investment of $4.2 million. Approximately 10% of the gross sale proceeds were held in escrow, subject to certain post-closing settlement terms and conditions. We received approximately $1.1 million of the funds held in escrow in August 2017 and our remaining balance of $2.2 million in January 2018.\nCrude Oil Trucking and Producer Field Services - A backwardated crude oil curve tends to favor the crude oil transportation services business as crude oil marketers are incentivized to deliver crude oil to market and sell as soon as possible. When the crude oil market curve changed from a backwardated curve to a contango curve in the fourth quarter of 2014, coupled with a decrease in the absolute price of crude oil, transported volumes started decreasing. Throughout 2015, we experienced downward rate pressure in our trucking and producer field services business as producers and marketers attempted to renegotiate service rates to preserve their operating margins in the changing market. In addition, during the second half of 2015, our West Texas operating margins and transported volumes were negatively impacted by increased competition from transporters moving equipment from crude oil shale areas to West Texas, where crude oil volumes have remained relatively consistent, and by producers and marketers quickly pipe-connecting transported barrels. As a result, we decided to cease trucking barrels in West Texas in the fourth quarter of 2015 and refocus our efforts on transporting barrels around our owned crude oil pipelines and storage assets in Oklahoma and Kansas. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a restructuring charge of $1.6 million associated with our exit from West Texas in addition to a non-cash impairment expense of $0.5 million associated with a write-down of assets to their estimated net realizable value. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional detail regarding this restructuring expense. In addition, in December 2017, we evaluated our producer field services business for impairment and recognized an impairment expense of $2.4 million to record our assets at their estimated fair value.\nRecent Events\nA time line of certain recent events is set forth below.\n \u2022 On March 7, 2018, we acquired an asphalt terminalling facility located in Oklahoma from a third party for $22.0 million. \n \u2022 On December 1, 2017, we consummated a Purchase & Sale Agreement, dated as of November 22, 2017, among us and Ergon Asphalt & Emulsions, Inc. and Ergon Terminaling, Inc., both subsidiaries of Ergon, Inc., relating to the acquisition of an asphalt terminalling facility located in Bainbridge, Georgia, from Ergon Asphalt & Emulsions, Inc. and Ergon Terminaling, Inc. for a total purchase price of $10.2 million, consisting of 1,898,380 common units representing limited partner interests in us. \n \u2022 On May 11, 2017, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement that consists of a $450.0 million revolving loan facility. \n \u2022 On April 18, 2017, we sold the East Texas pipeline system. We received cash proceeds at closing of approximately $4.8 million and recorded a gain of less than $0.1 million. \n \u2022 April 3, 2017, Advantage Pipeline was acquired by a joint venture formed by affiliates of Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. and Noble Midstream Partners LP. We received cash proceeds at closing from the sale of our approximate 30% equity ownership interest in Advantage Pipeline of approximately $25.3 million and recorded a gain on the sale of the investment of $4.2 million. Approximately 10% of the gross sale proceeds were held in escrow, subject to certain post-closing settlement terms and conditions. We received approximately $1.1 million of the funds held in escrow in August 2017 and our remaining balance of $2.2 million in January 2018. \n \u2022 October 5, 2016 - We completed the Ergon Transactions which consisted of the following transactions and agreements: \n \u25e6 Ergon purchased 100% of the outstanding voting stock of Blueknight GP Holding, L.L.C., which owns 100% of the capital stock of our General Partner, pursuant to a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement dated July 19, 2016, among CBB, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Charlesbank, BEHI, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Vitol, and Ergon Asphalt Holdings, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ergon (the previously defined Ergon Change of Control); \n \u25e6 Ergon contributed nine asphalt terminals plus $22.1 million in cash in return for total consideration of approximately $144.7 million, which consisted of the issuance of 18,312,968 of Preferred Units in a private placement; \n \u25e6 we repurchased 6,667,695 Preferred Units from each of Vitol and Charlesbank in a private placement for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $95.3 million. Vitol and Charlesbank each retained 2,488,789 Preferred Units upon completion of these transactions; \n \u25e6 Ergon acquired an aggregate of $5.0 million of common units for cash in a private placement, pursuant to a Contribution Agreement between us, Blueknight Terminal Holding, L.L.C., and three indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Ergon; \n \u25e6 we and Ergon entered into the Storage, Throughput and Handling Agreement under which we operate certain asphalt terminals, storage tanks and related real property, contracts, permits, and related assets previously owned by Ergon, and we store and terminal Ergon's asphalt products in exchange for the payment of certain fees by Ergon. The term of the agreement began on October 5, 2016 and will continue for a period of seven years. The agreement will then continue on a year-to-year basis unless cancelled by either party by delivering not less than 180 days' notice; and \n \u25e6 we entered into the Omnibus Agreement, dated October 5, 2016 (the Omnibus Agreement\u201d), with Ergon pursuant to which Ergon was granted a right of first offer with respect to the (i) Wolcott, Kansas Asphalt Terminal; (ii) Ennis, Texas Asphalt Terminal; (iii) Chandler, Arizona Asphalt/Emulsion Terminal; (iv) Mt. Pleasant, Texas Emulsion Terminal; (v) Pleasanton, Texas Emulsion Terminal; (vi) Birmingport, Alabama Asphalt/Polymer/Emulsion Terminal; (vii) Memphis, Tennessee Asphalt/Polymer/Emulsion Terminal; (viii) Nashville, Tennessee Asphalt/Polymer Terminal; (ix) Yellow Creek, Mississippi Asphalt Terminal; (x) Fontana, California Asphalt/Emulsion Terminal; and (xi) Las Vegas, Nevada Asphalt/Emulsion/Polymer Terminal (collectively, the ROFO Assets\u201d) to the extent that we, as the owner of the ROFO Assets, proposes to transfer such ROFO Asset while the Omnibus Agreement is in effect. In addition, the Omnibus Agreement also granted Ergon a right of first refusal to purchase the (i) Fontana, California Asphalt/Emulsion Terminal and (ii) Las Vegas, Nevada Asphalt/Emulsion/Polymer Terminal (together, the ROFR Assets\u201d) if any owner of the ROFR Assets proposes or intends to sell any ROFR Asset to a third party through the period ending December 31, 2018. \n \u2022 July 26, 2016 - We issued and sold 3,795,000 common units for a public offering price of $5.90 per unit, resulting in proceeds of approximately $21.2 million, net of underwriters' discount and offering expenses of $1.5 million. \n \u2022 July 19, 2016 - We entered into a Second Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement Amendment\u201d), which amended the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of June 28, 2013, with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as administrative agent and the several lenders from time to time party thereto. \n \u2022 June 2016 - We evaluated the prospects of Knight Warrior, a previously announced East Texas Eaglebine/Woodbine crude oil pipeline project, and decided to not pursue development of the project due to continued low rig counts in the Eaglebine/Woodbine area coupled with lower production volumes, competing projects and the overall impact of the decreased market price of crude oil. Consequently, shipper commitments related to the project were canceled, and an impairment expense of $22.6 million related to the project was recognized in June 2016. \nOur Revenues\nOur revenues consist of (i) terminalling revenues, (ii) gathering, transportation and producer field services revenues, (iii) product sales revenues, and (iv) fuel surcharge revenues. On October 5, 2016, Ergon acquired 100% of the outstanding voting stock of our General Partner from Vitol and Charlesbank. Beginning on October 5, 2016, revenue from services provided to Ergon is presented as related-party revenue and revenue from services provided to Vitol is presented as a third-party revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we derived approximately $56.7 million of our revenues from services we provided to related parties, with $56.4 million and $0.3 million attributable to Ergon and Advantage Pipeline, respectively.\nTerminalling revenues consist of (i) storage service fees resulting from short-term and long-term contracts for committed space that may or may not be utilized by the customer in a given month; and (ii) terminal throughput service charges to pump crude oil to connecting carriers or to deliver asphalt product out of our terminals. Terminal throughput service charges are\nrecognized as the crude oil or asphalt product is delivered out of our terminal. Storage service revenues are recognized as the services are provided on a monthly basis. We earn terminalling revenues in two of our segments: (i) crude oil terminalling services and (ii) asphalt terminalling services.\nAs of March 1, 2018, we have approximately 5.4 million barrels of crude oil storage under service contracts, including 4.7 million barrels of crude oil storage contracts that are either month-to-month contracts or expire in 2018. The weighted average remaining term on the service contracts is approximately 11 months, with one contract having a remaining term of 47 months. Storage contracts with Vitol represent 2.2 million barrels of crude oil storage capacity under contract.\nAs of March 7, 2018, we have leases and terminalling agreements for all of our 56 asphalt facilities, including 26 facilities under contract with Ergon. Lease and terminalling agreements related to 16 of these facilities have terms that expire by the end of 2018, while the agreements relating to our additional 40 facilities have on average five years remaining under their terms. We operate the asphalt facilities pursuant to terminalling agreements while our contract counterparties operate the asphalt facilities that are subject to lease agreements.\nGathering and transportation services revenues consist of service fees recognized for the gathering of crude oil for our customers and the transportation of crude oil to refiners, to common carrier pipelines for ultimate delivery to refiners or to terminalling facilities owned by us and others. Revenue for the gathering and transportation of crude oil is recognized when the service is performed and is based upon regulated and non-regulated tariff rates and the related transport volumes. Producer field services revenue consists of a number of services ranging from gathering condensates from natural gas producers to hauling produced water to disposal wells. Revenue for producer field services is recognized when the service is performed. We earn gathering and transportation revenues in two of our segments: (i) crude oil pipeline services and (ii) crude oil trucking and producer field services.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we transported approximately 23,000 Bpd on our pipelines, a decrease of 36% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in volumes is primarily attributable to suspended service on our Mid-Continent pipeline system due to a discovery of a pipeline exposure in April 2016. We are working to\nrestore service of the second Oklahoma pipeline system and expect to put the line back in service by the end of the second quarter of 2018, increasing the transportation capacity of our pipeline systems by approximately 20,000 Bpd. See Crude oil pipeline services within our results of operations discussion for additional detail. Vitol accounted for 57% and 33% of volumes transported in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we transported approximately 21,000 Bpd on our crude transport trucks, a decrease of 22% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. As noted above, we are working to restore service of the second Oklahoma pipeline system and expect to put the line back in service by the end of the second quarter of 2018. When our second Oklahoma pipeline system resumes service, we anticipate an increase in volumes transported by our crude oil transport trucks as we gather barrels to be transported on this pipeline. See Crude oil trucking and producer field services within our results of operations discussion for additional detail. Vitol accounted for approximately 43% and 30% of volumes transported in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nProduct sales revenues are comprised of (i) revenues recognized for the sale of crude oil to our customers that we purchase\nat production leases and (ii) revenue recognized in buy/sell transactions with our customers. Product sales revenue is\nrecognized for products upon delivery and when the customer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. We earn product\nsales revenue in our crude oil pipeline services operating segment.\nFuel surcharge revenues are comprised of revenues recognized for the reimbursement of fuel and power consumed to operate our asphalt terminals. We recognize fuel surcharge revenues in the period in which the related fuel and power expenses are incurred.\nOur Expenses\nOperating expenses increased by 11% in 2017 as compared to 2016. This increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of the nine asphalt terminals from Ergon in October 2016. General and administrative expenses decreased by 15% in 2017 as compared to 2016. This decrease is primarily attributable to expenses incurred in 2016 related to the Ergon Transactions. Our interest expense increased by $1.5 million in 2017 as compared to 2016. See Interest expense within our results of operations discussion for additional detail regarding the factors that contributed to the increase in interest expense in 2017.\nIncome Taxes\nAs part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate the federal and state income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which our subsidiary that is taxed as a corporation operates. This process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. We must then assess, using all available positive and negative evidence, the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. If we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase or decrease this allowance in a period, we must include an expense or reduction of expense within the tax provisions in the consolidated statements of operations.\nUnder ASC 740 - Accounting for Income Taxes, an enterprise must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence. The weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists (a) the more positive evidence is necessary and (b) the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion, or all of the deferred tax asset. Among the more significant types of evidence that we consider are:\n \u2022 taxable income projections in future years; \n \u2022 whether the carryforward period is so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefits; \n \u2022 future revenue and operating cost projections that will produce more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset based on existing service rates and cost structures; and \n \u2022 our earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the future deductible amount coupled with evidence indicating that the loss is an aberration rather than a continuing condition. \nBased on the consideration of the above factors for our subsidiary that is taxed as a corporation for purposes of determining the likelihood of realizing the benefits of the deferred tax assets, we have provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2017.\nOur Assets and Services\nOur network of assets provides our customers the flexibility to access multiple points for the receipt and delivery of crude oil and the terminalling of liquid asphalt and crude oil. Our operations have minimal direct exposure to changes in liquid asphalt and crude oil prices, but the volumes of liquid asphalt and crude oil we terminal, gather or transport are affected by commodity prices. We generate revenues by charging a fee for services provided at each transportation stage as crude oil is shipped from its origin at the wellhead to destination points such as the Cushing Interchange, to refineries in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas or to pipelines and by charging a fee for services provided for the terminalling of liquid asphalt and crude oil.\n \u2022 Asphalt Terminalling Services. Our 56 asphalt terminals are located in 26 states and are well-positioned to provide asphalt terminalling services in the market areas they serve throughout the continental United States. With our approximately 10.3 million barrels of total liquid asphalt storage capacity, we are able to provide our customers the ability to effectively manage their liquid asphalt inventories while allowing significant flexibility in their processing and marketing activities. We currently have terminalling contracts or leases with customers for all of our 56 asphalt facilities. \n \u2022 Crude oil terminalling assets and services. We provide crude oil terminalling services at our terminalling facility located in Oklahoma. We currently own and operate approximately 6.6 million barrels of storage capacity at our terminal in Cushing, Oklahoma. Our Cushing terminal is strategically located within the Cushing Interchange, one of the largest crude oil marketing hubs in the United States and the designated point of delivery specified in all NYMEX crude oil futures contracts. Our terminal has the capacity to receive or deliver approximately 10.0 million barrels of crude oil per month. We also own approximately 50 acres of additional land within the Cushing Interchange where we can develop additional storage capacity. \n \u2022 Crude oil pipeline assets and services. We currently own and operate one pipeline system. Our Mid-Continent pipeline system, which is located in Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle, consists of a combined length of approximately 655 miles of pipelines that gather crude oil for our customers and transport it to refiners, to common carrier pipelines for ultimate delivery to refiners or to terminalling facilities owned by us and others. We previously owned and operated the East Texas pipeline system, which is located in Texas. On April 18, 2017, we sold the East Texas pipeline system. See Note 7 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n \u2022 Crude oil trucking and producer field services. In addition to our pipelines, we use our approximately 65 owned or leased tanker trucks to gather crude oil in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas for our customers at remote wellhead locations generally not connected to pipeline and gathering systems and transport the crude oil to aggregation points and storage facilities located along pipeline gathering and transportation systems. In connection with our gathering services, we also provide a number of producer field services, ranging from gathering condensates from natural gas producers to hauling production waste water to disposal wells. Our producer service fleet consists of approximately 85 trucks in a number of different sizes. \nFactors That Will Significantly Affect Our Results\nCommodity Prices. Although our current operations have minimal direct exposure to commodity prices, the volumes of liquid asphalt and crude oil we terminal, gather or transport are affected by commodity prices. Petroleum product prices may be contango (future prices higher than current prices) or backwardated (future prices lower than current prices) depending on market expectations for future supply and demand. Our terminalling services benefit most from an increasing price environment, when a premium is placed on storage, and our gathering and transportation services benefit most from a declining price environment, when a premium is placed on prompt delivery.\nVolumes. Our results of operations are dependent upon the volumes of liquid asphalt we terminal and crude oil we terminal, gather and transport. An increase or decrease in the production of crude oil from the oil fields served by our pipelines or an increase or decrease in the demand for crude oil in the areas served by our pipelines and terminal facilities will have a corresponding effect on the volumes we terminal, gather or transport. The production and demand for liquid asphalt and crude oil are driven by many factors, including the price of crude oil.\nAcquisition Activities. We may pursue acquisition opportunities. These acquisition efforts may involve assets that, if acquired, would have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We can give no assurance that any such acquisition efforts will be successful or that any such acquisition will be completed on terms ultimately favorable to us.\nOrganic Expansion Activities. We may pursue opportunities to expand our existing asset base and consider constructing additional assets in strategic locations. The construction of additions or modifications to our existing assets and the construction of new assets involve numerous regulatory, environmental, political, legal and operational uncertainties beyond our control and may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital.\nDistributions to our Unitholders. We may make distributions to holders of our Preferred Units and common units as well as to our General Partner. To the extent that substantially all of our cash generated by our operations is used to make such distributions, we expect that we will rely upon external financing sources, including commercial bank borrowings and other debt and equity issuances, to fund our acquisition and expansion capital expenditures, as well as our working capital needs.\nVitol Storage Agreements\nIn recent years, a significant portion of our crude oil storage capacity has been dedicated to Vitol under multiple agreements. As of December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, 2.2 million barrels of storage capacity were dedicated to Vitol under these storage agreements. Service revenues under these agreements are based on the barrels of storage dedicated to Vitol under the applicable agreement at rates that, we believe, are fair and reasonable to us and our unitholders and are comparable with the rates we charge third parties. The Board's conflicts committee reviewed and approved these agreements in accordance with our procedures for approval of related-party transactions and the provisions of the partnership agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated revenues under these agreements of approximately $9.4 million, all of which is classified as related-party revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated revenues under these agreements of approximately $9.6 million, of which $2.1 million was classified as third-party revenue. All revenue for 2017 is classified as third-party revenue.\nAs of March 1, 2018, 2.2 million barrels of storage capacity were dedicated to Vitol under the crude oil storage agreement with the current term scheduled to expire on April 30, 2018. We are in the process of renegotiating this contract, however, we may not be able to extend, renegotiate or replace this contract when it expires and the terms of any renegotiated contracts may not be as favorable as the contracts they replace.\nErgon Agreements\nTwenty-six of our asphalt terminals are contracted to Ergon under multiple agreements. Service revenues under these agreements are primarily based on contracted monthly fees under the applicable agreement at rates, which we believe are fair and reasonable to us and our unitholders and are comparable with the rates we charge third parties. As of March 7, 2018, leases and storage agreements related to 15 of these facilities are scheduled to expire by the end of 2018. We may not be able to extend, renegotiate or replace these contracts when they expire and the terms of any renegotiated contracts may not be as favorable as the contracts they replace. The Board's conflicts committee reviewed and approved these agreements in accordance with our procedures for approval of related-party transactions and the provisions of the partnership agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized revenues of $15.5 million for services provided to Ergon under these agreements, all of which is classified as third-party revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized revenues of $22.1 million for services provided to Ergon under these agreements, of which $10.9 million is classified as related-party revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized revenues of $56.3 million for services provided to Ergon under these agreements, all of which is classified as related-party revenue.\nResults of Operations\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, management uses additional measures that are known as non-GAAP financial measures\u201d in its evaluation of past performance and prospects for the future. The primary measure used by management is operating margin excluding depreciation and amortization.\nManagement believes that the presentation of such additional financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our performance and results of operations because these measures, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, (i) provide additional information about our core operating performance and ability to generate and distribute cash flow; (ii) provide investors with the financial analytical framework upon which management bases financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions; and (iii) present measurements that investors, rating agencies and debt holders have indicated are useful in assessing us and our results of operations. These additional financial measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable measures as reported in accordance with GAAP, and should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, our consolidated financial statements and footnotes.\nThe table below summarizes our financial results for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure:\n\nTotal operating margin excluding depreciation and amortization decreased 3% from 2016 to 2017. Asphalt terminalling services operating margin increased $7.9 million or 14% from 2016 to 2017 as a result of the acquisition of eleven asphalt terminals in 2016, increased product throughput volumes and renegotiated throughput fees for some of our asphalt facilities. This increase was partially offset by decreases in our other operating segments. The decrease in our crude oil terminalling services operating margin was primarily due to decreased throughput fees as lower volumes were transferred in and out of our facilities, coupled with lower re-contracted storage rates as prior contracts expired throughout the year. The crude oil pipeline services operating margin decreased primarily due to a decrease in volume transported by our pipelines related to suspended service on our Mid-Continent pipeline system beginning in April 2016 after a discovery of a pipeline exposure caused by heavy rains and erosion of a river in southern Oklahoma, as well as the sale of our East Texas pipeline system in April 2017.\nTotal operating margin excluding depreciation and amortization increased 9% from 2015 to 2016. Asphalt terminalling services operating margin increased $8.6 million or 18% from 2015 to 2016 as a result of the acquisition of eleven asphalt terminals in 2016, increased product throughput volumes and renegotiated throughput fees for some of our asphalt facilities. This increase was partially offset by decreases in our crude oil pipeline services operating segment, primarily due to a decrease in volume transported by our pipelines related to suspended service on our Mid-Continent pipeline system beginning in April 2016 after a discovery of a pipeline exposure caused by heavy rains and erosion of a river in southern Oklahoma.\nA more detailed analysis of changes in operating margin by segment follows.\nAnalysis of Operating Segments\nAsphalt terminalling services segment\nOur asphalt terminalling services segment operations generally consist of fee-based activities associated with providing terminalling services, including storage, blending, processing and throughput services, for asphalt product and residual fuel oil. Revenue is generated through short- and long-term storage contracts.\nThe following table sets forth our operating results from our asphalt terminalling services segment for the periods indicated:\n\nThe following is a discussion of items impacting our asphalt terminalling services segment operating margin for the periods indicated:\n \u2022 Overall revenues have increased for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the acquisition of eleven asphalt terminals in 2016 as well as increased product throughput at our terminals and renegotiated throughput fees for some of our asphalt facilities. Revenues earned from Ergon moved from third-party to related-party due to the Ergon Change of Control, which resulted in all revenues generated from services provided to Ergon after October 5, 2016, being classified as related-party revenues. \n \u2022 Operating expenses increased in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily as a result of the acquisitions noted above. In addition, operating expenses for 2017 increased by $2.4 million as compared to 2016 as a result of two facilities that we previously leased to customers converting to facilities we operate under service agreements. \n \u2022 Third-party revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the acquisition of two asphalt terminals in February 2016 as well as increased product throughput at our terminals and renegotiated throughput fees for some of our asphalt facilities. Related-party revenues increased due to the acquisition of nine asphalt facilities from Ergon in October 2016 in conjunction with the Ergon Change of Control, which resulted in all revenues generated from services provided to Ergon after October 5, 2016, being classified as related-party revenues. \n \u2022 Operating expenses increased in 2016 as compared to 2015 as a result of an increase in utilities, compensation and maintenance and repair expense primarily due to the acquisition of the eleven new terminals in 2016. \nCrude oil terminalling services segment\nOur terminalling services segment operations generally consist of fee-based activities associated with providing terminalling services, including storage, blending, processing and throughput services, for crude oil. Revenue is generated through short- and long-term storage contracts.\nThe following table sets forth our operating results from our crude oil terminalling services segment for the periods indicated:\n\nThe following is a discussion of items impacting our crude oil terminalling services segment operating margin for the periods indicated:\n \u2022 Total revenues for 2017 have decreased due to a decrease in market rates for short-term, monthly storage contracts and decreased throughput fees as lower volumes were transferred in and out of our facilities. \n \u2022 Revenues earned from Vitol have moved from related-party to third-party due to the October 2016 Ergon Change of Control. We do not provide crude oil terminalling services to Ergon. \n \u2022 Overall operating expenses for 2017 were comparable to 2016. Decreases in maintenance and repair expense were offset by an increase in property tax expense. \n \u2022 Operating expenses for 2016 decreased compared to 2015, primarily as a result of decreases in utilities expense, as well as a decrease in compensation expense due to the cancellation of an operating and maintenance agreement related to Vitol's crude oil terminal located in Midland, Texas in the third quarter of 2015. \n \u2022 As of March 1, 2018, we have approximately 5.4 million barrels of crude oil storage under service contracts, including 4.7 million barrels of crude oil storage contracts that are month-to-month or expire in 2018. The weighted average remaining term on the service contracts is approximately 11 months, with one contract having a remaining term of 47 months. Storage contracts with Vitol represent 2.2 million barrels of crude oil storage capacity under contract. \nCrude oil pipeline services\nOur crude oil pipeline services segment operations generally consist of fee-based activity associated with transporting crude oil products on pipelines. Revenues are generated primarily through tariffs and other transportation fees.\nThe following table sets forth our operating results from our crude oil pipeline services segment for the periods indicated: \n_______________\n (1) Average throughput on the East Texas system for 2017 was calculated based on the period of time we operated the system (January 1, 2017 through April 18, 2017). \nThe following is a discussion of items impacting our crude oil pipeline services segment operating margin for the periods indicated:\n \u2022 In late April 2016, as a precautionary measure we suspended service on our Mid-Continent pipeline system due to discovery of a pipeline exposure caused by heavy rains and the erosion of a riverbed in southern Oklahoma. There was no damage to the pipe and no loss of product. In the second quarter of 2016, we took action to mitigate the service suspension and worked with customers to divert volumes and, in certain circumstances, transported volumes to a third-party pipeline system via truck. In addition, the term of the throughput and deficiency agreement on our Eagle North pipeline system expired on June 30, 2016, and in July 2016 we completed a connection of the southeastern-most portion of our Mid-Continent pipeline system to our Eagle North pipeline system and concurrently reversed the Eagle North pipeline system. This enabled us to recapture diverted volumes and deliver those barrels to Cushing, Oklahoma. We are currently operating one Oklahoma mainline system, which is a combination of both the Mid-Continent and Eagle North pipeline systems, instead of two separate systems, providing us with a current capacity of approximately 20,000 to 25,000 Bpd. We are working to restore service of the second Oklahoma pipeline system and expect to put the line back in service by the end of the second quarter of 2018, increasing the transportation capacity of our pipeline systems by approximately 20,000 Bpd. The ability to fully utilize the capacity of these systems may be impacted by the market price of crude oil and producers' decisions to increase or decrease production in the areas we serve. \n \u2022 Service revenues have moved from related-party to third-party due to Ergon's acquisition of our General Partner in October 2016, at which time Vitol ceased to be a related party. \n \u2022 Included in product sales revenue for the year ended 2016 is $4.2 million in sales of crude oil arising from accumulated product-loss allowances ( PLA\u201d). Product sales revenue for 2017 included $0.3 million in PLA sales. In \naddition, as a result of one of our third-party customers utilizing a greater percentage of the capacity of our Red River pipeline, product sales revenue and cost of product sales declined from 2016 to 2017, which decreased the volume of marketed barrels of crude oil, for which revenue and costs are both recorded gross. This decrease was offset by an increase in third-party transportation revenue.\n \u2022 On April 18, 2017, we sold the East Texas pipeline system. We received cash proceeds at closing of approximately $4.8 million and recorded a gain of less than $0.1 million. The sale of the East Texas pipeline system resulted in decreased service revenues of $2.2 million for year ended 2017 as compared to 2016. \n \u2022 Operating expenses decreased for 2017 by $1.5 million compared to 2016 as a result of the sale of the East Texas pipeline system and by $0.7 million as a result of the sale of our investment in Advantage Pipeline, for which we provided operational and administrative services through August 1, 2017. Offsetting this decrease was a $0.3 million right-of-way settlement incurred in December 2017 related to the pipeline exposure described above. \n \u2022 Service revenues for 2016 decreased compared to 2015 due to the expiration of an increased tariff that was being charged from June 2014 through May 2015 on certain barrels transported on our East Texas pipeline system under a throughput and deficiency agreement. The tariff returned to a lower rate in June 2015, which decreased the service revenues generated on the East Texas pipeline system by $4.6 million compared to 2015. \n \u2022 Product sales revenues and cost of product sales for 2016 increased compared to 2015 due to our acquisition of the Red River pipeline in November 2015. In conjunction with our acquisition of the Red River pipeline, we began marketing crude oil that we purchase at production leases. Revenue from this activity is reflected in product sales revenue. In addition to the marketing revenue, we also had $4.2 million in sales of crude oil arising from accumulated product loss allowances in 2016. There were no sales of accumulated pipeline loss allowances during 2015. \n \u2022 Operating expenses for 2016 decreased compared to 2015 primarily due to decreases in maintenance and repairs. \nCrude oil trucking and producer field services\nOur crude oil trucking and producer field services segment operations generally consist of fee-based activity associated with transporting crude oil products on trucks. Revenues are generated primarily through transportation fees.\nThe following table sets forth our operating results from our crude oil trucking and producer field services segment for the periods indicated: \nThe following is a discussion of items impacting our crude oil trucking and producer field services segment operating margin for the periods indicated:\n \u2022 Service revenues and operating expenses have decreased as a result of the continued low crude oil price environment  and increased competition in the areas we serve. We continue to experience downward rate pressure in our trucking and producer field services business as producers and marketers attempt to renegotiate service rates to preserve their operating margins in the changing market.\n \u2022 Revenues have moved from related-party to third-party due to Ergon's acquisition of our General Partner in October 2016, at which time Vitol ceased to be a related party. We do not provide crude oil transportation services to Ergon. \n \u2022 Increases in product sales revenues for 2017 are the result of a crude oil sale in our field services business to a third party. Intersegment product sales revenues for all periods are the result of crude oil sales in our field services business to our crude oil pipeline services segment. \n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized total fixed asset and intangible asset impairment charges of $2.4 million related to the producer field services business. \n \u2022 During the second half of 2015, our West Texas operating margins and transported volumes were negatively impacted by increased competition from transporters and marketers quickly pipe-connecting transported barrels. As a result, we decided to cease trucking barrels in West Texas and refocus our efforts on transporting barrels around our owned crude oil pipelines and storage assets in Oklahoma and Kansas. We recorded a restructuring expense of $1.6 million related to employee severance and idle equipment costs related to our exit from the West Texas trucking business in 2015. This restructuring led to the improvement in operating margin from 2015 to 2016 despite decreased volumes and rates. \nOther Income and Expenses\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased to $31.1 million for 2017 compared to $30.8 million for 2016 and $27.2 million for 2015. These increases are primarily the result of pipeline and asphalt facility acquisitions made during the past two years.\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense was $17.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $20.0 million for 2016 and $19.0 million for 2015. The increase in expense for 2016 over 2017 and 2015 is primarily related to $1.8 million of transaction fees related to the Ergon Change of Control and acquisition-related expenses.\nAsset impairment expense. During 2017, we recorded fixed asset and intangible asset impairment expense, including an impairment of goodwill, of $2.4 million related to a write-down of our producer field services business to estimated fair value. During 2016, we recorded fixed asset impairment expense of $25.8 million, primarily due to an impairment recognized on the Knight Warrior pipeline project and the East Texas pipeline system. The Knight Warrior pipeline project was canceled due to continued low rig counts in the Eaglebine/Woodbine area coupled with lower production volumes, competing projects and the overall impact of the decreased market price of crude oil. Consequently, shipper commitments related to the project were canceled. During 2015, we recorded fixed asset impairment expenses of $12.6 million, $1.4 million, and $0.5 million related to the write-down of our East Texas pipeline system, a portion of our Mid-Continent pipeline system and our West Texas trucking stations, respectively, to their estimated fair value. In 2015, we also recorded an impairment expense of $7.5 million related to goodwill associated with our pipeline services reporting unit. We used a discounted cash flow model, supplemented by a market approach, to evaluate goodwill and the estimated fair value of assets. Key assumptions in the analysis include the use of an appropriate discount rate, volume and rate forecasts and estimates of operating costs. Due to the imprecise nature of our projections and assumptions, actual results can and often do differ from our estimates. If the assumptions used in our projections and analysis prove to be inaccurate or if the markets in which we operate experience future adverse conditions, we could incur additional impairment charges in the future.\nGain (loss) on sale of assets. Loss on sale of assets was $1.0 million in 2017 compared to gains of $0.1 million and $6.1 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. Losses for 2017 include $0.4 million related to the disposal of an asphalt tank floor that had to be replaced due to corrosion. Additional losses in 2017 were the result of sales and disposals of surplus, used property and equipment. The gain on sale of assets in 2016 consists of the sale of surplus, used property and equipment. The gain on sale of assets in 2015 includes a $6.0 million gain on the sale of crude oil pipeline linefill and storage tank bottoms related to the settlement", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOverview\nWe are a publicly traded master limited partnership with operations in 27 states. We provide integrated terminalling, gathering and transportation services for companies engaged in the production, distribution and marketing of liquid asphalt and crude oil. We manage our operations through four operating segments: (i) asphalt terminalling services, (ii) crude oil terminalling services, (iii) crude oil pipeline services and (iv) crude oil trucking and producer field services.\nPotential Impact of Crude Oil Market Price Changes and Other Factors on Future Revenues\nSince June of 2014, the market price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil has fluctuated significantly from a peak of approximately $108 per barrel to a low of approximately $30 per barrel (as of March 1, 2018, the price per barrel was approximately $63). Furthermore, during the fourth quarter of 2014, the West Texas Intermediate crude oil forward price curve changed from a backwardated curve (in which the current crude oil price per barrel is higher than the future price per barrel and a premium is placed on delivering product to market and selling as soon as possible) to a contango curve (in which future prices are higher than current prices and a premium is placed on storing product and selling at a later time). As of December 31, 2017, the forward price curve is slightly backwardated. In addition to changes in the price of crude oil and changes in the forward pricing curve, there has been significant volatility in the overall energy industry and specifically in publicly traded midstream energy partnerships. As a result there are a number of trends that may impact our partnership in the near term. These include the overall market price for crude oil and whether or not the forward price curve is in contango or backwardated, changes in production and the demand for transportation capacity in the areas in which we serve, and overall changes in our cost of capital. We expect this volatility to have near-term impacts as discussed below.\nAsphalt Terminalling Services - Although there is no direct correlation between the price of crude oil and the price of asphalt, the asphalt industry tends to benefit from a lower crude oil price environment, strong economy and an increase in infrastructure spend. As a result, we do not expect the changes in the price of crude oil to significantly impact our asphalt terminalling services operating segment.\nCrude Oil Terminalling Services - A contango crude oil curve tends to favor the crude oil storage business as crude oil marketers are incentivized to store crude oil during the current month and sell into a future month. As a result of the decrease in the crude oil price and change in the crude oil futures pricing curve, our weighted average storage rates increased from September 2014 to March 2016. Since March of 2016, the crude oil curve has generally been in a shallow contango, meaning the current price of oil is only slightly less than the price in future months. In these shallow contango markets there is no clear incentive for marketers to store barrels. As of December 31, 2017, the forward price curve is slightly backwardated. In addition, a shallow contango or a backwardated market may impact our ability to re-contract expiring contracts and/or decrease the storage rate at which we are able to re-contract.\nCrude Oil Pipeline Services - In late April 2016, as a precautionary measure, we suspended service on a segment of our Mid-Continent pipeline system due to a discovery of a pipeline exposure caused by heavy rains and the erosion of a riverbed in southern Oklahoma. There was no damage to the pipeline and no loss of product. In the second quarter of 2016, we took action to mitigate the service suspension and worked with customers to divert volumes, and, in certain circumstances, transported volumes to a third-party pipeline system via truck. In addition, the term of the throughput and deficiency agreement on our Eagle North pipeline system expired at June 30, 2016, and, in July of 2016, we completed a connection of the southeastern most portion of our Mid-Continent pipeline system to our Eagle North pipeline system and concurrently reversed the Eagle North pipeline system.\nWe are currently operating one Oklahoma mainline system, which is a combination of both the Mid-Continent and Eagle North pipeline systems instead of two separate systems, providing us with a current capacity of approximately 20,000 to 25,000 Bpd. We are working to restore service of the second Oklahoma pipeline system and expect to put the line back in service by the end of the second quarter of 2018, increasing the transportation capacity of our pipeline systems by approximately 20,000 Bpd. The ability to fully utilize the capacity of these systems may be impacted by the market price of crude oil and producers' decisions to increase or decrease production in the areas we serve.\nWe experienced a decrease in revenue on our East Texas pipeline system as a result of an overall decrease in production in the area and the expiration of an incentive tariff on a section of the system in 2015. As a result of the decrease in revenues and resulting decline in market values, we recognized non-cash impairment expenses of $12.6 million and $1.4 million related to our East Texas pipeline system and a portion of our Mid-Continent pipeline system, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2015 and an additional $2.3 million related to our East Texas pipeline system in the fourth quarter of 2016. On April 18, 2017, we sold the East Texas pipeline system. We received cash proceeds at closing of approximately $4.8 million and recorded a gain of less than $0.1 million.\nThe Knight Warrior project was canceled during the second quarter of 2016 due to continued low rig counts in the Eaglebine/Woodbine area coupled with lower production volumes, competing projects and the overall impact of the decreased market price of crude oil. Consequently, shipper commitments related to the project were cancelled, and an impairment expense of $22.6 million related to the project was recognized in June 2016.\nOn April 3, 2017, Advantage Pipeline, L.L.C. ( Advantage Pipeline\u201d), in which we owned an approximate 30% equity ownership interest, was acquired by a joint venture formed by affiliates of Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. and Noble Midstream Partners LP. We received cash proceeds at closing from the sale of our approximate 30% equity ownership interest in Advantage Pipeline of approximately $25.3 million and recorded a gain on the sale of the investment of $4.2 million. Approximately 10% of the gross sale proceeds were held in escrow, subject to certain post-closing settlement terms and conditions. We received approximately $1.1 million of the funds held in escrow in August 2017 and our remaining balance of $2.2 million in January 2018.\nCrude Oil Trucking and Producer Field Services - A backwardated crude oil curve tends to favor the crude oil transportation services business as crude oil marketers are incentivized to deliver crude oil to market and sell as soon as possible. When the crude oil market curve changed from a backwardated curve to a contango curve in the fourth quarter of 2014, coupled with a decrease in the absolute price of crude oil, transported volumes started decreasing. Throughout 2015, we experienced downward rate pressure in our trucking and producer field services business as producers and marketers attempted to renegotiate service rates to preserve their operating margins in the changing market. In addition, during the second half of 2015, our West Texas operating margins and transported volumes were negatively impacted by increased competition from transporters moving equipment from crude oil shale areas to West Texas, where crude oil volumes have remained relatively consistent, and by producers and marketers quickly pipe-connecting transported barrels. As a result, we decided to cease trucking barrels in West Texas in the fourth quarter of 2015 and refocus our efforts on transporting barrels around our owned crude oil pipelines and storage assets in Oklahoma and Kansas. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a restructuring charge of $1.6 million associated with our exit from West Texas in addition to a non-cash impairment expense of $0.5 million associated with a write-down of assets to their estimated net realizable value. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional detail regarding this restructuring expense. In addition, in December 2017, we evaluated our producer field services business for impairment and recognized an impairment expense of $2.4 million to record our assets at their estimated fair value.\nRecent Events\nA time line of certain recent events is set forth below.\n \u2022 On March 7, 2018, we acquired an asphalt terminalling facility located in Oklahoma from a third party for $22.0 million. \n \u2022 On December 1, 2017, we consummated a Purchase & Sale Agreement, dated as of November 22, 2017, among us and Ergon Asphalt & Emulsions, Inc. and Ergon Terminaling, Inc., both subsidiaries of Ergon, Inc., relating to the acquisition of an asphalt terminalling facility located in Bainbridge, Georgia, from Ergon Asphalt & Emulsions, Inc. and Ergon Terminaling, Inc. for a total purchase price of $10.2 million, consisting of 1,898,380 common units representing limited partner interests in us. \n \u2022 On May 11, 2017, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement that consists of a $450.0 million revolving loan facility. \n \u2022 On April 18, 2017, we sold the East Texas pipeline system. We received cash proceeds at closing of approximately $4.8 million and recorded a gain of less than $0.1 million. \n \u2022 April 3, 2017, Advantage Pipeline was acquired by a joint venture formed by affiliates of Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. and Noble Midstream Partners LP. We received cash proceeds at closing from the sale of our approximate 30% equity ownership interest in Advantage Pipeline of approximately $25.3 million and recorded a gain on the sale of the investment of $4.2 million. Approximately 10% of the gross sale proceeds were held in escrow, subject to certain post-closing settlement terms and conditions. We received approximately $1.1 million of the funds held in escrow in August 2017 and our remaining balance of $2.2 million in January 2018. \n \u2022 October 5, 2016 - We completed the Ergon Transactions which consisted of the following transactions and agreements: \n \u25e6 Ergon purchased 100% of the outstanding voting stock of Blueknight GP Holding, L.L.C., which owns 100% of the capital stock of our General Partner, pursuant to a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement dated July 19, 2016, among CBB, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Charlesbank, BEHI, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Vitol, and Ergon Asphalt Holdings, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ergon (the previously defined Ergon Change of Control); \n \u25e6 Ergon contributed nine asphalt terminals plus $22.1 million in cash in return for total consideration of approximately $144.7 million, which consisted of the issuance of 18,312,968 of Preferred Units in a private placement; \n \u25e6 we repurchased 6,667,695 Preferred Units from each of Vitol and Charlesbank in a private placement for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $95.3 million. Vitol and Charlesbank each retained 2,488,789 Preferred Units upon completion of these transactions; \n \u25e6 Ergon acquired an aggregate of $5.0 million of common units for cash in a private placement, pursuant to a Contribution Agreement between us, Blueknight Terminal Holding, L.L.C., and three indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Ergon; \n \u25e6 we and Ergon entered into the Storage, Throughput and Handling Agreement under which we operate certain asphalt terminals, storage tanks and related real property, contracts, permits, and related assets previously owned by Ergon, and we store and terminal Ergon's asphalt products in exchange for the payment of certain fees by Ergon. The term of the agreement began on October 5, 2016 and will continue for a period of seven years. The agreement will then continue on a year-to-year basis unless cancelled by either party by delivering not less than 180 days' notice; and \n \u25e6 we entered into the Omnibus Agreement, dated October 5, 2016 (the Omnibus Agreement\u201d), with Ergon pursuant to which Ergon was granted a right of first offer with respect to the (i) Wolcott, Kansas Asphalt Terminal; (ii) Ennis, Texas Asphalt Terminal; (iii) Chandler, Arizona Asphalt/Emulsion Terminal; (iv) Mt. Pleasant, Texas Emulsion Terminal; (v) Pleasanton, Texas Emulsion Terminal; (vi) Birmingport, Alabama Asphalt/Polymer/Emulsion Terminal; (vii) Memphis, Tennessee Asphalt/Polymer/Emulsion Terminal; (viii) Nashville, Tennessee Asphalt/Polymer Terminal; (ix) Yellow Creek, Mississippi Asphalt Terminal; (x) Fontana, California Asphalt/Emulsion Terminal; and (xi) Las Vegas, Nevada Asphalt/Emulsion/Polymer Terminal (collectively, the ROFO Assets\u201d) to the extent that we, as the owner of the ROFO Assets, proposes to transfer such ROFO Asset while the Omnibus Agreement is in effect. In addition, the Omnibus Agreement also granted Ergon a right of first refusal to purchase the (i) Fontana, California Asphalt/Emulsion Terminal and (ii) Las Vegas, Nevada Asphalt/Emulsion/Polymer Terminal (together, the ROFR Assets\u201d) if any owner of the ROFR Assets proposes or intends to sell any ROFR Asset to a third party through the period ending December 31, 2018. \n \u2022 July 26, 2016 - We issued and sold 3,795,000 common units for a public offering price of $5.90 per unit, resulting in proceeds of approximately $21.2 million, net of underwriters' discount and offering expenses of $1.5 million. \n \u2022 July 19, 2016 - We entered into a Second Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement Amendment\u201d), which amended the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of June 28, 2013, with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as administrative agent and the several lenders from time to time party thereto. \n \u2022 June 2016 - We evaluated the prospects of Knight Warrior, a previously announced East Texas Eaglebine/Woodbine crude oil pipeline project, and decided to not pursue development of the project due to continued low rig counts in the Eaglebine/Woodbine area coupled with lower production volumes, competing projects and the overall impact of the decreased market price of crude oil. Consequently, shipper commitments related to the project were canceled, and an impairment expense of $22.6 million related to the project was recognized in June 2016. \nOur Revenues\nOur revenues consist of (i) terminalling revenues, (ii) gathering, transportation and producer field services revenues, (iii) product sales revenues, and (iv) fuel surcharge revenues. On October 5, 2016, Ergon acquired 100% of the outstanding voting stock of our General Partner from Vitol and Charlesbank. Beginning on October 5, 2016, revenue from services provided to Ergon is presented as related-party revenue and revenue from services provided to Vitol is presented as a third-party revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we derived approximately $56.7 million of our revenues from services we provided to related parties, with $56.4 million and $0.3 million attributable to Ergon and Advantage Pipeline, respectively.\nTerminalling revenues consist of (i) storage service fees resulting from short-term and long-term contracts for committed space that may or may not be utilized by the customer in a given month; and (ii) terminal throughput service charges to pump crude oil to connecting carriers or to deliver asphalt product out of our terminals. Terminal throughput service charges are\nrecognized as the crude oil or asphalt product is delivered out of our terminal. Storage service revenues are recognized as the services are provided on a monthly basis. We earn terminalling revenues in two of our segments: (i) crude oil terminalling services and (ii) asphalt terminalling services.\nAs of March 1, 2018, we have approximately 5.4 million barrels of crude oil storage under service contracts, including 4.7 million barrels of crude oil storage contracts that are either month-to-month contracts or expire in 2018. The weighted average remaining term on the service contracts is approximately 11 months, with one contract having a remaining term of 47 months. Storage contracts with Vitol represent 2.2 million barrels of crude oil storage capacity under contract.\nAs of March 7, 2018, we have leases and terminalling agreements for all of our 56 asphalt facilities, including 26 facilities under contract with Ergon. Lease and terminalling agreements related to 16 of these facilities have terms that expire by the end of 2018, while the agreements relating to our additional 40 facilities have on average five years remaining under their terms. We operate the asphalt facilities pursuant to terminalling agreements while our contract counterparties operate the asphalt facilities that are subject to lease agreements.\nGathering and transportation services revenues consist of service fees recognized for the gathering of crude oil for our customers and the transportation of crude oil to refiners, to common carrier pipelines for ultimate delivery to refiners or to terminalling facilities owned by us and others. Revenue for the gathering and transportation of crude oil is recognized when the service is performed and is based upon regulated and non-regulated tariff rates and the related transport volumes. Producer field services revenue consists of a number of services ranging from gathering condensates from natural gas producers to hauling produced water to disposal wells. Revenue for producer field services is recognized when the service is performed. We earn gathering and transportation revenues in two of our segments: (i) crude oil pipeline services and (ii) crude oil trucking and producer field services.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we transported approximately 23,000 Bpd on our pipelines, a decrease of 36% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in volumes is primarily attributable to suspended service on our Mid-Continent pipeline system due to a discovery of a pipeline exposure in April 2016. We are working to\nrestore service of the second Oklahoma pipeline system and expect to put the line back in service by the end of the second quarter of 2018, increasing the transportation capacity of our pipeline systems by approximately 20,000 Bpd. See Crude oil pipeline services within our results of operations discussion for additional detail. Vitol accounted for 57% and 33% of volumes transported in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we transported approximately 21,000 Bpd on our crude transport trucks, a decrease of 22% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. As noted above, we are working to restore service of the second Oklahoma pipeline system and expect to put the line back in service by the end of the second quarter of 2018. When our second Oklahoma pipeline system resumes service, we anticipate an increase in volumes transported by our crude oil transport trucks as we gather barrels to be transported on this pipeline. See Crude oil trucking and producer field services within our results of operations discussion for additional detail. Vitol accounted for approximately 43% and 30% of volumes transported in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nProduct sales revenues are comprised of (i) revenues recognized for the sale of crude oil to our customers that we purchase\nat production leases and (ii) revenue recognized in buy/sell transactions with our customers. Product sales revenue is\nrecognized for products upon delivery and when the customer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. We earn product\nsales revenue in our crude oil pipeline services operating segment.\nFuel surcharge revenues are comprised of revenues recognized for the reimbursement of fuel and power consumed to operate our asphalt terminals. We recognize fuel surcharge revenues in the period in which the related fuel and power expenses are incurred.\nOur Expenses\nOperating expenses increased by 11% in 2017 as compared to 2016. This increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of the nine asphalt terminals from Ergon in October 2016. General and administrative expenses decreased by 15% in 2017 as compared to 2016. This decrease is primarily attributable to expenses incurred in 2016 related to the Ergon Transactions. Our interest expense increased by $1.5 million in 2017 as compared to 2016. See Interest expense within our results of operations discussion for additional detail regarding the factors that contributed to the increase in interest expense in 2017.\nIncome Taxes\nAs part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate the federal and state income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which our subsidiary that is taxed as a corporation operates. This process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. We must then assess, using all available positive and negative evidence, the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. If we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase or decrease this allowance in a period, we must include an expense or reduction of expense within the tax provisions in the consolidated statements of operations.\nUnder ASC 740 - Accounting for Income Taxes, an enterprise must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence. The weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists (a) the more positive evidence is necessary and (b) the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion, or all of the deferred tax asset. Among the more significant types of evidence that we consider are:\n \u2022 taxable income projections in future years; \n \u2022 whether the carryforward period is so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefits; \n \u2022 future revenue and operating cost projections that will produce more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset based on existing service rates and cost structures; and \n \u2022 our earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the future deductible amount coupled with evidence indicating that the loss is an aberration rather than a continuing condition. \nBased on the consideration of the above factors for our subsidiary that is taxed as a corporation for purposes of determining the likelihood of realizing the benefits of the deferred tax assets, we have provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2017.\nOur Assets and Services\nOur network of assets provides our customers the flexibility to access multiple points for the receipt and delivery of crude oil and the terminalling of liquid asphalt and crude oil. Our operations have minimal direct exposure to changes in liquid asphalt and crude oil prices, but the volumes of liquid asphalt and crude oil we terminal, gather or transport are affected by commodity prices. We generate revenues by charging a fee for services provided at each transportation stage as crude oil is shipped from its origin at the wellhead to destination points such as the Cushing Interchange, to refineries in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas or to pipelines and by charging a fee for services provided for the terminalling of liquid asphalt and crude oil.\n \u2022 Asphalt Terminalling Services. Our 56 asphalt terminals are located in 26 states and are well-positioned to provide asphalt terminalling services in the market areas they serve throughout the continental United States. With our approximately 10.3 million barrels of total liquid asphalt storage capacity, we are able to provide our customers the ability to effectively manage their liquid asphalt inventories while allowing significant flexibility in their processing and marketing activities. We currently have terminalling contracts or leases with customers for all of our 56 asphalt facilities. \n \u2022 Crude oil terminalling assets and services. We provide crude oil terminalling services at our terminalling facility located in Oklahoma. We currently own and operate approximately 6.6 million barrels of storage capacity at our terminal in Cushing, Oklahoma. Our Cushing terminal is strategically located within the Cushing Interchange, one of the largest crude oil marketing hubs in the United States and the designated point of delivery specified in all NYMEX crude oil futures contracts. Our terminal has the capacity to receive or deliver approximately 10.0 million barrels of crude oil per month. We also own approximately 50 acres of additional land within the Cushing Interchange where we can develop additional storage capacity. \n \u2022 Crude oil pipeline assets and services. We currently own and operate one pipeline system. Our Mid-Continent pipeline system, which is located in Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle, consists of a combined length of approximately 655 miles of pipelines that gather crude oil for our customers and transport it to refiners, to common carrier pipelines for ultimate delivery to refiners or to terminalling facilities owned by us and others. We previously owned and operated the East Texas pipeline system, which is located in Texas. On April 18, 2017, we sold the East Texas pipeline system. See Note 7 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n \u2022 Crude oil trucking and producer field services. In addition to our pipelines, we use our approximately 65 owned or leased tanker trucks to gather crude oil in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas for our customers at remote wellhead locations generally not connected to pipeline and gathering systems and transport the crude oil to aggregation points and storage facilities located along pipeline gathering and transportation systems. In connection with our gathering services, we also provide a number of producer field services, ranging from gathering condensates from natural gas producers to hauling production waste water to disposal wells. Our producer service fleet consists of approximately 85 trucks in a number of different sizes. \nFactors That Will Significantly Affect Our Results\nCommodity Prices. Although our current operations have minimal direct exposure to commodity prices, the volumes of liquid asphalt and crude oil we terminal, gather or transport are affected by commodity prices. Petroleum product prices may be contango (future prices higher than current prices) or backwardated (future prices lower than current prices) depending on market expectations for future supply and demand. Our terminalling services benefit most from an increasing price environment, when a premium is placed on storage, and our gathering and transportation services benefit most from a declining price environment, when a premium is placed on prompt delivery.\nVolumes. Our results of operations are dependent upon the volumes of liquid asphalt we terminal and crude oil we terminal, gather and transport. An increase or decrease in the production of crude oil from the oil fields served by our pipelines or an increase or decrease in the demand for crude oil in the areas served by our pipelines and terminal facilities will have a corresponding effect on the volumes we terminal, gather or transport. The production and demand for liquid asphalt and crude oil are driven by many factors, including the price of crude oil.\nAcquisition Activities. We may pursue acquisition opportunities. These acquisition efforts may involve assets that, if acquired, would have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We can give no assurance that any such acquisition efforts will be successful or that any such acquisition will be completed on terms ultimately favorable to us.\nOrganic Expansion Activities. We may pursue opportunities to expand our existing asset base and consider constructing additional assets in strategic locations. The construction of additions or modifications to our existing assets and the construction of new assets involve numerous regulatory, environmental, political, legal and operational uncertainties beyond our control and may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital.\nDistributions to our Unitholders. We may make distributions to holders of our Preferred Units and common units as well as to our General Partner. To the extent that substantially all of our cash generated by our operations is used to make such distributions, we expect that we will rely upon external financing sources, including commercial bank borrowings and other debt and equity issuances, to fund our acquisition and expansion capital expenditures, as well as our working capital needs.\nVitol Storage Agreements\nIn recent years, a significant portion of our crude oil storage capacity has been dedicated to Vitol under multiple agreements. As of December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, 2.2 million barrels of storage capacity were dedicated to Vitol under these storage agreements. Service revenues under these agreements are based on the barrels of storage dedicated to Vitol under the applicable agreement at rates that, we believe, are fair and reasonable to us and our unitholders and are comparable with the rates we charge third parties. The Board's conflicts committee reviewed and approved these agreements in accordance with our procedures for approval of related-party transactions and the provisions of the partnership agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated revenues under these agreements of approximately $9.4 million, all of which is classified as related-party revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated revenues under these agreements of approximately $9.6 million, of which $2.1 million was classified as third-party revenue. All revenue for 2017 is classified as third-party revenue.\nAs of March 1, 2018, 2.2 million barrels of storage capacity were dedicated to Vitol under the crude oil storage agreement with the current term scheduled to expire on April 30, 2018. We are in the process of renegotiating this contract, however, we may not be able to extend, renegotiate or replace this contract when it expires and the terms of any renegotiated contracts may not be as favorable as the contracts they replace.\nErgon Agreements\nTwenty-six of our asphalt terminals are contracted to Ergon under multiple agreements. Service revenues under these agreements are primarily based on contracted monthly fees under the applicable agreement at rates, which we believe are fair and reasonable to us and our unitholders and are comparable with the rates we charge third parties. As of March 7, 2018, leases and storage agreements related to 15 of these facilities are scheduled to expire by the end of 2018. We may not be able to extend, renegotiate or replace these contracts when they expire and the terms of any renegotiated contracts may not be as favorable as the contracts they replace. The Board's conflicts committee reviewed and approved these agreements in accordance with our procedures for approval of related-party transactions and the provisions of the partnership agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized revenues of $15.5 million for services provided to Ergon under these agreements, all of which is classified as third-party revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized revenues of $22.1 million for services provided to Ergon under these agreements, of which $10.9 million is classified as related-party revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized revenues of $56.3 million for services provided to Ergon under these agreements, all of which is classified as related-party revenue.\nResults of Operations\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, management uses additional measures that are known as non-GAAP financial measures\u201d in its evaluation of past performance and prospects for the future. The primary measure used by management is operating margin excluding depreciation and amortization.\nManagement believes that the presentation of such additional financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our performance and results of operations because these measures, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, (i) provide additional information about our core operating performance and ability to generate and distribute cash flow; (ii) provide investors with the financial analytical framework upon which management bases financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions; and (iii) present measurements that investors, rating agencies and debt holders have indicated are useful in assessing us and our results of operations. These additional financial measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable measures as reported in accordance with GAAP, and should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, our consolidated financial statements and footnotes.\nThe table below summarizes our financial results for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP

3% from 2016 to 2017. Asphalt terminalling services operating margin increased $7.9 million or 14% from 2016 to 2017 as a result of the acquisition of eleven asphalt terminals in 2016, increased product throughput volumes and renegotiated throughput fees for some of our asphalt facilities. This increase was partially offset by decreases in our other operating segments. The decrease in our crude oil terminalling services operating margin was primarily due to decreased throughput fees as lower volumes were transferred in and out of our facilities, coupled with lower re-contracted storage rates as prior contracts expired throughout the year. The crude oil pipeline services operating margin decreased primarily due to a decrease in volume transported by our pipelines related to suspended service on our Mid-Continent pipeline system beginning in April 2016 after a discovery of a pipeline exposure caused by heavy rains and erosion of a river in southern Oklahoma, as well as the sale of our East Texas pipeline system in April 2017.\nTotal operating margin excluding depreciation and amortization increased 9% from 2015 to 2016. Asphalt terminalling services operating margin increased $8.6 million or 18% from 2015 to 2016 as a result of the acquisition of eleven asphalt terminals in 2016, increased product throughput volumes and renegotiated throughput fees for some of our asphalt facilities. This increase was partially offset by decreases in our crude oil pipeline services operating segment, primarily due to a decrease in volume transported by our pipelines related to suspended service on our Mid-Continent pipeline system beginning in April 2016 after a discovery of a pipeline exposure caused by heavy rains and erosion of a river in southern Oklahoma.\nA more detailed analysis of changes in operating margin by segment follows.\nAnalysis of Operating Segments\nAsphalt terminalling services segment\nOur asphalt terminalling services segment operations generally consist of fee-based activities associated with providing terminalling services, including storage, blending, processing and throughput services, for asphalt product and residual fuel oil.

Revenues earned from Ergon moved from third-party to related-party due to the Ergon Change of Control, which resulted in all revenues generated from services provided to Ergon after October 5, 2016, being classified as related-party revenues. \n \u2022 Operating expenses increased in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily as a result of the acquisitions noted above. In addition, operating expenses for 2017 increased by $2.4 million as compared to 2016 as a result of two facilities that we previously leased to customers converting to facilities we operate under service agreements. \n \u2022 Third-party revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the acquisition of two asphalt terminals in February 2016 as well as increased product throughput at our terminals and renegotiated throughput fees for some of our asphalt facilities. Related-party revenues increased due to the acquisition of nine asphalt facilities from Ergon in October 2016 in conjunction with the Ergon Change of Control, which resulted in all revenues generated from services provided to Ergon after October 5, 2016, being classified as related-party revenues. \n \u2022 Operating expenses increased in 2016 as compared to 2015 as a result of an increase in utilities, compensation and maintenance and repair expense primarily due to the acquisition of the eleven new terminals in 2016. \nCrude oil terminalling services segment\nOur terminalling services segment operations generally consist of fee-based activities associated with providing terminalling services, including storage, blending, processing and throughput services, for crude oil.

We do not provide crude oil terminalling services to Ergon. \n \u2022 Overall operating expenses for 2017 were comparable to 2016. Decreases in maintenance and repair expense were offset by an increase in property tax expense. \n \u2022 Operating expenses for 2016 decreased compared to 2015, primarily as a result of decreases in utilities expense, as well as a decrease in compensation expense due to the cancellation of an operating and maintenance agreement related to Vitol's crude oil terminal located in Midland, Texas in the third quarter of 2015. \n \u2022 As of March 1, 2018, we have approximately 5.4 million barrels of crude oil storage under service contracts, including 4.7 million barrels of crude oil storage contracts that are month-to-month or expire in 2018. The weighted average remaining term on the service contracts is approximately 11 months, with one contract having a remaining term of 47 months. Storage contracts with Vitol represent 2.2 million barrels of crude oil storage capacity under contract. \nCrude oil pipeline services\nOur crude oil pipeline services segment operations generally consist of fee-based activity associated with transporting crude oil products on pipelines.

the system (January 1, 2017 through April 18, 2017). \nThe following is a discussion of items impacting our crude oil pipeline services segment operating margin for the periods indicated:\n \u2022 In late April 2016, as a precautionary measure we suspended service on our Mid-Continent pipeline system due to discovery of a pipeline exposure caused by heavy rains and the erosion of a riverbed in southern Oklahoma. There was no damage to the pipe and no loss of product. In the second quarter of 2016, we took action to mitigate the service suspension and worked with customers to divert volumes and, in certain circumstances, transported volumes to a third-party pipeline system via truck. In addition, the term of the throughput and deficiency agreement on our Eagle North pipeline system expired on June 30, 2016, and in July 2016 we completed a connection of the southeastern-most portion of our Mid-Continent pipeline system to our Eagle North pipeline system and concurrently reversed the Eagle North pipeline system. This enabled us to recapture diverted volumes and deliver those barrels to Cushing, Oklahoma. We are currently operating one Oklahoma mainline system, which is a combination of both the Mid-Continent and Eagle North pipeline systems, instead of two separate systems, providing us with a current capacity of approximately 20,000 to 25,000 Bpd. We are working to restore service of the second Oklahoma pipeline system and expect to put the line back in service by the end of the second quarter of 2018, increasing the transportation capacity of our pipeline systems by approximately 20,000 Bpd. The ability to fully utilize the capacity of these systems may be impacted by the market price of crude oil and producers' decisions to increase or decrease production in the areas we serve. \n \u2022 Service revenues have moved from related-party to third-party due to Ergon's acquisition of our General Partner in October 2016, at which time Vitol ceased to be a related party. \n \u2022 Included in product sales revenue for the year ended 2016 is $4.2 million in sales of crude oil arising from accumulated product-loss allowances ( PLA\u201d). Product sales revenue for 2017 included $0.3 million in PLA sales. In \naddition, as a result of one of our third-party customers utilizing a greater percentage of the capacity of our Red River pipeline, product sales revenue and cost of product sales declined from 2016 to 2017, which decreased the volume of marketed barrels of crude oil, for which revenue and costs are both recorded gross. This decrease was offset by an increase in third-party transportation revenue.\n \u2022 On April 18, 2017, we sold the East Texas pipeline system. We received cash proceeds at closing of approximately $4.8 million and recorded a gain of less than $0.1 million. The sale of the East Texas pipeline system resulted in decreased service revenues of $2.2 million for year ended 2017 as compared to 2016. \n \u2022 Operating expenses decreased for 2017 by $1.5 million compared to 2016 as a result of the sale of the East Texas pipeline system and by $0.7 million as a result of the sale of our investment in Advantage Pipeline, for which we provided operational and administrative services through August 1, 2017. Offsetting this decrease was a $0.3 million right-of-way settlement incurred in December 2017 related to the pipeline exposure described above. \n \u2022 Service revenues for 2016 decreased compared to 2015 due to the expiration of an increased tariff that was being charged from June 2014 through May 2015 on certain barrels transported on our East Texas pipeline system under a throughput and deficiency agreement. The tariff returned to a lower rate in June 2015, which decreased the service revenues generated on the East Texas pipeline system by $4.6 million compared to 2015. \n \u2022 Product sales revenues and cost of product sales for 2016 increased compared to 2015 due to our acquisition of the Red River pipeline in November 2015. In conjunction with our acquisition of the Red River pipeline, we began marketing crude oil that we purchase at production leases. Revenue from this activity is reflected in product sales revenue. In addition to the marketing revenue, we also had $4.2 million in sales of crude oil arising from accumulated product loss allowances in 2016. There were no sales of accumulated pipeline loss allowances during 2015. \n \u2022 Operating expenses for 2016 decreased compared to 2015 primarily due to decreases in maintenance and repairs. \nCrude oil trucking and producer field services\nOur crude oil trucking and producer field services segment operations generally consist of fee-based activity associated with transporting crude oil products on trucks. Revenues are generated primarily through transportation fees.\nThe following table sets forth our operating results from our crude oil trucking and producer field services segment for the periods indicated: Table 171: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Favorable/(Unfavorable)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Results\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015-2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016-2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third-party revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11,528\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(982\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Related-party revenue\n</td> <td>15,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,458\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(67\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,158\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intersegment revenue\n</td> <td>259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>244\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(473\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(53\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product sales revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third-party revenue\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intersegment revenue\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(276\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(65\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>52,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20,929\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,504\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expense (excluding depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>51,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,454\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin (excluding depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(434\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,263\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(124\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average volume (in thousands of barrels per day)\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(47\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following is a discussion of items impacting our crude oil trucking and producer field services segment operating margin for the periods indicated:\n \u2022 Service revenues and operating expenses have decreased as a result of the continued low crude oil price environment  and increased competition in the areas we serve. We continue to experience downward rate pressure in our trucking and producer field services business as producers and marketers attempt to renegotiate service rates to preserve their operating margins in the changing market.\n \u2022 Revenues have moved from related-party to third-party due to Ergon's acquisition of our General Partner in October 2016, at which time Vitol ceased to be a related party. We do not provide crude oil transportation services to Ergon. \n \u2022 Increases in product sales revenues for 2017 are the result of a crude oil sale in our field services business to a third party. Intersegment product sales revenues for all periods are the result of crude oil sales in our field services business to our crude oil pipeline services segment. \n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized total fixed asset and intangible asset impairment charges of $2.4 million related to the producer field services business. \n \u2022 During the second half of 2015, our West Texas operating margins and transported volumes were negatively impacted by increased competition from transporters and marketers quickly pipe-connecting transported barrels. As a result, we decided to cease trucking barrels in West Texas and refocus our efforts on transporting barrels around our owned crude oil pipelines and storage assets in Oklahoma and Kansas. We recorded a restructuring expense of $1.6 million related to employee severance and idle equipment costs related to our exit from the West Texas trucking business in 2015. This restructuring led to the improvement in operating margin from 2015 to 2016 despite decreased volumes and rates. \nOther Income and Expenses\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased to $31.1 million for 2017 compared to $30.8 million for 2016 and $27.2 million for 2015. These increases are primarily the result of pipeline and asphalt facility acquisitions made during the past two years.\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense was $17.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $20.0 million for 2016 and $19.0 million for 2015. The increase in expense for 2016 over 2017 and 2015 is primarily related to $1.8 million of transaction fees related to the Ergon Change of Control and acquisition-related expenses.\nAsset impairment expense. During 2017, we recorded fixed asset and intangible asset impairment expense, including an impairment of goodwill, of $2.4 million related to a write-down of our producer field services business to estimated fair value. During 2016, we recorded fixed asset impairment expense of $25.8 million, primarily due to an impairment recognized on the Knight Warrior pipeline project and the East Texas pipeline system. The Knight Warrior pipeline project was canceled due to continued low rig counts in the Eaglebine/Woodbine area coupled with lower production volumes, competing projects and the overall impact of the decreased market price of crude oil. Consequently, shipper commitments related to the project were canceled. During 2015, we recorded fixed asset impairment expenses of $12.6 million, $1.4 million, and $0.5 million related to the write-down of our East Texas pipeline system, a portion of our Mid-Continent pipeline system and our West Texas trucking stations, respectively, to their estimated fair value. In 2015, we also recorded an impairment expense of $7.5 million related to goodwill associated with our pipeline services reporting unit. We used a discounted cash flow model, supplemented by a market approach, to evaluate goodwill and the estimated fair value of assets. Key assumptions in the analysis include the use of an appropriate discount rate, volume and rate forecasts and estimates of operating costs. Due to the imprecise nature of our projections and assumptions, actual results can and often do differ from our estimates. If the assumptions used in our projections and analysis prove to be inaccurate or if the markets in which we operate experience future adverse conditions, we could incur additional impairment charges in the future.\nGain (loss) on sale of assets. Loss on sale of assets was $1.0 million in 2017 compared to gains of $0.1 million and $6.1 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. Losses for 2017 include $0.4 million related to the disposal of an asphalt tank floor that had to be replaced due to corrosion. Additional losses in 2017 were the result of sales and disposals of surplus, used property and equipment. The gain on sale of assets in 2016 consists of the sale of surplus, used property and equipment. The gain on sale of assets in 2015 includes a $6.0 million gain on the sale of crude oil pipeline linefill and storage tank bottoms related to the settlement"}
