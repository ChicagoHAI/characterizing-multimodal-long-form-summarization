Our actual results may vary materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, without limitation, those set forth in \"Risk Factors\" and the other matters set forth in this Annual Report. See \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\"\nAll references to numbered Notes are to specific footnotes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. You should read this discussion in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements, the notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Capitalized terms used, but not defined, in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") have the same meanings as in such Notes.\nOverview\nWe are principally engaged in the acquisition, ownership, development, redevelopment, management and leasing of diversified retail real estate throughout the United States. As of December 31, 2017, our portfolio consisted of approximately 39.4 million square feet of GLA, including of 230 Wholly Owned Properties totaling approximately 35.2 million square feet of GLA across 49 states and Puerto Rico, and interests in 23 JV Properties totaling over 4.2 million square feet of GLA across 13 states.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we leased space at 148 Wholly Owned Properties to Sears Holdings under the Master Lease, including 76 properties leased only to Sears Holdings and 72 properties leased to both Sears Holdings and one or more third-party tenants. The remaining 92 Wholly Owned Properties include 51 properties that are leased solely to third-party tenants and do not have any space leased to Sears Holdings, and 31 vacant properties. As of December 31, 2017, space at 22 JV Properties is also leased to Sears Holdings by, as applicable, the GGP JVs, the Simon JV or the Macerich JV, in each case under a separate JV Master Lease. Sears Holdings is the sole tenant at nine JV properties and 13 JV properties are leased to both Sears Holdings and one or more third-party tenants. One JV Property was vacant as of December 31, 2017.\nWe generate revenues primarily by leasing our properties to tenants, including both Sears Holdings and third-party tenants, who operate retail stores (and potentially other uses) in the leased premises, a business model common to many publicly traded REITs. In addition to revenues generated under the Master Lease through rent payments from Sears Holdings, we generate revenue through leases to third-party tenants under existing and future leases for space at our properties.\nThe Master Lease provides us with the right to recapture up to approximately 50% of the space occupied by Sears Holdings at the 224 Wholly Owned Properties initially included in the Master Lease (subject to certain exceptions and limitations). In addition, Seritage has the right to recapture any automotive care centers which are free-standing or attached as appendages\u201d to the properties, and all outparcels or outlots and certain portions of parking areas and common areas. Upon exercise of this recapture right, we will generally incur certain costs and expenses for the separation of the recaptured space from the remaining Sears Holdings space and can reconfigure and rent the recaptured space to third-party tenants on potentially superior terms determined by us and for our own account. We also have the right to recapture 100% of the space occupied by Sears Holdings at each of 21 identified Wholly Owned Properties by making a specified lease termination payment to Sears Holdings, after which we expect to be able to reposition and re-lease those stores on potentially superior terms determined by us and for our own account.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had exercised recapture rights at 56 properties, including 23 properties at which we exercised 100% recapture rights (seven of which were converted from partial recapture rights), 20 properties at which we exercised partial recapture rights and 13 properties at which we exercised our rights to recapture only automotive care centers or outparcels.\nWith respect to the JV Properties, each JV Master Lease provides for similar recapture rights as the Master Lease governing the Company's Wholly Owned Properties.\nOur primary objective is to create value for our shareholders through the re-leasing and redevelopment of the majority of our Wholly Owned Properties and JV Properties. In doing so, we expect to meaningfully grow NOI and diversify our tenant base while transforming our portfolio from one with a single-tenant orientation to one comprised predominately of first-class, multi-tenant shopping centers. In order to achieve our objective, we intend to execute the following strategies:\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Convert single-tenant buildings into multi-tenant properties at meaningfully higher rents;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Maximize value of vast land holdings through retail and mixed-use densification;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Leverage existing and future joint venture relationships with leading landlords and financial partners; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Maintain a flexible capital structure to support value creation activities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n- 44 -\nEffects of Natural Disasters\nThe Company assessed the impact of the natural disasters (wildfires in California and Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria) that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2017 and determined that these natural disasters did not have a material impact on our operating results or financial position. The Company did not experience interruptions in rental payments nor has it incurred material capital expenditures to repair any property damage.\nGGP Transactions\nOn July 12, 2017, the Company completed two transactions with GGP for gross consideration of $247.6 million whereby the Company (i) sold to GGP the Company's JV Interests in eight of the 12 assets in the GGP I JV for $190.1 million and recorded a gain of $43.7 million which is included in gain on sale of interest in unconsolidated joint venture within the consolidated statements of operations; and (ii) contributed five Wholly Owned Properties to the GGP II JV and sold a 50% interest in the new JV Properties to GGP for $57.5 million and recorded a gain of $11.5 million which is included in gain on sale of real estate within the consolidated statements of operations.\nAs a result of the transactions, the Company reduced amounts outstanding under its Mortgage Loans and Future Funding Facility by $50.6 million and received approximately $171.6 million of additional cash proceeds before closing costs, which it has used to fund the Company's redevelopment pipeline and for general corporate purposes.\nSimon Transaction\nOn November 3, 2017, the Company sold to Simon the its 50% JV Interests in five of the ten assets in the Simon JV for $68.0 million and recorded a gain of $16.6 million which is included in gain on sale of interest in unconsolidated joint venture within the consolidated statements of operations. Net proceeds from the sale have been used to fund the Company's redevelopment pipeline and for general corporate purposes.\nResults of Operations\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from rents received from tenants under existing leases at each of our properties. This revenue generally includes fixed base rents and recoveries of expenses that we have incurred and that we pass through to the individual tenants, in each case as provided in the respective leases.\nOur primary cash expenses consist of our property operating expenses, general and administrative expenses, interest expense and construction and development related costs. Property operating expenses include: real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, management expenses, insurance, ground lease costs and utilities; general and administrative expenses include payroll, office expenses, professional fees, and other administrative expenses; and interest expense is primarily on our mortgage loan payable. In addition, we incur substantial non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization on our properties and related intangible assets and liabilities resulting from the Transaction.\nWe did not have any revenues or expenses until we completed the Transaction on July 7, 2015.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2017 to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRental Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized total rental income of $178.5 million as compared to $186.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $7.9 million decrease was driven primarily by (i) reduced rental income under the Master Lease of $20.3 million and (ii) reduced straight-line rent of $9.2 million, offset by (i) termination fee income of $14.0 million and (ii) increased third-party rental income of $7.1 million.\nRental income attributable to Sears Holdings was $112.9 million (excluding termination fee income of $19.3 million and straight-line rental income of $0.8 million), or 73.2% of total rental income earned in the period. For the prior year period, the comparable rental income attributable to Sears Holdings was $133.2 million, or approximately 79.5% of total rental income earned in the period.\nRental income attributable to third-party tenants was $41.4 million (excluding straight-line rental income of $2.9 million), or 26.8% of total rental income earned in the period. For the prior year period, the comparable rental income attributable to third-party tenants was $34.3 million, or approximately 20.5% of total rental income earned in the period.\n- 45 -\nStraight-line rent was $3.7 million as compared to $12.9 million for the prior year period. The reduction in straight-line rent was primarily due to reduced rental income under the Master Lease and the amortization of accrued rental revenues related to the straight-line method of reporting that are deemed uncollectable as result of recapture and termination activity under the Master Lease.\nOn an annual basis, and taking into account all signed leases, including those which have not yet commenced rental payments, rental income attributable to third-party tenants would have represented approximately 52.2% of total annual base rental income as of December 31, 2017 as compared to 36.1% as of December 31, 2016.\nTenant Reimbursements and Property Operating Expenses\nPursuant to the provisions of the Master Lease and many third-party leases, the Company is entitled to be reimbursed for certain property related expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company recorded tenant reimbursement income of $62.5 million and $62.3 million, respectively, compared to property operating expenses and real estate tax expense aggregating of $65.3 million and $65.2 million, respectively.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nDepreciation and amortization expenses consist of depreciation of real property, depreciation of furniture, fixtures and equipment, and amortization of certain lease intangible assets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred depreciation and amortization expenses of $262.2 million as compared to depreciation and amortization expenses of $177.1 million in the prior year period. The increase of $85.6 million was due primarily to (i) $51.5 million of accelerated amortization attributable to certain lease intangible assets and (ii) $58.3 million of accelerated depreciation attributable to certain buildings that were demolished for redevelopment, offset by (i) $23.8 million of lower scheduled amortization and depreciation resulting from an increase in fully-amortized lease intangibles and fully-depreciated buildings and (ii) $0.5 million of lower scheduled amortization and depreciation as a result of the contribution of five Wholly Owned Properties to the GGP II JV July 2017.\nAccelerated amortization results from the recapture of space from, or the termination of space by, Sears Holdings. Such recaptures and terminations are deemed lease modifications and require related lease intangibles to be amortized over the shorter of the shortened lease term or the remaining useful life of the asset.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, professional fees, office expenses and overhead expenses.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred general and administrative expenses of $27.9 million compared to general and administrative expenses of $17.5 million for the prior year period. The $10.4 million increase was driven primarily by (i) increased compensation expense of $5.5 million related to equity awards with performance-based vesting and (ii) an increase in personnel.\nCompensation expense for equity awards with performance-based vesting is based on the fair value of the common shares at the date of the grant and is recognized, at the date the achievement of performance criteria is deemed probable, an amount equal to that which would have been recognized ratably from the date of the grant through the date the achievement of performance criteria is deemed probable, and then ratably from the date the achievement of performance criteria is deemed probable through the remainder of the vesting period.\nInterest Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred $70.1 million of interest expense (net of amounts capitalized) as compared to interest expense of $63.6 million for the prior year period. The increase in interest expense in was driven by higher average borrowings under the Future Funding Facility and Unsecured Term Loan, as well as higher average LIBOR rates.\nUnrealized Loss on Interest Rate Cap\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a loss of $0.7 million compared to a loss of less than $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n- 46 -\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2016 to the Period from July 7, 2015 (Date Operations Commenced) to December 31, 2015\nRental Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recognized total rental income of $186.4 million as compared to $86.6 million for the period from July 7, 2015 (Date Operations Commenced) to December 31, 2015. The $99.8 million increase was primarily due to additional days in the reporting period, new rents from completed redevelopments and the annual increase in base rent under the Master Lease, offset by reduced base rent under the Master Lease as a result of recapture activity initiated by the Company. In addition, the Company recorded $5.3 million of termination fee income as a result of the termination of the Master Lease at 17 properties by Sears Holdings in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nRental income attributable to Sears Holdings was $133.2 million (excluding termination fee income of $5.3 million and straight-line rental income of $9.9 million), or 79.5% of total rental income earned in the period. For the prior year period, the comparable rental income attributable to Sears Holdings was $64.8 million, or approximately 83.5% of total rental income earned in the period.\nRental income attributable to third-party tenants was $34.3 million (excluding straight-line rental income of $3.0 million), or 20.5% of total rental income earned in the period. For the prior year period, the comparable rental income attributable to third-party tenants was $12.9 million, or approximately 16.5% of total rental income earned in the period.\nStraight-line rent was $12.9 million as compared to $8.3 million for the prior year period. The increase in straight-line rent was primarily due additional days in the reporting period, offset by the amortization of accrued rental revenues related to the straight-line method of reporting that are deemed uncollectable as result of recapture and termination activity under the Master Lease.\nOn an annual basis, and taking into account all signed leases, including those which have not yet commenced rental payments, rental income attributable to third-party tenants would have represented approximately 36.1% of total annual base rental income as of December 31, 2016 as compared to 24.0% as of December 31, 2015.\nTenant Reimbursements and Property Operating Expenses\nPursuant to the provisions of the Master Lease and many third-party leases, the Company is entitled to be reimbursed for certain property related expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded tenant reimbursement income of $62.3 million, compared to property operating expenses and real estate tax expense aggregating $65.2 million. For the period from July 7, 2015 (Date Operations Commenced) to December 31, 2015, the Company recorded tenant reimbursement income of $26.9 million, compared to property operating expenses and real estate tax expense aggregating $28.7 million. The increase in both tenant reimbursement income and property operating expenses was primarily due to additional days in the reporting period.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nDepreciation and amortization expenses consist of depreciation of real property, depreciation of furniture, fixtures and equipment, and amortization of certain lease intangible assets. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company incurred depreciation and amortization expenses of $177.1 million as compared to depreciation and amortization expenses of $65.9 million for the period from July 7, 2015 (Date Operations Commenced) to December 31, 2015. The increase of $111.2 million was primarily due to additional days in the reporting period, as well as approximately $40.4 million of accelerated amortization related to certain lease intangible assets. Accelerated amortization results from the recapture of space from, or the termination of space by, Sears Holdings. Such recaptures and terminations are deemed lease modifications and require related lease intangibles to be amortized over the shorter of the shortened lease term or the remaining useful life of the asset.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, professional fees, office expenses, including information technology, and other overhead expenses.\n- 47 -\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company incurred general and administrative expenses of $17.5 million compared to general and administrative expenses of $10.0 million for the period from July 7, 2015 (Date Operations Commenced) to December 31, 2015. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to additional days in the reporting period and the hiring of additional personnel, offset by reduced up-front personnel costs related to the hiring of certain employees. The period from July 7, 2015 (Date Operations Commenced) to December 31, 2015 included $1.9 million of such up-front personnel costs.\nLitigation Charge\nIn October 2016, an agreement-in-principle was reached to settle a legal action to which we were a party, which agreement ultimately was reflected in a definitive Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement, Compromise and Release executed on February 8, 2017. The defendants, including the Company, denied the claims asserted and entered into the settlement solely to avoid the burden, expense, distraction, and inherent risk in and of litigation. The Company, having determined that a liability was both probable and estimable, recorded a charge of $19.0 million, representing the Company's share of the settlement as contemplated, during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOn May 9, 2017, the Delaware Court of Chancery entered a final order and judgment approving the settlement. Pursuant to the settlement, (a) the defendants and the D&O insurers for the individual members of the Sears Holdings' Board of Directors paid $40.0 million, of which Seritage paid $19.0 million, and (b) all defendants received customary releases.\nAcquisition-Related Expenses\nThe Company incurred acquisition-related expenses, primarily remaining legal fees, of less than $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to acquisition-related expenses of $18.4 million for the period from July 7, 2015 (Date Operations Commenced) to December 31, 2015. These costs consisted of due diligence, legal, consulting and other similar expenses related to the Transaction.\nInterest Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company incurred $63.6 million of interest expense (net of amounts capitalized) as compared to interest expense of $30.5 million for the period from July 7, 2015 (Date Operations Commenced) to December 31, 2015. Amortization of debt issuance costs was approximately $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $2.7 million for the period from July 7, 2015 (Date Operations Commenced) to December 31, 2015.\nThe increase in interest expense was driven primarily by additional days in the reporting period, as well as higher average borrowings under the Future Funding Facility and higher average LIBOR rates.\nUnrealized Loss on Interest Rate Cap\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded an unrealized loss of $1.4 million related to the change in fair value of the interest rate cap associated with its Mortgage Loan as compared to an unrealized loss of $2.9 million for the period from July 7, 2015 (Date Operations Commenced) to December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2016, the interest rate cap had a fair value of approximately $0.7 million as compared to $2.1 million at December 31, 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nProperty rental income is our primary source of cash and is dependent on a number of factors, including occupancy levels and rental rates, as well as our tenants' ability to pay rent. Our primary uses of cash include payment of operating expenses, debt service, reinvestment in and redevelopment of properties, and distributions to shareholders and unitholders. We believe that we currently have sufficient liquidity to fund such uses in the form of, as of December 31, 2017, (i) $241.6 million of unrestricted cash, (ii) $175.7 million of restricted cash, (iii) anticipated cash provided by operations and (iv) $55.0 million of permitted, but uncommitted, borrowing capacity under our Unsecured Term Loan. We may also raise additional capital through the public or private issuance of debt securities, common or preferred equity or other instruments convertible into or exchangeable for common or preferred equity, as well as through asset sales or joint ventures.\nIn November 2016, the Company and the servicer for our Mortgage Loans entered into amendments to our Loan Agreements to resolve a disagreement regarding one of the cash flow sweep provisions in our Loan Agreements. The principal terms of these amendments are that the Company has (i) posted $30.0 million, and will post $3.3 million on a monthly basis, to a redevelopment project reserve account, which amounts may be used by the Company to fund redevelopment activity and (ii) extended the spread maintenance provision for prepayment of the loan by two months through March 9, 2018 (with the spread maintenance premium for the second month at a reduced amount).\n- 48 -\nMortgage Loans Payable\nOn July 7, 2015, pursuant to the Transaction, the Company entered into a mortgage loan agreement (the Mortgage Loan Agreement\u201d) and mezzanine loan agreement (collectively, the Loan Agreements\u201d), providing for term loans in an initial principal amount of approximately $1,161 million (collectively, the Mortgage Loans\u201d) and a $100 million future funding facility (the Future Funding Facility\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreements, amounts available under the Future Funding Facility were fully drawn by the Company on June 30, 2017. Such amounts were deposited into a redevelopment reserve and will be used to fund redevelopment activity at the Company's properties.\nOn July 12, 2017, as a result of the transaction whereby the Company contributed five Wholly Owned Properties to the GGP II JV and sold a 50% interest in the new JV Properties to GGP for $57.5 million, the Company reduced amounts outstanding under its Mortgage Loans and Future Funding Facility by $50.6 million.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Mortgage Loans and the Future Funding Facility was $1,211 million.\nInterest under the Mortgage Loans and Future Funding Facility is due and payable on the payment dates, and all outstanding principal amounts are due when the loan matures on the payment date in July 2019, pursuant to the Loan Agreements. The Company has two one-year extension options subject to the payment of an extension fee and satisfaction of certain other conditions. Borrowings under the Mortgage Loans and Future Funding Facility bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rates ( LIBOR\u201d) plus, as of December 31, 2017, a weighted-average spread of 470 basis points; payments are made monthly on an interest-only basis. The weighted-average interest rates for the Mortgage Loans and Future Funding Facility for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were 6.03% and 5.24%, respectively.\nThe Loan Agreements contain a yield maintenance provision for the early extinguishment of the debt before March 9, 2018.\nThe Mortgage Loans and Future Funding Facility are secured by all of the Company's Wholly Owned Properties and a pledge of its equity in the JVs. The Loan Agreements contain customary covenants for a real estate financing, including restrictions that limit the Company's ability to grant liens on its assets, incur additional indebtedness, or transfer or sell assets, as well as those that may require the Company to obtain lender approval for certain major tenant leases or significant redevelopment projects. Such restrictions also include cash flow sweep provisions based upon certain measures of the Company's and Sears Holdings' financial and operating performance, including (a) where the Debt Yield\u201d (the ratio of net operating income for the mortgage borrowers to their debt) is less than 11.0%, (b) if the performance of Sears Holdings at the stores subject to the Master Lease with Sears Holdings fails to meet specified rent ratio thresholds, (c) if the Company fails to meet specified tenant diversification tests and (d) upon the occurrence of a bankruptcy or insolvency action with respect to Sears Holdings or if there is a payment default under the Master Lease with Sears Holdings, in each case, subject to cure rights, including providing specified amounts of cash collateral or satisfying tenant diversification thresholds.\nIn November 2016, the Company and the servicer for its Mortgage Loans entered into amendments to the Loan Agreements to resolve a disagreement regarding one of the cash flow sweep provisions in the Loan Agreements. The principal terms of these amendments are that the Company (i) posted $30.0 million, and will post $3.3 million on a monthly basis, to a redevelopment project reserve account, which amounts may be used by the Company to fund redevelopment activity and (ii) extended the spread maintenance provision for prepayment of the loan by two months through March 9, 2018 (with the spread maintenance premium for the second month at a reduced amount). As a result of this agreement and the resolution of the related disagreement, no cash flow sweep was imposed.\nAll obligations under the Loan Agreements are non-recourse to the borrowers and the pledgors of the JV Interests and the guarantors thereunder, except that (i) the borrowers and the guarantors will be liable, on a joint and several basis, for losses incurred by the lenders in respect of certain matters customary for commercial real estate loans, including misappropriation of funds and certain environmental liabilities and (ii) the indebtedness under the Loan Agreements will be fully recourse to the borrowers and guarantors upon the occurrence of certain events customary for commercial real estate loans, including without limitation prohibited transfers, prohibited voluntary liens, and bankruptcy. Additionally, the guarantors delivered a limited completion guaranty with respect to future redevelopments undertaken by the borrowers at the properties, and the Company must maintain (i) a net worth of not less than $1.0 billion and (ii) a minimum liquidity of not less than $50.0 million, throughout the term of the Loan Agreements.\nThe Company believes it is currently in compliance with all material terms and conditions of the Loan Agreements.\nThe Company incurred $22.3 million of debt issuance costs related to the Mortgage Loans and Future Funding Facility which are recorded as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the Mortgage Loans and Future Funding Facility and amortized over the term of the Loan Agreements. As of December 31, 2017, the unamortized balance of the Company's debt issuance costs was $8.2 million as compared to $14.3 million as December 31, 2016.\n- 49 -\nUnsecured Term Loan\nOn February 23, 2017, the Operating Partnership, as borrower, and the Company, as guarantor, entered into a $200 million senior unsecured delayed draw term loan facility (the Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan\u201d) with JPP, LLC and JPP II, LLC as lenders (collectively, the Original Lenders\u201d) and JPP, LLC as administrative agent.\nThe total commitment of the Lenders under the Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan was $200 million and the maturity date was December 31, 2017.\nThe principal amount of loans outstanding under the Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan bore a base annual interest rate of 6.50%. If a cash flow sweep period were to have occurred and been continuing under the Company's Mortgage Loan Agreement (i) the interest rate on any outstanding advances would have increased from and after such date by 1.5% per annum above the base interest rate and (ii) the interest rate on any advances made after such date would have increased by 3.5% per annum above the base interest rate. Accrued and unpaid interest was payable in cash, except that during the continuance of a cash flow sweep period under the Company's Mortgage Loan Agreement, the Operating Partnership could elect to defer the payment of interest which deferred amount would be added to the outstanding principal balance of the loans.\nOn February 23, 2017, the Operating Partnership paid to the Original Lenders an upfront commitment fee equal to $1.0 million. On May 24, 2017, the Operating Partnership paid to the Original Lenders an additional, and final, commitment fee of $1.0 million.\nThe Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan required that the Company at all times maintain (i) a net worth of not less than $1.0 billion, and (ii) a leverage ratio not to exceed 60.0%.\nThe Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan included customary representations and warranties, covenants and indemnities. The Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan also had customary events of default, including (subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods) payment default, failure to comply with covenants, material inaccuracy of representation or warranty, and bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. If there was an event of default, the Lenders could declare all or any portion of the outstanding indebtedness to be immediately due and payable, exercise any rights they might have under any of the Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan documents, and require the Operating Partnership to pay a default interest rate on overdue amounts equal to 1.50% in excess of the applicable base interest rate.\nMr. Edward S. Lampert, the Company's Chairman, is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ESL, which controls JPP, LLC and JPP II, LLC. The terms of the Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan were approved by the Company's Audit Committee and the Company's Board of Trustees (with Mr. Edward S. Lampert recusing himself).\nOn December 27, 2017, the Operating Partnership, as borrower, and the Company, as guarantor, refinanced the Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan with a new $200 million unsecured term loan facility (the Unsecured Term Loan\u201d). The principal amount outstanding under the Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan at termination was $85 million. No prepayment penalties were triggered and the Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan terminated in accordance with its terms.\nThe lenders under the Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan, JPP, LLC and JPP II, LLC, maintained their funding of $85 million in the Unsecured Term Loan, with JPP, LLC appointed as administrative agent under the Unsecured Term Loan. An affiliate of Empyrean Capital Partners, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (and together with JPP, LLC and JPP II LLC, each an Initial Lender\u201d and collectively, the Initial Lenders\u201d), funded $60 million under the Unsecured Term Loan, resulting in a total of $145 million committed and funded under the Unsecured Term Loan at closing. Under an accordion feature, the Company has the right to increase the total commitments up to $200 million and place an additional $55 million of incremental loans with the Initial Lenders or new lenders. The Initial Lenders under the Unsecured Term Loan are not obligated to make all or any portion of the incremental loans.\nThe Company used the proceeds of the Unsecured Term Loan, among other things, to refinance the Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan, to fund redevelopment projects and for other general corporate purposes. Loans under the Unsecured Term Loan are guaranteed by the Company.\nThe Unsecured Term Loan matures on the earlier of (i) December 31, 2018 and (ii) the date on which the outstanding indebtedness under the Company's existing mortgage and mezzanine facilities are repaid in full. The Unsecured Term Loan may be prepaid at any time in whole or in part, without any penalty or premium. Amounts drawn under the Unsecured Term Loan and repaid may not be redrawn.\nThe principal amount of loans outstanding under the Unsecured Term Loan bears a base annual interest rate of 6.75%. Accrued and unpaid interest is payable in cash.\n- 50 -\nOn December 27, 2017, the Borrower paid to each Initial Lender an upfront fee in an aggregate amount equal to 1.00% of the principal amount of the loan made by such Initial Lender.\nThe Unsecured Term Loan requires that the Company at all times maintain (i) a net worth of not less than $1.0 billion, and (ii) a leverage ratio not to exceed 60.0%.\nThe Unsecured Term Loan includes customary representations and warranties, covenants and indemnities. The Unsecured Term Loan also has customary events of default, including (subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods) payment default, failure to comply with covenants, material inaccuracy of representations or warranties, and bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. If there is an event of default, the lenders may declare all or any portion of the outstanding indebtedness to be immediately due and payable, exercise any rights they might have under any of the Unsecured Term Loan documents, and require the Borrower to pay a default interest rate on overdue amounts equal to 1.50% in excess of the then applicable interest rate.\nThe Company believes it is currently in compliance with all material terms and conditions of the Unsecured Term Loan.\nThe Company incurred $1.5 million of debt issuance costs related to the Unsecured Term Loan which are recorded as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the Unsecured Term Loan and amortized over the term of the loan. As of December 31, 2017, the unamortized balance of the Company's debt issuance costs was $1.5 million.\nMr. Edward S. Lampert, the Company's Chairman, is the sole stockholder, chief executive officer and director of ESL Investments, Inc., which controls JPP, LLC and JPP II, LLC. The terms of the Unsecured Term Loan were approved by the Company's Audit Committee and the Company's Board of Trustees (with Mr. Edward S. Lampert recusing himself).\nPreferred Shares\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had 2,800,000 7.00% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares (the Series A Preferred Shares\u201d) outstanding. We may not redeem the Series A Preferred Shares before December 14, 2022, except to preserve our status as a REIT or upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, as defined in the Trust Agreement addendums designating the Series A. On and after December 14, 2022, we may redeem any or all of the Series A Preferred Shares at $25.00 per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. In addition, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, we may redeem any or all of the Series A Preferred Share for cash within 120 days after the first date on which such Change of Control occurred at $25.00 per share plus any accrued and unpaid\nHedging Instruments\nIn connection with the issuance of the Company's Mortgage Loans and Future Funding Facility, we purchased for $5.0 million an interest rate cap with a term of four years, a notional amount of $1,261 million and a strike rate of 3.5%. Our objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements. The interest rate cap is measured at fair value and included as a component of prepaid expenses, deferred expenses and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company did not elect hedge accounting and therefore the change in fair value is included within unrealized loss on interest rate cap in the consolidated statements of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded an unrealized loss of $0.7 million related to the change in fair value of the interest rate cap as compared to an unrealized loss of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the interest rate cap had a fair value of less than $0.1 million as compared to $0.7 million on December 31, 2016.\n- 51 -\nDividends and Distributions\nThe Company's Board of Trustees has declared the following common stock dividends, with holders of Operating Partnership units entitled to an equal distribution per Operating Partnership unit held on the record date:\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Dividends per\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Class A and Class C\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Declaration Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Record Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payment Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Common Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> October 24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 11, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> July 25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September 29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> April 25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> June 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> July 13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> February 28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> April 13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> November 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 12, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> August 2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> May 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> June 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> July 14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> March 8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> April 14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe currently intend to pay quarterly dividends and distributions in cash. However, the timing, amount, and composition of all dividends and distributions will be made by the Company at the discretion of its Board of Trustees. Such dividends and distributions will depend on the financial position, results of operations, cash flows, capital requirements, debt covenants, applicable law, and other factors as the Board of Trustees of Seritage deems relevant.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company accounts for its investments in joint ventures that it does not have a controlling interest or is not the primary beneficiary using the equity method of accounting and those investments are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. As of December 31, 2017, we did not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements.\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations relate to our Mortgage Loans, Future Funding Facility, Unsecured Term Loan and non-cancelable operating leases in the form of a ground lease at one of our properties, as well as operating leases for our corporate offices.\nInformation concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts for these loan and lease agreements as of December 31, 2017 is aggregated in the following table (in thousands):\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Within\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> After\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 - 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 -5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,478,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 229,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,248,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Includes expected interest payments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures for Wholly Owned Properties under the Master Lease are generally the responsibility of the tenant.

We do not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated, or when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. In such cases, we disclose the nature of the contingency, and an estimate of the possible loss, range of loss, or disclose the fact that an estimate cannot be made.\n- 53 -\nThe Company is subject, from time to time, to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. While the resolution of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes, based on currently available information, that the final outcome of such matters will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity of the Company.\nIn May and June of 2015, four purported Sears Holdings shareholders filed lawsuits in the Delaware Court of Chancery challenging the Transaction, which lawsuits were subsequently consolidated into a single action captioned In re Sears Holdings Corporation Stockholder and Derivative Litigation, Consol. C.A. No. 11081-VCL (the Action\u201d). On October 15, 2015, plaintiffs filed a verified consolidated stockholder derivative complaint in the Action against the individual members of Sears Holdings' Board of Directors, ESL Investments, Inc. (together with its affiliates, ESL\u201d), Sears Holdings' CEO, Fairholme Capital Management L.L.C. ( FCM\u201d), and Seritage. On July 12, 2016, the plaintiffs filed a verified consolidated amended stockholder derivative complaint (the Amended Complaint\u201d) against the same defendants and asserting substantially the same claims as set forth in the complaint filed in October 2015. The plaintiffs brought the Action derivatively on behalf of Sears Holdings, which was named as a nominal defendant, and alleged that the Sears Holdings directors, as well as ESL and Edwards S. Lampert (in their capacity as the alleged controlling stockholder of Sears Holdings), breached their fiduciary duties to Sears Holdings shareholders by selling the Wholly Owned Properties to Seritage at a price that was unfairly low and was the result of a process that allegedly was flawed. The Amended Complaint also alleged that Seritage and FCM aided and abetted these alleged fiduciary breaches. Among other forms of relief, the Amended Complaint sought damages in unspecified amounts. In October 2016, following mediation, the parties reached an agreement-in-principle to settle the Action, which ultimately was reflected in a definitive Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement, Compromise and Release executed on February 8, 2017. On May 9, 2017, the Delaware Court of Chancery, after customary notice to Sears Holding stockholders and an in-person settlement hearing, entered a final order and judgment approving the settlement. Pursuant to the settlement, (a) the defendants and the D&O insurers for the individual members of the Sears Holdings' Board of Directors paid $40.0 million, of which Seritage paid $19.0 million and (b) all defendants received customary releases. The defendants continue to deny the claims asserted and entered into the settlement solely to avoid the burden, expense, distraction, and inherent risk in and of litigation.\n- 54 -\nRetenanting and Redevelopment Projects\nWe are currently retenanting or redeveloping several properties primarily to convert single-tenant buildings occupied by Sears Holdings into multi-tenant properties occupied by a diversity of retailers and related concepts. The table below provides a brief description of each of the 63 new redevelopment projects originated on the Seritage platform as of December 31, 2017. These projects represent an estimated total investment of approximately $1,066.9 million, of which approximately $801.7 million remained to be spent.\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td> Total Project Costs under $10 Million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Estimated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Estimated\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Project\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Construction\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Substantial\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Property\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Square Feet\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Start\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Completion\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> King of Prussia, PA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Repurpose former auto center space for Outback Steakhouse, Yard House and small shop retail\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Substantially complete\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Merrillville, IN\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Termination property; redevelop existing store for At Home, Powerhouse Gym and small shop retail\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 132,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Substantially complete\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Elkhart, IN\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Termination property; existing store has been released to Big R Stores\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 86,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Substantially complete\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> San Antonio, TX\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Recapture and repurpose auto center space for Orvis, Jared's Jeweler, Shake Shack and small shop retail\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Substantially complete\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bowie, MD\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Recapture and repurpose auto center space for BJ's Brewhouse\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Substantially complete\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Troy, MI\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Partial recapture; redevelop existing store for At Home\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Substantially complete\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Roseville, MI\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Partial recapture; redevelop existing store for At Home\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Substantially complete\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Henderson, NV\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Termination property; redevelop existing store for At Home, Seafood City and additional retail\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 144,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Substantially complete\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rehoboth Beach, DE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Partial recapture; redevelop existing store for Christmas Tree Shops andThat! and PetSmart\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Substantially complete\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cullman, AL\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Termination property; redevelop existing store for Bargain Hunt, Tractor Supply and Planet Fitness\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 99,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Substantially complete\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Jefferson City, MO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Termination property; redevelop existing store for Orscheln Farm and Home\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 96,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Delivered to tenant\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Albany, NY\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Recapture and repurpose auto center space for BJ's Brewhouse and additional small shop retail\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Delivered to tenant\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hagerstown, MD\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Recapture and repurpose auto center space for BJ's Brewhouse, Verizon and additional restaurants\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Delivered to tenant\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ft.

Investment returns are dependent on the success of the leasing and development plans in place for each project, as well as the successful completion of each project. Investment returns are subject to a number of variables, risks, and uncertainties including those disclosed within Item 1A of our Annual Report. We also refer you to our disclosure related to forward-looking statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, we have made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in Note 2 to the audited consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.\n- 57 -\nAccounting for Real Estate Acquisitions\nUpon the acquisition of real estate, the Company assesses the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities assumed, including land, buildings, improvements and identified intangibles such as above-market and below-market leases, in-place leases and other items, as applicable, and allocates the purchase price based on these assessments. In making estimates of fair values, the Company may use a number of sources, including data provided by third parties, as well as information obtained by the Company as a result of its due diligence, including expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located.\nThe fair values of tangible assets are determined on an \"if vacant\" basis. The \"if vacant\" fair value allocated to land is generally estimated via a market or sales comparison approach with the subject site being compared to similar properties that have sold or are currently listed for sale. The comparable properties are adjusted for dissimilar characteristics such as market conditions, location, access/frontage, size, shape/topography, or intended use, including the impact of any encumbrances on such use. The \"if vacant\" value allocated to buildings and site improvements is generally estimated using an income approach and a cost approach that utilizes published guidelines for current replacement cost or actual construction costs for similar, recently developed properties. Assumptions used in the income approach include capitalization and discount rates, lease-up time, market rents, make ready costs, land value, and site improvement value.\nThe estimated fair value of in-place tenant leases includes lease origination costs (the costs the Company would have incurred to lease the property to the current occupancy level) and the lost revenues during the period necessary to lease-up from vacant to the current occupancy level. Such estimates include the fair value of leasing commissions, legal costs and tenant coordination costs that would be incurred to lease the property to this occupancy level. Additionally, the Company evaluates the time period over which such occupancy level would be achieved and include an estimate of the net operating costs (primarily real estate taxes, insurance and utilities) incurred during the lease-up period, which generally ranges up to one year. The fair value of acquired in-place tenant leases is included in lease intangible assets on the consolidated balance sheets and amortized over the remaining lease term for each tenant.\nIdentifiable intangible assets and liabilities are calculated for above-market and below-market tenant and ground leases where the Company is either the lessor or the lessee. The difference between the contractual rental rates and the Company's estimate of market rental rates is measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the leases, including significantly below-market renewal options for which exercise of the renewal option appears to be reasonably assured. Above-market tenant leases and below-market ground leases are included in lease intangible assets on the consolidated balance sheets and below-market tenant leases are included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nReal Estate Investments\nReal estate assets are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization.\nExpenditures for ordinary repairs and maintenance will be expensed as incurred. Significant renovations which improve the property or extend the useful life of the assets are capitalized. As real estate is undergoing redevelopment activities, all amounts directly associated with and attributable to the project, including planning, development and construction costs, interest costs, personnel costs of employees directly involved and other miscellaneous costs incurred during the period of redevelopment, are capitalized. The capitalization period begins when redevelopment activities are underway and ends when the project is substantially complete.\nDepreciation of real estate assets, excluding land, is recognized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives which generally range from five to 40 years. Tenant improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful life or non-cancelable term of lease.\nWe amortize identified intangibles that have finite lives over the period they are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the property or business acquired, generally the remaining non-cancelable term of a related lease.\nOn a periodic basis, management assesses whether there are indicators that the value of the Company's real estate assets (including any related intangible assets or liabilities) may be impaired. If an indicator is identified, a real estate asset is considered impaired only if management's estimate of current and projected operating cash flows (undiscounted and unleveraged), taking into account the anticipated and probability weighted holding period, are less than a real estate asset's carrying value. Various factors are considered in the estimation process, including expected future operating income, trends and prospects and the effects of demand, competition, and other economic factors. If management determines that the carrying value of a real estate asset is impaired, a loss will be recorded for the excess of its carrying amount over its estimated fair value.\n- 58 -\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\nThe Company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures using the equity method of accounting. These investments are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently adjusted for cash contributions, cash distributions and earnings which are recognized in accordance with the terms of the applicable agreement.\nTo determine the method of accounting for partially owned joint ventures, we evaluate the characteristics of associated entities and determine whether an entity is a variable interest entity (\"VIE\") and, if so, determine which party is primary beneficiary by analyzing whether we have both the power to direct the entity's significant economic activities and the obligation to absorb potentially significant losses or receive potentially significant benefits. We will consolidate a VIE if we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary.\nOn a periodic basis, management assesses whether there are indicators, including the operating performance of the underlying real estate and general market conditions, that the value of the Company's investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired. An investment's value is impaired only if management's estimate of the fair value of the Company's investment is less than its carrying value and such difference is deemed to be other-than-temporary. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value.\nRevenue Recognition\nRental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable terms of the related leases. For leases that have fixed and measurable rent escalations, the difference between such rental income earned and the cash rent due under the provisions of the lease is recorded as deferred rent receivable and included as a component of tenant and other receivables on the consolidated balance sheets.\nIn leasing tenant space, we may provide funding to the lessee through a tenant allowance. In accounting for a tenant allowance, we will determine whether the allowance represents funding for the construction of leasehold improvements and evaluate the ownership of such improvements. If we are considered the owner of the improvements for accounting purposes, we capitalize the amount of the tenant allowance and depreciate it over the shorter of the useful life of the improvements or the related lease term. If the tenant allowance represents a payment for a purpose other than funding leasehold improvements, or in the event we are not considered the owner of the improvements for accounting purposes, the allowance is considered to be a lease incentive and is recognized over the lease term as reduction of rental revenue on straight-line basis.\nAccounting for Recapture and Termination Activity Pursuant to the Master Lease\nWe generally treat recapture and termination activity pursuant to the Master Lease as modifications of the Master Lease as of the date of notice. Such notices and lease modifications result in the following accounting adjustments for the recaptured or terminated property:\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Accrued rental revenues related to the straight-line method of reporting rental revenue that are deemed uncollectable as a result of the lease modification are amortized over the remaining shortened life of the lease from the date of notice to the date of vacancy.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Intangible lease assets and liabilities that are deemed to be impacted by the lease modification are amortized over the shorter of (i) the shortened life of the lease from the date of notice to the date of vacancy or (ii) the remaining useful life of the asset or liability.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdditionally, termination fees paid by us to Sears Holding, if any, in connection with a 100% recapture notice are generally capitalized as either an initial direct cost of obtaining a new lease or a necessary cost of the real estate project and depreciated over the life of the new lease obtained or the real estate asset being constructed or improved.\nTermination fees required to be paid by Sears Holdings to us in connection with a lease termination by Sears Holdings are recognized, for the portion of the termination fee attributable to the annual base rent of the subject property, on a straight-line basis over the shortened life of the lease from the date the termination fee becomes legally binding to the date of vacancy and, for the portion of the termination fee attributable to estimated real estate taxes and property operating expenses for the subject property, unearned tenant reimbursement income is recorded in the period such fee is received and recognized as tenant reimbursement revenue in the same periods as the expenses are incurred.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently issued accounting pronouncements.\n- 59 -\nNon-GAAP Supplemental Financial Measures and Definitions\nThe Company makes reference to NOI, Total NOI, FFO, Company FFO, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA which are considered non-GAAP measures.\nNet Operating Income (\"NOI\") and Total NOI\nWe define NOI as income from property operations less property operating expenses. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating NOI, and accordingly, the Company's depiction of NOI may not be comparable to other REITs. We believe NOI provides useful information regarding the Company, its financial condition, and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level.\nThe Company also uses Total NOI, which includes its proportional share of unconsolidated properties. We believe this form of presentation offers insights into the financial performance and condition of the Company as a whole given our ownership of unconsolidated properties that are accounted for under GAAP using the equity method. We also consider Total NOI to be a helpful supplemental measure of our operating performance because it excludes from NOI variable items such as termination fee income, as well as non-cash items such as straight-line rent and amortization of lease intangibles.\nDue to the adjustments noted, NOI and Total NOI should only be used as an alternative measure of the Company's financial performance.\nEarnings Before Interest Expense, Income Tax, Depreciation, and Amortization (\"EBITDA\") and Adjusted EBITDA\nWe define EBITDA as net income less depreciation, amortization, interest expense and provision for income and other taxes. EBITDA is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries, but may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies. We believe EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it removes the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). Management also believes the use of EBITDA facilitates comparisons between us and other equity REITs, retail property owners who are not REITs, and other capital-intensive companies.\nThe Company makes certain adjustments to EBITDA, which it refers to as Adjusted EBITDA, to account for certain non-cash and non-comparable items, such as termination fee income, unrealized loss on interest rate cap, litigation charges, acquisition-related expenses, up-front-hiring and personnel costs and gains (or losses) from property sales, that it does not believe are representative of ongoing operating results.\nDue to the adjustments noted, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should only be used as an alternative measure of the Company's financial performance\nFunds From Operations (\"FFO\") and Company FFO\nWe define FFO using the definition set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"), which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies who do not use the NAREIT definition of FFO. FFO is calculated as net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from property sales, real estate related depreciation and amortization, and impairment charges on depreciable real estate assets.\nWe consider FFO a helpful supplemental measure of the operating performance for equity REITs and a complement to GAAP measures because it is a recognized measure of performance by the real estate industry. FFO facilitates an understanding of the operating performance of our properties between periods because it does not give effect to real estate depreciation and amortization which are calculated to allocate the cost of a property over its useful life. Since values for well-maintained real estate assets have historically increased or decreased based upon prevailing market conditions, the Company believes that FFO provides investors with a clearer view of the Company's operating performance.\nThe Company makes certain adjustments to FFO, which it refers to as Company FFO, to account for certain non-cash and non-comparable items, such as termination fee income, unrealized loss on interest rate cap, litigations charges, acquisition-related expenses, amortization of deferred financing costs and up-front-hiring and personnel costs, that it does not believe are representative of ongoing operating results. The Company previously referred to this metric as Normalized FFO; the definition and calculation remain the same.\nDue to the adjustments noted, FFO and Company FFO should only be used as an alternative measure of the Company's financial performance.\n- 60 -\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Financial Measures\nNone of NOI, Total NOI, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and Company FFO are measures that (i) represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP; (ii) are indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs, including the ability to make distributions; (iii) are alternatives to cash flow as a measure of liquidity; or (iv) should be considered alternatives to net income (which is determined in accordance with GAAP) for purposes of evaluating the Company's operating performance. Reconciliations of these measures to the respective GAAP measures we deem most comparable are presented below on a comparative basis for all periods.\nThe following table reconciles NOI and Total NOI to GAAP net loss for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017, and for the period from July 7, 2015 (Date Operations Commenced) through December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 153:

Our actual results may vary materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, without limitation, those set forth in \"Risk Factors\" and the other matters set forth in this Annual Report. See \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\"\nAll references to numbered Notes are to specific footnotes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. You should read this discussion in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements, the notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Capitalized terms used, but not defined, in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") have the same meanings as in such Notes.\nOverview\nWe are principally engaged in the acquisition, ownership, development, redevelopment, management and leasing of diversified retail real estate throughout the United States. As of December 31, 2017, our portfolio consisted of approximately 39.4 million square feet of GLA, including of 230 Wholly Owned Properties totaling approximately 35.2 million square feet of GLA across 49 states and Puerto Rico, and interests in 23 JV Properties totaling over 4.2 million square feet of GLA across 13 states.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we leased space at 148 Wholly Owned Properties to Sears Holdings under the Master Lease, including 76 properties leased only to Sears Holdings and 72 properties leased to both Sears Holdings and one or more third-party tenants. The remaining 92 Wholly Owned Properties include 51 properties that are leased solely to third-party tenants and do not have any space leased to Sears Holdings, and 31 vacant properties. As of December 31, 2017, space at 22 JV Properties is also leased to Sears Holdings by, as applicable, the GGP JVs, the Simon JV or the Macerich JV, in each case under a separate JV Master Lease. Sears Holdings is the sole tenant at nine JV properties and 13 JV properties are leased to both Sears Holdings and one or more third-party tenants. One JV Property was vacant as of December 31, 2017.\nWe generate revenues primarily by leasing our properties to tenants, including both Sears Holdings and third-party tenants, who operate retail stores (and potentially other uses) in the leased premises, a business model common to many publicly traded REITs. In addition to revenues generated under the Master Lease through rent payments from Sears Holdings, we generate revenue through leases to third-party tenants under existing and future leases for space at our properties.\nThe Master Lease provides us with the right to recapture up to approximately 50% of the space occupied by Sears Holdings at the 224 Wholly Owned Properties initially included in the Master Lease (subject to certain exceptions and limitations). In addition, Seritage has the right to recapture any automotive care centers which are free-standing or attached as appendages\u201d to the properties, and all outparcels or outlots and certain portions of parking areas and common areas. Upon exercise of this recapture right, we will generally incur certain costs and expenses for the separation of the recaptured space from the remaining Sears Holdings space and can reconfigure and rent the recaptured space to third-party tenants on potentially superior terms determined by us and for our own account. We also have the right to recapture 100% of the space occupied by Sears Holdings at each of 21 identified Wholly Owned Properties by making a specified lease termination payment to Sears Holdings, after which we expect to be able to reposition and re-lease those stores on potentially superior terms determined by us and for our own account.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had exercised recapture rights at 56 properties, including 23 properties at which we exercised 100% recapture rights (seven of which were converted from partial recapture rights), 20 properties at which we exercised partial recapture rights and 13 properties at which we exercised our rights to recapture only automotive care centers or outparcels.\nWith respect to the JV Properties, each JV Master Lease provides for similar recapture rights as the Master Lease governing the Company's Wholly Owned Properties.\nOur primary objective is to create value for our shareholders through the re-leasing and redevelopment of the majority of our Wholly Owned Properties and JV Properties. In doing so, we expect to meaningfully grow NOI and diversify our tenant base while transforming our portfolio from one with a single-tenant orientation to one comprised predominately of first-class, multi-tenant shopping centers. In order to achieve our objective, we intend to execute the following strategies:\n \u2022 Convert single-tenant buildings into multi-tenant properties at meaningfully higher rents; \n \u2022 Maximize value of vast land holdings through retail and mixed-use densification; \n \u2022 Leverage existing and future joint venture relationships with leading landlords and financial partners; and \n \u2022 Maintain a flexible capital structure to support value creation activities. \n- 44 -\nEffects of Natural Disasters\nThe Company assessed the impact of the natural disasters (wildfires in California and Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria) that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2017 and determined that these natural disasters did not have a material impact on our operating results or financial position. The Company did not experience interruptions in rental payments nor has it incurred material capital expenditures to repair any property damage.\nGGP Transactions\nOn July 12, 2017, the Company completed two transactions with GGP for gross consideration of $247.6 million whereby the Company (i) sold to GGP the Company's JV Interests in eight of the 12 assets in the GGP I JV for $190.1 million and recorded a gain of $43.7 million which is included in gain on sale of interest in unconsolidated joint venture within the consolidated statements of operations; and (ii) contributed five Wholly Owned Properties to the GGP II JV and sold a 50% interest in the new JV Properties to GGP for $57.5 million and recorded a gain of $11.5 million which is included in gain on sale of real estate within the consolidated statements of operations.\nAs a result of the transactions, the Company reduced amounts outstanding under its Mortgage Loans and Future Funding Facility by $50.6 million and received approximately $171.6 million of additional cash proceeds before closing costs, which it has used to fund the Company's redevelopment pipeline and for general corporate purposes.\nSimon Transaction\nOn November 3, 2017, the Company sold to Simon the its 50% JV Interests in five of the ten assets in the Simon JV for $68.0 million and recorded a gain of $16.6 million which is included in gain on sale of interest in unconsolidated joint venture within the consolidated statements of operations. Net proceeds from the sale have been used to fund the Company's redevelopment pipeline and for general corporate purposes.\nResults of Operations\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from rents received from tenants under existing leases at each of our properties. This revenue generally includes fixed base rents and recoveries of expenses that we have incurred and that we pass through to the individual tenants, in each case as provided in the respective leases.\nOur primary cash expenses consist of our property operating expenses, general and administrative expenses, interest expense and construction and development related costs. Property operating expenses include: real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, management expenses, insurance, ground lease costs and utilities; general and administrative expenses include payroll, office expenses, professional fees, and other administrative expenses; and interest expense is primarily on our mortgage loan payable. In addition, we incur substantial non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization on our properties and related intangible assets and liabilities resulting from the Transaction.\nWe did not have any revenues or expenses until we completed the Transaction on July 7, 2015.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2017 to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRental Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized total rental income of $178.5 million as compared to $186.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $7.9 million decrease was driven primarily by (i) reduced rental income under the Master Lease of $20.3 million and (ii) reduced straight-line rent of $9.2 million, offset by (i) termination fee income of $14.0 million and (ii) increased third-party rental income of $7.1 million.\nRental income attributable to Sears Holdings was $112.9 million (excluding termination fee income of $19.3 million and straight-line rental income of $0.8 million), or 73.2% of total rental income earned in the period. For the prior year period, the comparable rental income attributable to Sears Holdings was $133.2 million, or approximately 79.5% of total rental income earned in the period.\nRental income attributable to third-party tenants was $41.4 million (excluding straight-line rental income of $2.9 million), or 26.8% of total rental income earned in the period. For the prior year period, the comparable rental income attributable to third-party tenants was $34.3 million, or approximately 20.5% of total rental income earned in the period.\n- 45 -\nStraight-line rent was $3.7 million as compared to $12.9 million for the prior year period. The reduction in straight-line rent was primarily due to reduced rental income under the Master Lease and the amortization of accrued rental revenues related to the straight-line method of reporting that are deemed uncollectable as result of recapture and termination activity under the Master Lease.\nOn an annual basis, and taking into account all signed leases, including those which have not yet commenced rental payments, rental income attributable to third-party tenants would have represented approximately 52.2% of total annual base rental income as of December 31, 2017 as compared to 36.1% as of December 31, 2016.\nTenant Reimbursements and Property Operating Expenses\nPursuant to the provisions of the Master Lease and many third-party leases, the Company is entitled to be reimbursed for certain property related expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company recorded tenant reimbursement income of $62.5 million and $62.3 million, respectively, compared to property operating expenses and real estate tax expense aggregating of $65.3 million and $65.2 million, respectively.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nDepreciation and amortization expenses consist of depreciation of real property, depreciation of furniture, fixtures and equipment, and amortization of certain lease intangible assets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred depreciation and amortization expenses of $262.2 million as compared to depreciation and amortization expenses of $177.1 million in the prior year period. The increase of $85.6 million was due primarily to (i) $51.5 million of accelerated amortization attributable to certain lease intangible assets and (ii) $58.3 million of accelerated depreciation attributable to certain buildings that were demolished for redevelopment, offset by (i) $23.8 million of lower scheduled amortization and depreciation resulting from an increase in fully-amortized lease intangibles and fully-depreciated buildings and (ii) $0.5 million of lower scheduled amortization and depreciation as a result of the contribution of five Wholly Owned Properties to the GGP II JV July 2017.\nAccelerated amortization results from the recapture of space from, or the termination of space by, Sears Holdings. Such recaptures and terminations are deemed lease modifications and require related lease intangibles to be amortized over the shorter of the shortened lease term or the remaining useful life of the asset.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, professional fees, office expenses and overhead expenses.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred general and administrative expenses of $27.9 million compared to general and administrative expenses of $17.5 million for the prior year period. The $10.4 million increase was driven primarily by (i) increased compensation expense of $5.5 million related to equity awards with performance-based vesting and (ii) an increase in personnel.\nCompensation expense for equity awards with performance-based vesting is based on the fair value of the common shares at the date of the grant and is recognized, at the date the achievement of performance criteria is deemed probable, an amount equal to that which would have been recognized ratably from the date of the grant through the date the achievement of performance criteria is deemed probable, and then ratably from the date the achievement of performance criteria is deemed probable through the remainder of the vesting period.\nInterest Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred $70.1 million of interest expense (net of amounts capitalized) as compared to interest expense of $63.6 million for the prior year period. The increase in interest expense in was driven by higher average borrowings under the Future Funding Facility and Unsecured Term Loan, as well as higher average LIBOR rates.\nUnrealized Loss on Interest Rate Cap\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a loss of $0.7 million compared to a loss of less than $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n- 46 -\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2016 to the Period from July 7, 2015 (Date Operations Commenced) to December 31, 2015\nRental Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recognized total rental income of $186.4 million as compared to $86.6 million for the period from July 7, 2015 (Date Operations Commenced) to December 31, 2015. The $99.8 million increase was primarily due to additional days in the reporting period, new rents from completed redevelopments and the annual increase in base rent under the Master Lease, offset by reduced base rent under the Master Lease as a result of recapture activity initiated by the Company. In addition, the Company recorded $5.3 million of termination fee income as a result of the termination of the Master Lease at 17 properties by Sears Holdings in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nRental income attributable to Sears Holdings was $133.2 million (excluding termination fee income of $5.3 million and straight-line rental income of $9.9 million), or 79.5% of total rental income earned in the period. For the prior year period, the comparable rental income attributable to Sears Holdings was $64.8 million, or approximately 83.5% of total rental income earned in the period.\nRental income attributable to third-party tenants was $34.3 million (excluding straight-line rental income of $3.0 million), or 20.5% of total rental income earned in the period. For the prior year period, the comparable rental income attributable to third-party tenants was $12.9 million, or approximately 16.5% of total rental income earned in the period.\nStraight-line rent was $12.9 million as compared to $8.3 million for the prior year period. The increase in straight-line rent was primarily due additional days in the reporting period, offset by the amortization of accrued rental revenues related to the straight-line method of reporting that are deemed uncollectable as result of recapture and termination activity under the Master Lease.\nOn an annual basis, and taking into account all signed leases, including those which have not yet commenced rental payments, rental income attributable to third-party tenants would have represented approximately 36.1% of total annual base rental income as of December 31, 2016 as compared to 24.0% as of December 31, 2015.\nTenant Reimbursements and Property Operating Expenses\nPursuant to the provisions of the Master Lease and many third-party leases, the Company is entitled to be reimbursed for certain property related expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded tenant reimbursement income of $62.3 million, compared to property operating expenses and real estate tax expense aggregating $65.2 million. For the period from July 7, 2015 (Date Operations Commenced) to December 31, 2015, the Company recorded tenant reimbursement income of $26.9 million, compared to property operating expenses and real estate tax expense aggregating $28.7 million. The increase in both tenant reimbursement income and property operating expenses was primarily due to additional days in the reporting period.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nDepreciation and amortization expenses consist of depreciation of real property, depreciation of furniture, fixtures and equipment, and amortization of certain lease intangible assets. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company incurred depreciation and amortization expenses of $177.1 million as compared to depreciation and amortization expenses of $65.9 million for the period from July 7, 2015 (Date Operations Commenced) to December 31, 2015. The increase of $111.2 million was primarily due to additional days in the reporting period, as well as approximately $40.4 million of accelerated amortization related to certain lease intangible assets. Accelerated amortization results from the recapture of space from, or the termination of space by, Sears Holdings. Such recaptures and terminations are deemed lease modifications and require related lease intangibles to be amortized over the shorter of the shortened lease term or the remaining useful life of the asset.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, professional fees, office expenses, including information technology, and other overhead expenses.\n- 47 -\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company incurred general and administrative expenses of $17.5 million compared to general and administrative expenses of $10.0 million for the period from July 7, 2015 (Date Operations Commenced) to December 31, 2015. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to additional days in the reporting period and the hiring of additional personnel, offset by reduced up-front personnel costs related to the hiring of certain employees. The period from July 7, 2015 (Date Operations Commenced) to December 31, 2015 included $1.9 million of such up-front personnel costs.\nLitigation Charge\nIn October 2016, an agreement-in-principle was reached to settle a legal action to which we were a party, which agreement ultimately was reflected in a definitive Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement, Compromise and Release executed on February 8, 2017. The defendants, including the Company, denied the claims asserted and entered into the settlement solely to avoid the burden, expense, distraction, and inherent risk in and of litigation. The Company, having determined that a liability was both probable and estimable, recorded a charge of $19.0 million, representing the Company's share of the settlement as contemplated, during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOn May 9, 2017, the Delaware Court of Chancery entered a final order and judgment approving the settlement. Pursuant to the settlement, (a) the defendants and the D&O insurers for the individual members of the Sears Holdings' Board of Directors paid $40.0 million, of which Seritage paid $19.0 million, and (b) all defendants received customary releases.\nAcquisition-Related Expenses\nThe Company incurred acquisition-related expenses, primarily remaining legal fees, of less than $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to acquisition-related expenses of $18.4 million for the period from July 7, 2015 (Date Operations Commenced) to December 31, 2015. These costs consisted of due diligence, legal, consulting and other similar expenses related to the Transaction.\nInterest Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company incurred $63.6 million of interest expense (net of amounts capitalized) as compared to interest expense of $30.5 million for the period from July 7, 2015 (Date Operations Commenced) to December 31, 2015. Amortization of debt issuance costs was approximately $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $2.7 million for the period from July 7, 2015 (Date Operations Commenced) to December 31, 2015.\nThe increase in interest expense was driven primarily by additional days in the reporting period, as well as higher average borrowings under the Future Funding Facility and higher average LIBOR rates.\nUnrealized Loss on Interest Rate Cap\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded an unrealized loss of $1.4 million related to the change in fair value of the interest rate cap associated with its Mortgage Loan as compared to an unrealized loss of $2.9 million for the period from July 7, 2015 (Date Operations Commenced) to December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2016, the interest rate cap had a fair value of approximately $0.7 million as compared to $2.1 million at December 31, 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nProperty rental income is our primary source of cash and is dependent on a number of factors, including occupancy levels and rental rates, as well as our tenants' ability to pay rent. Our primary uses of cash include payment of operating expenses, debt service, reinvestment in and redevelopment of properties, and distributions to shareholders and unitholders. We believe that we currently have sufficient liquidity to fund such uses in the form of, as of December 31, 2017, (i) $241.6 million of unrestricted cash, (ii) $175.7 million of restricted cash, (iii) anticipated cash provided by operations and (iv) $55.0 million of permitted, but uncommitted, borrowing capacity under our Unsecured Term Loan. We may also raise additional capital through the public or private issuance of debt securities, common or preferred equity or other instruments convertible into or exchangeable for common or preferred equity, as well as through asset sales or joint ventures.\nIn November 2016, the Company and the servicer for our Mortgage Loans entered into amendments to our Loan Agreements to resolve a disagreement regarding one of the cash flow sweep provisions in our Loan Agreements. The principal terms of these amendments are that the Company has (i) posted $30.0 million, and will post $3.3 million on a monthly basis, to a redevelopment project reserve account, which amounts may be used by the Company to fund redevelopment activity and (ii) extended the spread maintenance provision for prepayment of the loan by two months through March 9, 2018 (with the spread maintenance premium for the second month at a reduced amount).\n- 48 -\nMortgage Loans Payable\nOn July 7, 2015, pursuant to the Transaction, the Company entered into a mortgage loan agreement (the Mortgage Loan Agreement\u201d) and mezzanine loan agreement (collectively, the Loan Agreements\u201d), providing for term loans in an initial principal amount of approximately $1,161 million (collectively, the Mortgage Loans\u201d) and a $100 million future funding facility (the Future Funding Facility\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreements, amounts available under the Future Funding Facility were fully drawn by the Company on June 30, 2017. Such amounts were deposited into a redevelopment reserve and will be used to fund redevelopment activity at the Company's properties.\nOn July 12, 2017, as a result of the transaction whereby the Company contributed five Wholly Owned Properties to the GGP II JV and sold a 50% interest in the new JV Properties to GGP for $57.5 million, the Company reduced amounts outstanding under its Mortgage Loans and Future Funding Facility by $50.6 million.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Mortgage Loans and the Future Funding Facility was $1,211 million.\nInterest under the Mortgage Loans and Future Funding Facility is due and payable on the payment dates, and all outstanding principal amounts are due when the loan matures on the payment date in July 2019, pursuant to the Loan Agreements. The Company has two one-year extension options subject to the payment of an extension fee and satisfaction of certain other conditions. Borrowings under the Mortgage Loans and Future Funding Facility bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rates ( LIBOR\u201d) plus, as of December 31, 2017, a weighted-average spread of 470 basis points; payments are made monthly on an interest-only basis. The weighted-average interest rates for the Mortgage Loans and Future Funding Facility for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were 6.03% and 5.24%, respectively.\nThe Loan Agreements contain a yield maintenance provision for the early extinguishment of the debt before March 9, 2018.\nThe Mortgage Loans and Future Funding Facility are secured by all of the Company's Wholly Owned Properties and a pledge of its equity in the JVs. The Loan Agreements contain customary covenants for a real estate financing, including restrictions that limit the Company's ability to grant liens on its assets, incur additional indebtedness, or transfer or sell assets, as well as those that may require the Company to obtain lender approval for certain major tenant leases or significant redevelopment projects. Such restrictions also include cash flow sweep provisions based upon certain measures of the Company's and Sears Holdings' financial and operating performance, including (a) where the Debt Yield\u201d (the ratio of net operating income for the mortgage borrowers to their debt) is less than 11.0%, (b) if the performance of Sears Holdings at the stores subject to the Master Lease with Sears Holdings fails to meet specified rent ratio thresholds, (c) if the Company fails to meet specified tenant diversification tests and (d) upon the occurrence of a bankruptcy or insolvency action with respect to Sears Holdings or if there is a payment default under the Master Lease with Sears Holdings, in each case, subject to cure rights, including providing specified amounts of cash collateral or satisfying tenant diversification thresholds.\nIn November 2016, the Company and the servicer for its Mortgage Loans entered into amendments to the Loan Agreements to resolve a disagreement regarding one of the cash flow sweep provisions in the Loan Agreements. The principal terms of these amendments are that the Company (i) posted $30.0 million, and will post $3.3 million on a monthly basis, to a redevelopment project reserve account, which amounts may be used by the Company to fund redevelopment activity and (ii) extended the spread maintenance provision for prepayment of the loan by two months through March 9, 2018 (with the spread maintenance premium for the second month at a reduced amount). As a result of this agreement and the resolution of the related disagreement, no cash flow sweep was imposed.\nAll obligations under the Loan Agreements are non-recourse to the borrowers and the pledgors of the JV Interests and the guarantors thereunder, except that (i) the borrowers and the guarantors will be liable, on a joint and several basis, for losses incurred by the lenders in respect of certain matters customary for commercial real estate loans, including misappropriation of funds and certain environmental liabilities and (ii) the indebtedness under the Loan Agreements will be fully recourse to the borrowers and guarantors upon the occurrence of certain events customary for commercial real estate loans, including without limitation prohibited transfers, prohibited voluntary liens, and bankruptcy. Additionally, the guarantors delivered a limited completion guaranty with respect to future redevelopments undertaken by the borrowers at the properties, and the Company must maintain (i) a net worth of not less than $1.0 billion and (ii) a minimum liquidity of not less than $50.0 million, throughout the term of the Loan Agreements.\nThe Company believes it is currently in compliance with all material terms and conditions of the Loan Agreements.\nThe Company incurred $22.3 million of debt issuance costs related to the Mortgage Loans and Future Funding Facility which are recorded as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the Mortgage Loans and Future Funding Facility and amortized over the term of the Loan Agreements. As of December 31, 2017, the unamortized balance of the Company's debt issuance costs was $8.2 million as compared to $14.3 million as December 31, 2016.\n- 49 -\nUnsecured Term Loan\nOn February 23, 2017, the Operating Partnership, as borrower, and the Company, as guarantor, entered into a $200 million senior unsecured delayed draw term loan facility (the Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan\u201d) with JPP, LLC and JPP II, LLC as lenders (collectively, the Original Lenders\u201d) and JPP, LLC as administrative agent.\nThe total commitment of the Lenders under the Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan was $200 million and the maturity date was December 31, 2017.\nThe principal amount of loans outstanding under the Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan bore a base annual interest rate of 6.50%. If a cash flow sweep period were to have occurred and been continuing under the Company's Mortgage Loan Agreement (i) the interest rate on any outstanding advances would have increased from and after such date by 1.5% per annum above the base interest rate and (ii) the interest rate on any advances made after such date would have increased by 3.5% per annum above the base interest rate. Accrued and unpaid interest was payable in cash, except that during the continuance of a cash flow sweep period under the Company's Mortgage Loan Agreement, the Operating Partnership could elect to defer the payment of interest which deferred amount would be added to the outstanding principal balance of the loans.\nOn February 23, 2017, the Operating Partnership paid to the Original Lenders an upfront commitment fee equal to $1.0 million. On May 24, 2017, the Operating Partnership paid to the Original Lenders an additional, and final, commitment fee of $1.0 million.\nThe Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan required that the Company at all times maintain (i) a net worth of not less than $1.0 billion, and (ii) a leverage ratio not to exceed 60.0%.\nThe Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan included customary representations and warranties, covenants and indemnities. The Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan also had customary events of default, including (subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods) payment default, failure to comply with covenants, material inaccuracy of representation or warranty, and bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. If there was an event of default, the Lenders could declare all or any portion of the outstanding indebtedness to be immediately due and payable, exercise any rights they might have under any of the Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan documents, and require the Operating Partnership to pay a default interest rate on overdue amounts equal to 1.50% in excess of the applicable base interest rate.\nMr. Edward S. Lampert, the Company's Chairman, is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ESL, which controls JPP, LLC and JPP II, LLC. The terms of the Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan were approved by the Company's Audit Committee and the Company's Board of Trustees (with Mr. Edward S. Lampert recusing himself).\nOn December 27, 2017, the Operating Partnership, as borrower, and the Company, as guarantor, refinanced the Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan with a new $200 million unsecured term loan facility (the Unsecured Term Loan\u201d). The principal amount outstanding under the Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan at termination was $85 million. No prepayment penalties were triggered and the Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan terminated in accordance with its terms.\nThe lenders under the Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan, JPP, LLC and JPP II, LLC, maintained their funding of $85 million in the Unsecured Term Loan, with JPP, LLC appointed as administrative agent under the Unsecured Term Loan. An affiliate of Empyrean Capital Partners, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (and together with JPP, LLC and JPP II LLC, each an Initial Lender\u201d and collectively, the Initial Lenders\u201d), funded $60 million under the Unsecured Term Loan, resulting in a total of $145 million committed and funded under the Unsecured Term Loan at closing. Under an accordion feature, the Company has the right to increase the total commitments up to $200 million and place an additional $55 million of incremental loans with the Initial Lenders or new lenders. The Initial Lenders under the Unsecured Term Loan are not obligated to make all or any portion of the incremental loans.\nThe Company used the proceeds of the Unsecured Term Loan, among other things, to refinance the Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan, to fund redevelopment projects and for other general corporate purposes. Loans under the Unsecured Term Loan are guaranteed by the Company.\nThe Unsecured Term Loan matures on the earlier of (i) December 31, 2018 and (ii) the date on which the outstanding indebtedness under the Company's existing mortgage and mezzanine facilities are repaid in full. The Unsecured Term Loan may be prepaid at any time in whole or in part, without any penalty or premium. Amounts drawn under the Unsecured Term Loan and repaid may not be redrawn.\nThe principal amount of loans outstanding under the Unsecured Term Loan bears a base annual interest rate of 6.75%. Accrued and unpaid interest is payable in cash.\n- 50 -\nOn December 27, 2017, the Borrower paid to each Initial Lender an upfront fee in an aggregate amount equal to 1.00% of the principal amount of the loan made by such Initial Lender.\nThe Unsecured Term Loan requires that the Company at all times maintain (i) a net worth of not less than $1.0 billion, and (ii) a leverage ratio not to exceed 60.0%.\nThe Unsecured Term Loan includes customary representations and warranties, covenants and indemnities. The Unsecured Term Loan also has customary events of default, including (subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods) payment default, failure to comply with covenants, material inaccuracy of representations or warranties, and bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. If there is an event of default, the lenders may declare all or any portion of the outstanding indebtedness to be immediately due and payable, exercise any rights they might have under any of the Unsecured Term Loan documents, and require the Borrower to pay a default interest rate on overdue amounts equal to 1.50% in excess of the then applicable interest rate.\nThe Company believes it is currently in compliance with all material terms and conditions of the Unsecured Term Loan.\nThe Company incurred $1.5 million of debt issuance costs related to the Unsecured Term Loan which are recorded as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the Unsecured Term Loan and amortized over the term of the loan. As of December 31, 2017, the unamortized balance of the Company's debt issuance costs was $1.5 million.\nMr. Edward S. Lampert, the Company's Chairman, is the sole stockholder, chief executive officer and director of ESL Investments, Inc., which controls JPP, LLC and JPP II, LLC. The terms of the Unsecured Term Loan were approved by the Company's Audit Committee and the Company's Board of Trustees (with Mr. Edward S. Lampert recusing himself).\nPreferred Shares\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had 2,800,000 7.00% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares (the Series A Preferred Shares\u201d) outstanding. We may not redeem the Series A Preferred Shares before December 14, 2022, except to preserve our status as a REIT or upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, as defined in the Trust Agreement addendums designating the Series A. On and after December 14, 2022, we may redeem any or all of the Series A Preferred Shares at $25.00 per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. In addition, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, we may redeem any or all of the Series A Preferred Share for cash within 120 days after the first date on which such Change of Control occurred at $25.00 per share plus any accrued and unpaid\nHedging Instruments\nIn connection with the issuance of the Company's Mortgage Loans and Future Funding Facility, we purchased for $5.0 million an interest rate cap with a term of four years, a notional amount of $1,261 million and a strike rate of 3.5%. Our objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements. The interest rate cap is measured at fair value and included as a component of prepaid expenses, deferred expenses and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company did not elect hedge accounting and therefore the change in fair value is included within unrealized loss on interest rate cap in the consolidated statements of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded an unrealized loss of $0.7 million related to the change in fair value of the interest rate cap as compared to an unrealized loss of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the interest rate cap had a fair value of less than $0.1 million as compared to $0.7 million on December 31, 2016.\n- 51 -\nDividends and Distributions\nThe Company's Board of Trustees has declared the following common stock dividends, with holders of Operating Partnership units entitled to an equal distribution per Operating Partnership unit held on the record date:\n\nWe currently intend to pay quarterly dividends and distributions in cash. However, the timing, amount, and composition of all dividends and distributions will be made by the Company at the discretion of its Board of Trustees. Such dividends and distributions will depend on the financial position, results of operations, cash flows, capital requirements, debt covenants, applicable law, and other factors as the Board of Trustees of Seritage deems relevant.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company accounts for its investments in joint ventures that it does not have a controlling interest or is not the primary beneficiary using the equity method of accounting and those investments are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. As of December 31, 2017, we did not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements.\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations relate to our Mortgage Loans, Future Funding Facility, Unsecured Term Loan and non-cancelable operating leases in the form of a ground lease at one of our properties, as well as operating leases for our corporate offices.\nInformation concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts for these loan and lease agreements as of December 31, 2017 is aggregated in the following table (in thousands):\n\n (1) Includes expected interest payments. \nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures for Wholly Owned Properties under the Master Lease are generally the responsibility of the tenant. Given that the majority of our GLA is subject to the Master Lease as of December 31, 2017, we do not currently anticipate incurring material expenses related to maintenance capital expenditures, tenant improvement costs or leasing commissions, outside of those associated with retenanting and redevelopment projects as described below.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred maintenance capital expenditures of approximately $0.5 million and tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions of $2.0 million and $0.3 million, respectively, that were not associated with retenanting and redevelopment projects.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred maintenance capital expenditures of approximately $0.5 million and tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions of $1.3 million and $0.1 million, respectively, that were not associated with retenanting and redevelopment projects.\n- 52 -\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $69.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $110.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Significant changes in the components of net cash provided by operating activities include:\n \u2212 In 2017, a decrease in operating cash inflows of $19.0 million due the payment of a previously recorded litigation expense; and \n \u2212 In 2017, a decrease in operating cash inflows due to net reductions in rental income under the Master Lease, increased general and administrative expense and increased interest expense, offset by increased termination fee income and additional third-party rental income. \nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to net cash used by investing activities of $75.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Significant components of net cash provided by and used in investing activities include:\n \u2212 In 2017, proceeds from the sale of real estate and JV Interests, $308.2 million; \n \u2212 In 2017, development of real estate and property improvements, ($243.1) million; \n \u2212 In 2017, investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, ($38.0) million; \n \u2212 In 2016, development of real estate and property improvements, ($66.2) million; and \n \u2212 In 2016, investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, ($9.0) million. \nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $180.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to net cash used in financing activities of $50.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Significant components of net cash provided by and used in financings activities include:\n \u2212 In 2017, proceeds from the Future Funding Facility, $80.0 million; \n \u2212 In 2017, proceeds from the Unsecured Term Loan, $145.0 million; \n \u2212 In 2017, net proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock, $66.5 million; \n \u2212 In 2017, repayment of mortgage loan payables, ($50.6) million; \n \u2212 In 2017, cash distributions to common stockholders and holders of Operating Partnership units, ($55.7) million; \n \u2212 In 2016, proceeds from the Future Funding Facility, $20.0 million; and \n \u2212 In 2016, cash distributions to common stockholders and holders of Operating Partnership units, ($69.6) million. \nLitigation and Other Matters\nIn accordance with accounting standards regarding loss contingencies, the Company accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, and we disclose the amount accrued and the amount of a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued or disclose the fact that such a range of loss cannot be estimated. We do not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated, or when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. In such cases, we disclose the nature of the contingency, and an estimate of the possible loss, range of loss, or disclose the fact that an estimate cannot be made.\n- 53 -\nThe Company is subject, from time to time, to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. While the resolution of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes, based on currently available information, that the final outcome of such matters will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity of the Company.\nIn May and June of 2015, four purported Sears Holdings shareholders filed lawsuits in the Delaware Court of Chancery challenging the Transaction, which lawsuits were subsequently consolidated into a single action captioned In re Sears Holdings Corporation Stockholder and Derivative Litigation, Consol. C.A. No. 11081-VCL (the Action\u201d). On October 15, 2015, plaintiffs filed a verified consolidated stockholder derivative complaint in the Action against the individual members of Sears Holdings' Board of Directors, ESL Investments, Inc. (together with its affiliates, ESL\u201d), Sears Holdings' CEO, Fairholme Capital Management L.L.C. ( FCM\u201d), and Seritage. On July 12, 2016, the plaintiffs filed a verified consolidated amended stockholder derivative complaint (the Amended Complaint\u201d) against the same defendants and asserting substantially the same claims as set forth in the complaint filed in October 2015. The plaintiffs brought the Action derivatively on behalf of Sears Holdings, which was named as a nominal defendant, and alleged that the Sears Holdings directors, as well as ESL and Edwards S. Lampert (in their capacity as the alleged controlling stockholder of Sears Holdings), breached their fiduciary duties to Sears Holdings shareholders by selling the Wholly Owned Properties to Seritage at a price that was unfairly low and was the result of a process that allegedly was flawed. The Amended Complaint also alleged that Seritage and FCM aided and abetted these alleged fiduciary breaches. Among other forms of relief, the Amended Complaint sought damages in unspecified amounts. In October 2016, following mediation, the parties reached an agreement-in-principle to settle the Action, which ultimately was reflected in a definitive Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement, Compromise and Release executed on February 8, 2017. On May 9, 2017, the Delaware Court of Chancery, after customary notice to Sears Holding stockholders and an in-person settlement hearing, entered a final order and judgment approving the settlement. Pursuant to the settlement, (a) the defendants and the D&O insurers for the individual members of the Sears Holdings' Board of Directors paid $40.0 million, of which Seritage paid $19.0 million and (b) all defendants received customary releases. The defendants continue to deny the claims asserted and entered into the settlement solely to avoid the burden, expense, distraction, and inherent risk in and of litigation.\n- 54 -\nRetenanting and Redevelopment Projects\nWe are currently retenanting or redeveloping several properties primarily to convert single-tenant buildings occupied by Sears Holdings into multi-tenant properties occupied by a diversity of retailers and related concepts. The table below provides a brief description of each of the 63 new redevelopment projects originated on the Seritage platform as of December 31, 2017. These projects represent an estimated total investment of approximately $1,066.9 million, of which approximately $801.7 million remained to be spent.\n\n \n- 55 -\n\n (1) Excludes Saugus, MA project which has been temporarily postponed while the Company identifies a new lead tenant.

Our actual results may vary materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, without limitation, those set forth in \"Risk Factors\" and the other matters set forth in this Annual Report. See \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\"\nAll references to numbered Notes are to specific footnotes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. You should read this discussion in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements, the notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Capitalized terms used, but not defined, in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") have the same meanings as in such Notes.\nOverview\nWe are principally engaged in the acquisition, ownership, development, redevelopment, management and leasing of diversified retail real estate throughout the United States. As of December 31, 2017, our portfolio consisted of approximately 39.4 million square feet of GLA, including of 230 Wholly Owned Properties totaling approximately 35.2 million square feet of GLA across 49 states and Puerto Rico, and interests in 23 JV Properties totaling over 4.2 million square feet of GLA across 13 states.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we leased space at 148 Wholly Owned Properties to Sears Holdings under the Master Lease, including 76 properties leased only to Sears Holdings and 72 properties leased to both Sears Holdings and one or more third-party tenants. The remaining 92 Wholly Owned Properties include 51 properties that are leased solely to third-party tenants and do not have any space leased to Sears Holdings, and 31 vacant properties. As of December 31, 2017, space at 22 JV Properties is also leased to Sears Holdings by, as applicable, the GGP JVs, the Simon JV or the Macerich JV, in each case under a separate JV Master Lease. Sears Holdings is the sole tenant at nine JV properties and 13 JV properties are leased to both Sears Holdings and one or more third-party tenants. One JV Property was vacant as of December 31, 2017.\nWe generate revenues primarily by leasing our properties to tenants, including both Sears Holdings and third-party tenants, who operate retail stores (and potentially other uses) in the leased premises, a business model common to many publicly traded REITs. In addition to revenues generated under the Master Lease through rent payments from Sears Holdings, we generate revenue through leases to third-party tenants under existing and future leases for space at our properties.\nThe Master Lease provides us with the right to recapture up to approximately 50% of the space occupied by Sears Holdings at the 224 Wholly Owned Properties initially included in the Master Lease (subject to certain exceptions and limitations). In addition, Seritage has the right to recapture any automotive care centers which are free-standing or attached as appendages\u201d to the properties, and all outparcels or outlots and certain portions of parking areas and common areas. Upon exercise of this recapture right, we will generally incur certain costs and expenses for the separation of the recaptured space from the remaining Sears Holdings space and can reconfigure and rent the recaptured space to third-party tenants on potentially superior terms determined by us and for our own account. We also have the right to recapture 100% of the space occupied by Sears Holdings at each of 21 identified Wholly Owned Properties by making a specified lease termination payment to Sears Holdings, after which we expect to be able to reposition and re-lease those stores on potentially superior terms determined by us and for our own account.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had exercised recapture rights at 56 properties, including 23 properties at which we exercised 100% recapture rights (seven of which were converted from partial recapture rights), 20 properties at which we exercised partial recapture rights and 13 properties at which we exercised our rights to recapture only automotive care centers or outparcels.\nWith respect to the JV Properties, each JV Master Lease provides for similar recapture rights as the Master Lease governing the Company's Wholly Owned Properties.\nOur primary objective is to create value for our shareholders through the re-leasing and redevelopment of the majority of our Wholly Owned Properties and JV Properties. In doing so, we expect to meaningfully grow NOI and diversify our tenant base while transforming our portfolio from one with a single-tenant orientation to one comprised predominately of first-class, multi-tenant shopping centers. In order to achieve our objective, we intend to execute the following strategies:\n \u2022 Convert single-tenant buildings into multi-tenant properties at meaningfully higher rents; \n \u2022 Maximize value of vast land holdings through retail and mixed-use densification; \n \u2022 Leverage existing and future joint venture relationships with leading landlords and financial partners; and \n \u2022 Maintain a flexible capital structure to support value creation activities. \n- 44 -\nEffects of Natural Disasters\nThe Company assessed the impact of the natural disasters (wildfires in California and Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria) that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2017 and determined that these natural disasters did not have a material impact on our operating results or financial position. The Company did not experience interruptions in rental payments nor has it incurred material capital expenditures to repair any property damage.\nGGP Transactions\nOn July 12, 2017, the Company completed two transactions with GGP for gross consideration of $247.6 million whereby the Company (i) sold to GGP the Company's JV Interests in eight of the 12 assets in the GGP I JV for $190.1 million and recorded a gain of $43.7 million which is included in gain on sale of interest in unconsolidated joint venture within the consolidated statements of operations; and (ii) contributed five Wholly Owned Properties to the GGP II JV and sold a 50% interest in the new JV Properties to GGP for $57.5 million and recorded a gain of $11.5 million which is included in gain on sale of real estate within the consolidated statements of operations.\nAs a result of the transactions, the Company reduced amounts outstanding under its Mortgage Loans and Future Funding Facility by $50.6 million and received approximately $171.6 million of additional cash proceeds before closing costs, which it has used to fund the Company's redevelopment pipeline and for general corporate purposes.\nSimon Transaction\nOn November 3, 2017, the Company sold to Simon the its 50% JV Interests in five of the ten assets in the Simon JV for $68.0 million and recorded a gain of $16.6 million which is included in gain on sale of interest in unconsolidated joint venture within the consolidated statements of operations. Net proceeds from the sale have been used to fund the Company's redevelopment pipeline and for general corporate purposes.\nResults of Operations\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from rents received from tenants under existing leases at each of our properties. This revenue generally includes fixed base rents and recoveries of expenses that we have incurred and that we pass through to the individual tenants, in each case as provided in the respective leases.\nOur primary cash expenses consist of our property operating expenses, general and administrative expenses, interest expense and construction and development related costs. Property operating expenses include: real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, management expenses, insurance, ground lease costs and utilities; general and administrative expenses include payroll, office expenses, professional fees, and other administrative expenses; and interest expense is primarily on our mortgage loan payable. In addition, we incur substantial non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization on our properties and related intangible assets and liabilities resulting from the Transaction.\nWe did not have any revenues or expenses until we completed the Transaction on July 7, 2015.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2017 to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRental Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized total rental income of $178.5 million as compared to $186.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $7.9 million decrease was driven primarily by (i) reduced rental income under the Master Lease of $20.3 million and (ii) reduced straight-line rent of $9.2 million, offset by (i) termination fee income of $14.0 million and (ii) increased third-party rental income of $7.1 million.\nRental income attributable to Sears Holdings was $112.9 million (excluding termination fee income of $19.3 million and straight-line rental income of $0.8 million), or 73.2% of total rental income earned in the period. For the prior year period, the comparable rental income attributable to Sears Holdings was $133.2 million, or approximately 79.5% of total rental income earned in the period.\nRental income attributable to third-party tenants was $41.4 million (excluding straight-line rental income of $2.9 million), or 26.8% of total rental income earned in the period. For the prior year period, the comparable rental income attributable to third-party tenants was $34.3 million, or approximately 20.5% of total rental income earned in the period.\n- 45 -\nStraight-line rent was $3.7 million as compared to $12.9 million for the prior year period. The reduction in straight-line rent was primarily due to reduced rental income under the Master Lease and the amortization of accrued rental revenues related to the straight-line method of reporting that are deemed uncollectable as result of recapture and termination activity under the Master Lease.\nOn an annual basis, and taking into account all signed leases, including those which have not yet commenced rental payments, rental income attributable to third-party tenants would have represented approximately 52.2% of total annual base rental income as of December 31, 2017 as compared to 36.1% as of December 31, 2016.\nTenant Reimbursements and Property Operating Expenses\nPursuant to the provisions of the Master Lease and many third-party leases, the Company is entitled to be reimbursed for certain property related expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company recorded tenant reimbursement income of $62.5 million and $62.3 million, respectively, compared to property operating expenses and real estate tax expense aggregating of $65.3 million and $65.2 million, respectively.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nDepreciation and amortization expenses consist of depreciation of real property, depreciation of furniture, fixtures and equipment, and amortization of certain lease intangible assets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred depreciation and amortization expenses of $262.2 million as compared to depreciation and amortization expenses of $177.1 million in the prior year period. The increase of $85.6 million was due primarily to (i) $51.5 million of accelerated amortization attributable to certain lease intangible assets and (ii) $58.3 million of accelerated depreciation attributable to certain buildings that were demolished for redevelopment, offset by (i) $23.8 million of lower scheduled amortization and depreciation resulting from an increase in fully-amortized lease intangibles and fully-depreciated buildings and (ii) $0.5 million of lower scheduled amortization and depreciation as a result of the contribution of five Wholly Owned Properties to the GGP II JV July 2017.\nAccelerated amortization results from the recapture of space from, or the termination of space by, Sears Holdings. Such recaptures and terminations are deemed lease modifications and require related lease intangibles to be amortized over the shorter of the shortened lease term or the remaining useful life of the asset.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, professional fees, office expenses and overhead expenses.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred general and administrative expenses of $27.9 million compared to general and administrative expenses of $17.5 million for the prior year period. The $10.4 million increase was driven primarily by (i) increased compensation expense of $5.5 million related to equity awards with performance-based vesting and (ii) an increase in personnel.\nCompensation expense for equity awards with performance-based vesting is based on the fair value of the common shares at the date of the grant and is recognized, at the date the achievement of performance criteria is deemed probable, an amount equal to that which would have been recognized ratably from the date of the grant through the date the achievement of performance criteria is deemed probable, and then ratably from the date the achievement of performance criteria is deemed probable through the remainder of the vesting period.\nInterest Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred $70.1 million of interest expense (net of amounts capitalized) as compared to interest expense of $63.6 million for the prior year period. The increase in interest expense in was driven by higher average borrowings under the Future Funding Facility and Unsecured Term Loan, as well as higher average LIBOR rates.\nUnrealized Loss on Interest Rate Cap\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a loss of $0.7 million compared to a loss of less than $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n- 46 -\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2016 to the Period from July 7, 2015 (Date Operations Commenced) to December 31, 2015\nRental Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recognized total rental income of $186.4 million as compared to $86.6 million for the period from July 7, 2015 (Date Operations Commenced) to December 31, 2015. The $99.8 million increase was primarily due to additional days in the reporting period, new rents from completed redevelopments and the annual increase in base rent under the Master Lease, offset by reduced base rent under the Master Lease as a result of recapture activity initiated by the Company. In addition, the Company recorded $5.3 million of termination fee income as a result of the termination of the Master Lease at 17 properties by Sears Holdings in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nRental income attributable to Sears Holdings was $133.2 million (excluding termination fee income of $5.3 million and straight-line rental income of $9.9 million), or 79.5% of total rental income earned in the period. For the prior year period, the comparable rental income attributable to Sears Holdings was $64.8 million, or approximately 83.5% of total rental income earned in the period.\nRental income attributable to third-party tenants was $34.3 million (excluding straight-line rental income of $3.0 million), or 20.5% of total rental income earned in the period. For the prior year period, the comparable rental income attributable to third-party tenants was $12.9 million, or approximately 16.5% of total rental income earned in the period.\nStraight-line rent was $12.9 million as compared to $8.3 million for the prior year period. The increase in straight-line rent was primarily due additional days in the reporting period, offset by the amortization of accrued rental revenues related to the straight-line method of reporting that are deemed uncollectable as result of recapture and termination activity under the Master Lease.\nOn an annual basis, and taking into account all signed leases, including those which have not yet commenced rental payments, rental income attributable to third-party tenants would have represented approximately 36.1% of total annual base rental income as of December 31, 2016 as compared to 24.0% as of December 31, 2015.\nTenant Reimbursements and Property Operating Expenses\nPursuant to the provisions of the Master Lease and many third-party leases, the Company is entitled to be reimbursed for certain property related expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded tenant reimbursement income of $62.3 million, compared to property operating expenses and real estate tax expense aggregating $65.2 million. For the period from July 7, 2015 (Date Operations Commenced) to December 31, 2015, the Company recorded tenant reimbursement income of $26.9 million, compared to property operating expenses and real estate tax expense aggregating $28.7 million. The increase in both tenant reimbursement income and property operating expenses was primarily due to additional days in the reporting period.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nDepreciation and amortization expenses consist of depreciation of real property, depreciation of furniture, fixtures and equipment, and amortization of certain lease intangible assets. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company incurred depreciation and amortization expenses of $177.1 million as compared to depreciation and amortization expenses of $65.9 million for the period from July 7, 2015 (Date Operations Commenced) to December 31, 2015. The increase of $111.2 million was primarily due to additional days in the reporting period, as well as approximately $40.4 million of accelerated amortization related to certain lease intangible assets. Accelerated amortization results from the recapture of space from, or the termination of space by, Sears Holdings. Such recaptures and terminations are deemed lease modifications and require related lease intangibles to be amortized over the shorter of the shortened lease term or the remaining useful life of the asset.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, professional fees, office expenses, including information technology, and other overhead expenses.\n- 47 -\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company incurred general and administrative expenses of $17.5 million compared to general and administrative expenses of $10.0 million for the period from July 7, 2015 (Date Operations Commenced) to December 31, 2015. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to additional days in the reporting period and the hiring of additional personnel, offset by reduced up-front personnel costs related to the hiring of certain employees. The period from July 7, 2015 (Date Operations Commenced) to December 31, 2015 included $1.9 million of such up-front personnel costs.\nLitigation Charge\nIn October 2016, an agreement-in-principle was reached to settle a legal action to which we were a party, which agreement ultimately was reflected in a definitive Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement, Compromise and Release executed on February 8, 2017. The defendants, including the Company, denied the claims asserted and entered into the settlement solely to avoid the burden, expense, distraction, and inherent risk in and of litigation. The Company, having determined that a liability was both probable and estimable, recorded a charge of $19.0 million, representing the Company's share of the settlement as contemplated, during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOn May 9, 2017, the Delaware Court of Chancery entered a final order and judgment approving the settlement. Pursuant to the settlement, (a) the defendants and the D&O insurers for the individual members of the Sears Holdings' Board of Directors paid $40.0 million, of which Seritage paid $19.0 million, and (b) all defendants received customary releases.\nAcquisition-Related Expenses\nThe Company incurred acquisition-related expenses, primarily remaining legal fees, of less than $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to acquisition-related expenses of $18.4 million for the period from July 7, 2015 (Date Operations Commenced) to December 31, 2015. These costs consisted of due diligence, legal, consulting and other similar expenses related to the Transaction.\nInterest Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company incurred $63.6 million of interest expense (net of amounts capitalized) as compared to interest expense of $30.5 million for the period from July 7, 2015 (Date Operations Commenced) to December 31, 2015. Amortization of debt issuance costs was approximately $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $2.7 million for the period from July 7, 2015 (Date Operations Commenced) to December 31, 2015.\nThe increase in interest expense was driven primarily by additional days in the reporting period, as well as higher average borrowings under the Future Funding Facility and higher average LIBOR rates.\nUnrealized Loss on Interest Rate Cap\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded an unrealized loss of $1.4 million related to the change in fair value of the interest rate cap associated with its Mortgage Loan as compared to an unrealized loss of $2.9 million for the period from July 7, 2015 (Date Operations Commenced) to December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2016, the interest rate cap had a fair value of approximately $0.7 million as compared to $2.1 million at December 31, 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nProperty rental income is our primary source of cash and is dependent on a number of factors, including occupancy levels and rental rates, as well as our tenants' ability to pay rent. Our primary uses of cash include payment of operating expenses, debt service, reinvestment in and redevelopment of properties, and distributions to shareholders and unitholders. We believe that we currently have sufficient liquidity to fund such uses in the form of, as of December 31, 2017, (i) $241.6 million of unrestricted cash, (ii) $175.7 million of restricted cash, (iii) anticipated cash provided by operations and (iv) $55.0 million of permitted, but uncommitted, borrowing capacity under our Unsecured Term Loan. We may also raise additional capital through the public or private issuance of debt securities, common or preferred equity or other instruments convertible into or exchangeable for common or preferred equity, as well as through asset sales or joint ventures.\nIn November 2016, the Company and the servicer for our Mortgage Loans entered into amendments to our Loan Agreements to resolve a disagreement regarding one of the cash flow sweep provisions in our Loan Agreements. The principal terms of these amendments are that the Company has (i) posted $30.0 million, and will post $3.3 million on a monthly basis, to a redevelopment project reserve account, which amounts may be used by the Company to fund redevelopment activity and (ii) extended the spread maintenance provision for prepayment of the loan by two months through March 9, 2018 (with the spread maintenance premium for the second month at a reduced amount).\n- 48 -\nMortgage Loans Payable\nOn July 7, 2015, pursuant to the Transaction, the Company entered into a mortgage loan agreement (the Mortgage Loan Agreement\u201d) and mezzanine loan agreement (collectively, the Loan Agreements\u201d), providing for term loans in an initial principal amount of approximately $1,161 million (collectively, the Mortgage Loans\u201d) and a $100 million future funding facility (the Future Funding Facility\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreements, amounts available under the Future Funding Facility were fully drawn by the Company on June 30, 2017. Such amounts were deposited into a redevelopment reserve and will be used to fund redevelopment activity at the Company's properties.\nOn July 12, 2017, as a result of the transaction whereby the Company contributed five Wholly Owned Properties to the GGP II JV and sold a 50% interest in the new JV Properties to GGP for $57.5 million, the Company reduced amounts outstanding under its Mortgage Loans and Future Funding Facility by $50.6 million.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Mortgage Loans and the Future Funding Facility was $1,211 million.\nInterest under the Mortgage Loans and Future Funding Facility is due and payable on the payment dates, and all outstanding principal amounts are due when the loan matures on the payment date in July 2019, pursuant to the Loan Agreements. The Company has two one-year extension options subject to the payment of an extension fee and satisfaction of certain other conditions. Borrowings under the Mortgage Loans and Future Funding Facility bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rates ( LIBOR\u201d) plus, as of December 31, 2017, a weighted-average spread of 470 basis points; payments are made monthly on an interest-only basis. The weighted-average interest rates for the Mortgage Loans and Future Funding Facility for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were 6.03% and 5.24%, respectively.\nThe Loan Agreements contain a yield maintenance provision for the early extinguishment of the debt before March 9, 2018.\nThe Mortgage Loans and Future Funding Facility are secured by all of the Company's Wholly Owned Properties and a pledge of its equity in the JVs. The Loan Agreements contain customary covenants for a real estate financing, including restrictions that limit the Company's ability to grant liens on its assets, incur additional indebtedness, or transfer or sell assets, as well as those that may require the Company to obtain lender approval for certain major tenant leases or significant redevelopment projects. Such restrictions also include cash flow sweep provisions based upon certain measures of the Company's and Sears Holdings' financial and operating performance, including (a) where the Debt Yield\u201d (the ratio of net operating income for the mortgage borrowers to their debt) is less than 11.0%, (b) if the performance of Sears Holdings at the stores subject to the Master Lease with Sears Holdings fails to meet specified rent ratio thresholds, (c) if the Company fails to meet specified tenant diversification tests and (d) upon the occurrence of a bankruptcy or insolvency action with respect to Sears Holdings or if there is a payment default under the Master Lease with Sears Holdings, in each case, subject to cure rights, including providing specified amounts of cash collateral or satisfying tenant diversification thresholds.\nIn November 2016, the Company and the servicer for its Mortgage Loans entered into amendments to the Loan Agreements to resolve a disagreement regarding one of the cash flow sweep provisions in the Loan Agreements. The principal terms of these amendments are that the Company (i) posted $30.0 million, and will post $3.3 million on a monthly basis, to a redevelopment project reserve account, which amounts may be used by the Company to fund redevelopment activity and (ii) extended the spread maintenance provision for prepayment of the loan by two months through March 9, 2018 (with the spread maintenance premium for the second month at a reduced amount). As a result of this agreement and the resolution of the related disagreement, no cash flow sweep was imposed.\nAll obligations under the Loan Agreements are non-recourse to the borrowers and the pledgors of the JV Interests and the guarantors thereunder, except that (i) the borrowers and the guarantors will be liable, on a joint and several basis, for losses incurred by the lenders in respect of certain matters customary for commercial real estate loans, including misappropriation of funds and certain environmental liabilities and (ii) the indebtedness under the Loan Agreements will be fully recourse to the borrowers and guarantors upon the occurrence of certain events customary for commercial real estate loans, including without limitation prohibited transfers, prohibited voluntary liens, and bankruptcy. Additionally, the guarantors delivered a limited completion guaranty with respect to future redevelopments undertaken by the borrowers at the properties, and the Company must maintain (i) a net worth of not less than $1.0 billion and (ii) a minimum liquidity of not less than $50.0 million, throughout the term of the Loan Agreements.\nThe Company believes it is currently in compliance with all material terms and conditions of the Loan Agreements.\nThe Company incurred $22.3 million of debt issuance costs related to the Mortgage Loans and Future Funding Facility which are recorded as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the Mortgage Loans and Future Funding Facility and amortized over the term of the Loan Agreements. As of December 31, 2017, the unamortized balance of the Company's debt issuance costs was $8.2 million as compared to $14.3 million as December 31, 2016.\n- 49 -\nUnsecured Term Loan\nOn February 23, 2017, the Operating Partnership, as borrower, and the Company, as guarantor, entered into a $200 million senior unsecured delayed draw term loan facility (the Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan\u201d) with JPP, LLC and JPP II, LLC as lenders (collectively, the Original Lenders\u201d) and JPP, LLC as administrative agent.\nThe total commitment of the Lenders under the Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan was $200 million and the maturity date was December 31, 2017.\nThe principal amount of loans outstanding under the Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan bore a base annual interest rate of 6.50%. If a cash flow sweep period were to have occurred and been continuing under the Company's Mortgage Loan Agreement (i) the interest rate on any outstanding advances would have increased from and after such date by 1.5% per annum above the base interest rate and (ii) the interest rate on any advances made after such date would have increased by 3.5% per annum above the base interest rate. Accrued and unpaid interest was payable in cash, except that during the continuance of a cash flow sweep period under the Company's Mortgage Loan Agreement, the Operating Partnership could elect to defer the payment of interest which deferred amount would be added to the outstanding principal balance of the loans.\nOn February 23, 2017, the Operating Partnership paid to the Original Lenders an upfront commitment fee equal to $1.0 million. On May 24, 2017, the Operating Partnership paid to the Original Lenders an additional, and final, commitment fee of $1.0 million.\nThe Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan required that the Company at all times maintain (i) a net worth of not less than $1.0 billion, and (ii) a leverage ratio not to exceed 60.0%.\nThe Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan included customary representations and warranties, covenants and indemnities. The Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan also had customary events of default, including (subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods) payment default, failure to comply with covenants, material inaccuracy of representation or warranty, and bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. If there was an event of default, the Lenders could declare all or any portion of the outstanding indebtedness to be immediately due and payable, exercise any rights they might have under any of the Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan documents, and require the Operating Partnership to pay a default interest rate on overdue amounts equal to 1.50% in excess of the applicable base interest rate.\nMr. Edward S. Lampert, the Company's Chairman, is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ESL, which controls JPP, LLC and JPP II, LLC. The terms of the Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan were approved by the Company's Audit Committee and the Company's Board of Trustees (with Mr. Edward S. Lampert recusing himself).\nOn December 27, 2017, the Operating Partnership, as borrower, and the Company, as guarantor, refinanced the Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan with a new $200 million unsecured term loan facility (the Unsecured Term Loan\u201d). The principal amount outstanding under the Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan at termination was $85 million. No prepayment penalties were triggered and the Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan terminated in accordance with its terms.\nThe lenders under the Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan, JPP, LLC and JPP II, LLC, maintained their funding of $85 million in the Unsecured Term Loan, with JPP, LLC appointed as administrative agent under the Unsecured Term Loan. An affiliate of Empyrean Capital Partners, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (and together with JPP, LLC and JPP II LLC, each an Initial Lender\u201d and collectively, the Initial Lenders\u201d), funded $60 million under the Unsecured Term Loan, resulting in a total of $145 million committed and funded under the Unsecured Term Loan at closing. Under an accordion feature, the Company has the right to increase the total commitments up to $200 million and place an additional $55 million of incremental loans with the Initial Lenders or new lenders. The Initial Lenders under the Unsecured Term Loan are not obligated to make all or any portion of the incremental loans.\nThe Company used the proceeds of the Unsecured Term Loan, among other things, to refinance the Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan, to fund redevelopment projects and for other general corporate purposes. Loans under the Unsecured Term Loan are guaranteed by the Company.\nThe Unsecured Term Loan matures on the earlier of (i) December 31, 2018 and (ii) the date on which the outstanding indebtedness under the Company's existing mortgage and mezzanine facilities are repaid in full. The Unsecured Term Loan may be prepaid at any time in whole or in part, without any penalty or premium. Amounts drawn under the Unsecured Term Loan and repaid may not be redrawn.\nThe principal amount of loans outstanding under the Unsecured Term Loan bears a base annual interest rate of 6.75%. Accrued and unpaid interest is payable in cash.\n- 50 -\nOn December 27, 2017, the Borrower paid to each Initial Lender an upfront fee in an aggregate amount equal to 1.00% of the principal amount of the loan made by such Initial Lender.\nThe Unsecured Term Loan requires that the Company at all times maintain (i) a net worth of not less than $1.0 billion, and (ii) a leverage ratio not to exceed 60.0%.\nThe Unsecured Term Loan includes customary representations and warranties, covenants and indemnities. The Unsecured Term Loan also has customary events of default, including (subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods) payment default, failure to comply with covenants, material inaccuracy of representations or warranties, and bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. If there is an event of default, the lenders may declare all or any portion of the outstanding indebtedness to be immediately due and payable, exercise any rights they might have under any of the Unsecured Term Loan documents, and require the Borrower to pay a default interest rate on overdue amounts equal to 1.50% in excess of the then applicable interest rate.\nThe Company believes it is currently in compliance with all material terms and conditions of the Unsecured Term Loan.\nThe Company incurred $1.5 million of debt issuance costs related to the Unsecured Term Loan which are recorded as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the Unsecured Term Loan and amortized over the term of the loan. As of December 31, 2017, the unamortized balance of the Company's debt issuance costs was $1.5 million.\nMr. Edward S. Lampert, the Company's Chairman, is the sole stockholder, chief executive officer and director of ESL Investments, Inc., which controls JPP, LLC and JPP II, LLC. The terms of the Unsecured Term Loan were approved by the Company's Audit Committee and the Company's Board of Trustees (with Mr. Edward S. Lampert recusing himself).\nPreferred Shares\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had 2,800,000 7.00% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares (the Series A Preferred Shares\u201d) outstanding. We may not redeem the Series A Preferred Shares before December 14, 2022, except to preserve our status as a REIT or upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, as defined in the Trust Agreement addendums designating the Series A. On and after December 14, 2022, we may redeem any or all of the Series A Preferred Shares at $25.00 per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. In addition, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, we may redeem any or all of the Series A Preferred Share for cash within 120 days after the first date on which such Change of Control occurred at $25.00 per share plus any accrued and unpaid\nHedging Instruments\nIn connection with the issuance of the Company's Mortgage Loans and Future Funding Facility, we purchased for $5.0 million an interest rate cap with a term of four years, a notional amount of $1,261 million and a strike rate of 3.5%. Our objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements. The interest rate cap is measured at fair value and included as a component of prepaid expenses, deferred expenses and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company did not elect hedge accounting and therefore the change in fair value is included within unrealized loss on interest rate cap in the consolidated statements of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded an unrealized loss of $0.7 million related to the change in fair value of the interest rate cap as compared to an unrealized loss of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the interest rate cap had a fair value of less than $0.1 million as compared to $0.7 million on December 31, 2016.\n- 51 -\nDividends and Distributions\nThe Company's Board of Trustees has declared the following common stock dividends, with holders of Operating Partnership units entitled to an equal distribution per Operating Partnership unit held on the record date:\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Dividends per\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Class A and Class C\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Declaration Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Record Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payment Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Common Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> October 24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 11, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> July 25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September 29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> April 25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> June 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> July 13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> February 28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> April 13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> November 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 12, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> August 2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> May 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> June 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> July 14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> March 8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> April 14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe currently intend to pay quarterly dividends and distributions in cash. However, the timing, amount, and composition of all dividends and distributions will be made by the Company at the discretion of its Board of Trustees. Such dividends and distributions will depend on the financial position, results of operations, cash flows, capital requirements, debt covenants, applicable law, and other factors as the Board of Trustees of Seritage deems relevant.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company accounts for its investments in joint ventures that it does not have a controlling interest or is not the primary beneficiary using the equity method of accounting and those investments are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. As of December 31, 2017, we did not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements.\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations relate to our Mortgage Loans, Future Funding Facility, Unsecured Term Loan and non-cancelable operating leases in the form of a ground lease at one of our properties, as well as operating leases for our corporate offices.\nInformation concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts for these loan and lease agreements as of December 31, 2017 is aggregated in the following table (in thousands):\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Within\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> After\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 - 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 -5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,478,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 229,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,248,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Includes expected interest payments. \nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures for Wholly Owned Properties under the Master Lease are generally the responsibility of the tenant. Given that the majority of our GLA is subject to the Master Lease as of December 31, 2017, we do not currently anticipate incurring material expenses related to maintenance capital expenditures, tenant improvement costs or leasing commissions, outside of those associated with retenanting and redevelopment projects as described below.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred maintenance capital expenditures of approximately $0.5 million and tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions of $2.0 million and $0.3 million, respectively, that were not associated with retenanting and redevelopment projects.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred maintenance capital expenditures of approximately $0.5 million and tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions of $1.3 million and $0.1 million, respectively, that were not associated with retenanting and redevelopment projects.\n- 52 -\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $69.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $110.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Significant changes in the components of net cash provided by operating activities include:\n \u2212 In 2017, a decrease in operating cash inflows of $19.0 million due the payment of a previously recorded litigation expense; and \n \u2212 In 2017, a decrease in operating cash inflows due to net reductions in rental income under the Master Lease, increased general and administrative expense and increased interest expense, offset by increased termination fee income and additional third-party rental income. \nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to net cash used by investing activities of $75.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Significant components of net cash provided by and used in investing activities include:\n \u2212 In 2017, proceeds from the sale of real estate and JV Interests, $308.2 million; \n \u2212 In 2017, development of real estate and property improvements, ($243.1) million; \n \u2212 In 2017, investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, ($38.0) million; \n \u2212 In 2016, development of real estate and property improvements, ($66.2) million; and \n \u2212 In 2016, investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, ($9.0) million. \nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $180.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to net cash used in financing activities of $50.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Significant components of net cash provided by and used in financings activities include:\n \u2212 In 2017, proceeds from the Future Funding Facility, $80.0 million; \n \u2212 In 2017, proceeds from the Unsecured Term Loan, $145.0 million; \n \u2212 In 2017, net proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock, $66.5 million; \n \u2212 In 2017, repayment of mortgage loan payables, ($50.6) million; \n \u2212 In 2017, cash distributions to common stockholders and holders of Operating Partnership units, ($55.7) million; \n \u2212 In 2016, proceeds from the Future Funding Facility, $20.0 million; and \n \u2212 In 2016, cash distributions to common stockholders and holders of Operating Partnership units, ($69.6) million. \nLitigation and Other Matters\nIn accordance with accounting standards regarding loss contingencies, the Company accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, and we disclose the amount accrued and the amount of a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued or disclose the fact that such a range of loss cannot be estimated. We do not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated, or when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. In such cases, we disclose the nature of the contingency, and an estimate of the possible loss, range of loss, or disclose the fact that an estimate cannot be made.\n- 53 -\nThe Company is subject, from time to time, to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. While the resolution of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes, based on currently available information, that the final outcome of such matters will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity of the Company.\nIn May and June of 2015, four purported Sears Holdings shareholders filed lawsuits in the Delaware Court of Chancery challenging the Transaction, which lawsuits were subsequently consolidated into a single action captioned In re Sears Holdings Corporation Stockholder and Derivative Litigation, Consol. C.A. No. 11081-VCL (the Action\u201d). On October 15, 2015, plaintiffs filed a verified consolidated stockholder derivative complaint in the Action against the individual members of Sears Holdings' Board of Directors, ESL Investments, Inc. (together with its affiliates, ESL\u201d), Sears Holdings' CEO, Fairholme Capital Management L.L.C. ( FCM\u201d), and Seritage. On July 12, 2016, the plaintiffs filed a verified consolidated amended stockholder derivative complaint (the Amended Complaint\u201d) against the same defendants and asserting substantially the same claims as set forth in the complaint filed in October 2015. The plaintiffs brought the Action derivatively on behalf of Sears Holdings, which was named as a nominal defendant, and alleged that the Sears Holdings directors, as well as ESL and Edwards S. Lampert (in their capacity as the alleged controlling stockholder of Sears Holdings), breached their fiduciary duties to Sears Holdings shareholders by selling the Wholly Owned Properties to Seritage at a price that was unfairly low and was the result of a process that allegedly was flawed. The Amended Complaint also alleged that Seritage and FCM aided and abetted these alleged fiduciary breaches. Among other forms of relief, the Amended Complaint sought damages in unspecified amounts. In October 2016, following mediation, the parties reached an agreement-in-principle to settle the Action, which ultimately was reflected in a definitive Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement, Compromise and Release executed on February 8, 2017. On May 9, 2017, the Delaware Court of Chancery, after customary notice to Sears Holding stockholders and an in-person settlement hearing, entered a final order and judgment approving the settlement. Pursuant to the settlement, (a) the defendants and the D&O insurers for the individual members of the Sears Holdings' Board of Directors paid $40.0 million, of which Seritage paid $19.0 million and (b) all defendants received customary releases. The defendants continue to deny the claims asserted and entered into the settlement solely to avoid the burden, expense, distraction, and inherent risk in and of litigation.\n- 54 -\nRetenanting and Redevelopment Projects\nWe are currently retenanting or redeveloping several properties primarily to convert single-tenant buildings occupied by Sears Holdings into multi-tenant properties occupied by a diversity of retailers and related concepts. The table below provides a brief description of each of the 63 new redevelopment projects originated on the Seritage platform as of December 31, 2017. These projects represent an estimated total investment of approximately $1,066.9 million, of which approximately $801.7 million remained to be spent.\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td> Total Project Costs under $10 Million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Estimated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Estimated\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Project\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Construction\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Substantial\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Property\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Square Feet\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Start\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Completion\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> King of Prussia, PA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Repurpose former auto center space for Outback Steakhouse, Yard House and small shop retail\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Substantially complete\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Merrillville, IN\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Termination property; redevelop existing store for At Home, Powerhouse Gym and small shop retail\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 132,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Substantially complete\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Elkhart, IN\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Termination property; existing store has been released to Big R Stores\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 86,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Substantially complete\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> San Antonio, TX\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Recapture and repurpose auto center space for Orvis, Jared's Jeweler, Shake Shack and small shop retail\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Substantially complete\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bowie, MD\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Recapture and repurpose auto center space for BJ's Brewhouse\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Substantially complete\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Troy, MI\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Partial recapture; redevelop existing store for At Home\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Substantially complete\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Roseville, MI\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Partial recapture; redevelop existing store for At Home\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Substantially complete\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Henderson, NV\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Termination property; redevelop existing store for At Home, Seafood City and additional retail\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 144,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Substantially complete\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rehoboth Beach, DE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Partial recapture; redevelop existing store for Christmas Tree Shops andThat! and PetSmart\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Substantially complete\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cullman, AL\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Termination property; redevelop existing store for Bargain Hunt, Tractor Supply and Planet Fitness\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 99,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Substantially complete\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Jefferson City, MO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Termination property; redevelop existing store for Orscheln Farm and Home\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 96,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Delivered to tenant\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Albany, NY\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Recapture and repurpose auto center space for BJ's Brewhouse and additional small shop retail\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Delivered to tenant\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hagerstown, MD\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Recapture and repurpose auto center space for BJ's Brewhouse, Verizon and additional restaurants\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Delivered to tenant\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ft.
