Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations\n(All currency and share amounts are in millions)\nThe following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto. Unless otherwise indicated, amounts provided in Item 7 pertain to continuing operations only.\nExecutive Overview\nRevenue for 2017 totaled $1,425.8, compared to $1,472.3 in 2016 (and $1,559.0 in 2015). The decrease in revenue in 2017, compared to 2016, was due to a revenue decline within our Engineered Solutions reportable segment associated primarily with a decrease in organic revenue and an aggregate reduction in revenue during 2017 of $36.9 resulting from revisions during the second and fourth quarters to the expected revenues and costs of our large power projects in South Africa. These declines were partially offset by increased revenues within our Detection and Measurement reportable segment and, to a lesser extent, our HVAC reportable segment. Revenues in 2015 included $87.3 of revenue related to the dry cooling business, which was sold at the end of the first quarter of 2016, and a reduction in revenue of $57.2 resulting from a revision to the expected revenues and costs on our large power projects in South Africa. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details on the 2017 and 2015 revenue reductions related to our large power projects in South Africa.\nIncome for our reportable segments totaled $124.9 in 2017, compared to $142.8 in 2016 (and $38.8 in 2015). During 2017, income for our reportable segments was negatively impacted by an aggregate reduction in profit of $52.8 resulting from revisions during the second and fourth quarters of 2017 to the expected revenues and costs on our large power projects in South Africa, partially offset by the impact of the revenue growth within our Detection and Measurement and HVAC reportable segments noted above and cost reductions within our Detection and Measurement and Engineered Solutions reportable segments. In 2015, income for our reportable segments was impacted by a reduction in profit of $95.0 resulting from a revision to the expected revenues and costs on our large power projects in South Africa. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details on the 2017 and 2015 profit reductions related to our large power projects in South Africa.\nOperating cash flows from (used in) continuing operations totaled $54.2 in 2017, compared to $53.4 in 2016 [and $(76.0) in 2015]. Operating cash flows from (used in) continuing operations for 2017, 2016, and 2015 were negatively impacted by cash outflows for our large power projects in South Africa of $56.5, $33.1, and $74.0, respectively, and income tax payments, net of refunds, of $22.9, $4.8, and $51.0, respectively. In addition, operating cash flows used in continuing operations in 2015 included a significant amount of disbursements for general corporate overhead costs related to a corporate structure that supported the SPX business prior to the Spin-Off.\nOther significant items impacting the financial results for 2017, 2016, and 2015 are as follows:\n2017:\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Income Tax Matters (see Notes 1 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25e6\n</td> <td>During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded an income tax benefit of $77.6 for a worthless stock deduction in the U.S. associated with our investment in a South African subsidiary.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25e6\n</td> <td>On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act\u201d) was enacted which significantly changes U.S. income tax law for businesses and individuals.

In addition, certain of our businesses have seasonal fluctuations. For example, our heating and ventilation businesses tend to be stronger in the third and fourth quarters, as customer buying habits are driven largely by seasonal weather patterns. In aggregate, our businesses generally tend to be stronger in the second half of the year.\nAlthough our businesses operate in highly competitive markets, our competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by segment since none of our competitors offer all the same product lines or serve all the same markets as we do. In addition, specific reliable comparative figures are not available for many of our competitors. In most product groups, competition comes from numerous concerns, both large and small. The principal methods of competition are service, product performance, technical innovation and price. These methods vary with the type of product sold. We believe we compete effectively on the basis of each of these factors.\nNon-GAAP Measures - Organic revenue growth (decline) presented herein is defined as revenue growth (decline) excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions/divestitures, and the impact of the revenue reduction that resulted from the second and fourth quarter 2017 and third quarter 2015 revisions to the expected revenues and profits on our large power projects in South Africa of $13.5, $23.4 and $57.2, respectively. We believe this metric is a useful financial measure for investors in evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented, as, when read in conjunction with our revenues, it presents a useful tool to evaluate our ongoing operations and provides investors with a tool they can use to evaluate our management of assets held from period to period. In addition, organic revenue\ngrowth (decline) is one of the factors we use in internal evaluations of the overall performance of our business. This metric, however, is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d), should not be considered a substitute for net revenue growth (decline) as determined in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nThe following table provides selected financial information

partially offset by increases in organic revenue within our Detection and Measurement reportable segment and, to a lesser extent, our HVAC reportable segment. In addition, revenues were negatively impacted by (i) an aggregate reduction in revenue of $36.9 resulting from revisions during the second and fourth quarters of 2017 to the expected revenues and costs on our large power projects in South Africa and (ii) the impact of the sale of the dry cooling business at the end of the first quarter of 2016. These declines in revenue were partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar during 2017. See Results of Reportable Segments\u201d for additional details.\nFor 2016, the decrease in revenues, compared to 2015, was due to the impact of the sale of the dry cooling business at the end of the first quarter of 2016, a decline in organic revenue, and, to a lesser extent, a stronger U.S. dollar in 2016. These decreases were offset partially by the impact of a reduction in revenues of $57.2 during the third quarter of 2015 resulting from a revision to the expected revenues and costs on our large power projects in South Africa. The decline in organic revenue was due primarily to lower sales of process cooling products within our Engineered Solutions reportable segment. See Results of Reportable Segments\u201d for additional details.\nGross Profit - For 2017, the decrease in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenues, compared to 2016, was due primarily to an aggregate reduction in gross profit of $52.8 resulting from revisions during the second\nand fourth quarters of 2017 to the expected revenues and costs of our large power projects in South Africa, partially offset by the impact of the organic revenue growth in our Detection and Measurement reportable segment noted above.\nThe increase in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenue in 2016, compared to 2015, was due primarily to a reduction in gross profit of $95.0 during the third quarter of 2015 associated with a revision to the expected revenues and costs of our large power projects in South Africa. In addition, during 2016, gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenues were impacted favorably by cost reductions and improved operating efficiency at the businesses within our HVAC reportable segment and our power transformer business.\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expense - For 2017, the decrease in SG&A expense, compared to 2016, was due primarily to (i) a decline in actuarial losses for our pension and postretirement plans (net losses of $1.6 in 2017, compared to net losses of $12.0 in 2016 - see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further details), (ii) the impact of the sale of the dry cooling business at the end of the first quarter of 2016, and (iii) cost reductions within our Detection and Measurement and Engineered Solutions reportable segments over the past year.\nFor 2016, the decrease in SG&A expense, compared to 2015, was due primarily to declines in corporate expense of $61.7, pension and postretirement expense of $3.2, and long-term incentive compensation expense of $20.2. See Results of Reportable Segments\u201d for additional details on corporate expense, pension and postretirement expense, and long-term incentive compensation expense.\nIntangible Amortization - For 2017, the decline in intangible amortization, compared to 2016, was primarily due to the impact of the $23.9 impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 associated with our Heat Transfer business's definite-lived intangible assets.\nFor 2016, the decline in intangible amortization, compared to 2015, was primarily the result of (i) discontinuing amortization on the long-term assets of our dry cooling business in connection with classifying the business's assets and liabilities as held for sale,\u201d effective December 31, 2015, and (ii) the impact of the $23.9 impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 associated with our Heat Transfer business's definite-lived intangible assets. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details on the impairment charge recorded for the definite-lived intangible assets of our Heat Transfer business.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets - During 2016, we recorded impairment charges of $30.1 related to the intangible assets of our Heat Transfer business, which included $23.9 for definite-lived intangible assets and $6.2 for indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nSee Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of impairment charges.\nSpecial Charges, Net - Special charges, net, related primarily to restructuring initiatives to consolidate manufacturing, distribution, sales and administrative facilities, reduce workforce, and rationalize certain product lines. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for the details of actions taken in 2017, 2016 and 2015. The components of special charges, net, are as follows:\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee termination costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Facility consolidation costs\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other cash costs, net\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash asset write-downs\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGain on Contract Settlement - During the third quarter of 2017, we settled a contract that had been suspended and then ultimately cancelled by a customer for cash proceeds of $9.0 and other consideration. In connection with the settlement, we recorded a gain of $10.2 during the quarter.\nGain on Sale of Dry Cooling Business - On March 30, 2016, we completed the sale of our dry cooling business resulting in a gain of $18.4. See Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\nOther Expense, Net - Other expense, net, for 2017 was composed primarily of charges of $3.5 associated with asbestos product liability matters, foreign currency transaction losses of $2.9, and losses on currency forward embedded derivatives ( FX embedded derivatives\u201d) of $0.6, partially offset by a gain of $2.7 associated with the\ndiscontinuance of hedge accounting on our interest rate swap agreements, income from company-owned life insurance policies of $1.7, and equity earnings in joint ventures of $0.7.\nOther expense, net, for 2016 was composed primarily of charges of $4.2 associated with asbestos product liability matters, losses on foreign currency forward contracts ( FX forward contracts\u201d) of $5.1, and losses on FX embedded derivatives of $1.2. These amounts were offset partially by foreign currency transaction gains of $3.9, income from company-owned life insurance policies of $2.8, equity earnings in joint ventures of $1.5, income associated with transition services provided in connection with the sale of the dry cooling business of $0.9, and gains on asset sales of $0.9.\nOther expense, net, for 2015 was composed primarily of charges of $8.0 associated with asbestos product liability matters, foreign currency transaction losses of $7.4, and losses on FX forward contracts of $7.7, partially offset by gains of $6.5 on FX embedded derivatives, income from company-owned life insurance policies of $3.8, and equity earnings in joint ventures of $1.5.\nInterest Expense, Net - Interest expense, net, includes both interest expense and interest income. The increase in interest expense, net, during 2017, compared to 2016, was primarily a result of a higher weighted-average interest rate and higher average debt balances during 2017, compared to 2016.\nThe decrease in interest expense, net, during 2016, compared to 2015, was primarily the result of a decline in interest expense due to lower average debt balances during 2016.\nLoss on Amendment/Refinancing of Senior Credit Agreement - During the fourth quarter of 2017, we amended our senior credit agreement. In connection with the amendment, we recorded a charge of $0.9 during 2017, which consisted of the write-off of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs related to our senior credit facilities.\nIn the third quarter of 2016, we reduced the issuance capacity under our foreign credit facilities by $200.0. In connection with such reduction, we recorded a charge of $1.3 associated with the write-off of the unamortized deferred financing costs related to the $200.0 of previously available issuance capacity.\nIn the third quarter of 2015, we refinanced our senior credit facilities in connection with the Spin-Off. As a result of the refinancing, we recorded a charge of $1.4 during 2015, which consisted of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to our prior senior credit facilities.\nIncome Taxes - During 2017, we recorded an income tax benefit of $47.9 on $36.1 of pre-tax income from continuing operations, resulting in an effective tax rate of (132.7)%. The most significant items impacting the income tax benefit for 2017 were a tax benefit of $77.6 related to a worthless stock deduction in the U.S. associated with our investment in a South African subsidiary and $4.9 of tax benefits related to various audit settlements, statute expirations, and other adjustments to liabilities for uncertain tax positions, partially offset by $11.8 of net tax charges associated with the impact of the new tax regulations in the U.S. previously discussed and foreign losses generated during the year of $68.2 for which no foreign tax benefit was recognized as future realization of a foreign tax benefit is considered unlikely.\nDuring 2016, we recorded an income tax provision of $9.1 on $39.4 of a pre-tax income from continuing operations, resulting in an effective tax rate of 23.1%. The most significant items impacting the effective tax rate for 2016 were the $0.3 of income taxes provided in connection with the $18.4 gain that was recorded on the sale of the dry cooling business, $13.7 of foreign losses generated during the period for which no tax benefit was recognized as future realization of any such foreign tax benefit is considered unlikely, and $2.4 of tax benefits related to various audit settlements, statute expirations, and other adjustments to liabilities for uncertain tax positions.\nDuring 2015, we recorded an income tax benefit of $2.7 on $154.3 of a pre-tax loss from continuing operations, resulting in an effective tax rate of 1.7%. The most significant item impacting the effective tax rate for 2015 was the effects of approximately $139.0 of foreign losses generated during the year for which no tax benefit was recognized, as future realization of such foreign tax benefit is considered unlikely. In addition, we incurred foreign tax charges of $3.7 related to the Spin-Off and the reorganization actions undertaken to facilitate the Spin-Off and $3.4 of net charges related to various audit settlements, statute expirations, and other adjustments to liabilities for uncertain tax positions.\nResults of Discontinued Operations\nSale of Balcke D\u00fcrr Business\nAs indicated in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, we completed the sale of Balcke D\u00fcrr on December 30, 2016 for cash proceeds of less than $0.1. In addition, we left $21.1 of cash in Balcke D\u00fcrr at the time of the sale and provided the buyer with a non-interest bearing loan of $9.1, payable in installments due at the end of 2018 and 2019. In connection with the sale, we recorded a net loss of $78.6 to Gain (loss) on disposition of discontinued operations, net of tax\u201d within our consolidated statement of operations for 2016.\nThe results of Balcke D\u00fcrr are presented as a discontinued operation.

The increase in organic revenue was due primarily to an increase in sales of cooling products and heating and ventilation products, partially offset by a decline in sales of boiler products.\nFor 2016, the decrease in revenues, compared to 2015, was due to a decline in organic revenue and, to a lesser extent, the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar during 2016. The organic revenue decline primarily was the result of lower sales of heating and ventilation products.\nIncome - For 2017, income and margin decreased, compared to 2016, primarily as a result of a less profitable sales mix associated with the segment's cooling and boiler products as well as lower absorption of fixed costs within the boiler products business due to the lower sales volumes noted above.\nFor 2016, margin increased, compared to 2015, primarily as a result of improved operating efficiency and a more profitable sales mix within the segment's heating and ventilation products businesses.\nBacklog - The segment had backlog of $41.4 and $28.3 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Approximately 99% of the segment's backlog as of December 31, 2017 is expected to be recognized as revenue during 2018.\nDetection and Measurement Reportable Segment\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs.\n2016%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs.\n2015%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>260.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>226.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>232.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income\n</td> <td>63.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% of revenues\n</td> <td>24.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of revenue increase (decline):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Organic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenue increase (decline)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues - For 2017, the increase in revenues, compared to 2016, was due to an increase in organic revenue. The increase in organic revenue was the result of an increase in sales for all of the primary product lines within the segment.\nFor 2016, the decrease in revenues, compared to 2015, was due to a stronger U.S. dollar in 2016 and, to a lesser extent, a decline in organic revenue. The decline in organic revenue was due primarily to a decrease in sales of communication technologies products, generally offset by increases in sales of bus fare collection systems and specialty lighting products.\nIncome - For 2017, the increase in income and margin, compared to 2016, was due primarily to the revenue increase noted above and lower SG&A expense resulting from cost reductions within our bus fare collection systems' and communication technologies' businesses.\nFor 2016, the decrease in income, compared to 2015, was primarily due to the revenue decline noted above.\nBacklog - The segment had backlog of $54.0 and $53.6 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Approximately 65% of the segment's backlog as of December 31, 2017 is expected to be recognized as revenue during 2018.\nEngineered Solutions Reportable Segment\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs.\n2016%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs.\n2015%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>654.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>736.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>797.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss)\n</td> <td>(12.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(87.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% of revenues\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of revenue decline:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Organic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sale of dry cooling business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>South Africa revenue revision\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenue decline\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________________________________________________________________\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>*\n</td> <td>Not meaningful for comparison purposes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Revenues - For 2017, the decrease in revenues, compared to 2016, was due primarily to a decline in organic revenue, partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar versus the South African Rand during 2017. The decline in organic revenue was the result of lower sales related to the segment's large power projects in South Africa, as these projects generally are in the latter stages of completion, as well as lower sales of power transformers and process cooling products. The decrease in power transformer sales was due primarily to the timing of shipments. In addition, our process cooling business has been impacted by a shift in its sales model, whereby it is now focused more on high-margin components and services and less on lower-margin large projects. In addition, the decrease in revenues compared to the same period in 2016, resulted from an aggregate reduction in revenue of $36.9 related to revisions during the second and fourth quarters of 2017 to the expected revenues and costs on the segment's large power projects in South Africa and the impact of the sale of the dry cooling business at the end of the first quarter of 2016.\nFor 2016, the decrease in revenues, compared to 2015, was due primarily to the impact of the sale of the dry cooling business at the end of the first quarter of 2016, a decline in organic revenue, and, to a lesser extent, the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar in 2016, partially offset by the impact of a reduction in revenues of $57.2 during the third quarter of 2015 resulting from a revision to the expected revenues and costs on the segment's large power projects in South Africa. The decline in organic revenues was due primarily to lower sales of process cooling products.\nIncome - For 2017, the decrease in profit and margin, compared to 2016, was due primarily to an aggregate reduction in profit of $52.8 associated with revisions during the second and fourth quarters of 2017 to the expected revenues and costs of the segment's large power projects in South Africa, partially offset by a $10.2 gain recorded during the third quarter of 2017 resulting from the settlement of a contract that had been suspended and then ultimately cancelled by a customer. In addition, income and margin in 2017, compared to 2016, were favorably impacted by cost reductions at the segment's Heat Transfer business resulting from restructuring actions that were implemented in 2016 and the sale of the dry cooling business, which generated losses in 2016 prior to its sale.\nFor 2016, the increase in profit and margin, compared to 2015, was due primarily to the fact that the segment's results for 2015 included a reduction in profit of $95.0 during the third quarter of 2015 resulting from a revision to the expected revenues and costs on the segment's large power projects in South Africa. During 2016, income and margin for the segment's power transformer business increased as a result of improved operating efficiency. However, these increases were offset partially by lower profitability from process cooling products resulting primarily from the decline in revenue noted above.\nBacklog - The segment had backlog of $434.0 and $416.7 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Approximately 83% of the segment's backlog as of December 31, 2017 is expected to be recognized as revenue during 2018.\nCorporate Expense and Other Expense\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs.\n2016%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs.\n2015%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total consolidated revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,425.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,472.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,559.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate expense\n</td> <td>46.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(59.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% of revenues\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension and postretirement expense\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(64.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term incentive compensation expense\n</td> <td>15.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(59.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCorporate Expense - Corporate expense generally relates to the cost of our Charlotte, NC corporate headquarters. Prior to the Spin-Off, corporate expense also included costs of our Asia Pacific center in Shanghai, China, which was part of the Spin-Off, costs that were previously allocated to the Flow Business that do not meet the requirements to be presented within discontinued operations, and the cost of corporate employees who became employees of SPX FLOW at the time of the Spin-Off. The increase in corporate expense in 2017, compared to 2016, was due primarily to higher incentive compensation expense, as well as higher professional fees. The decrease in corporate expense in 2016, compared to 2015, was due primarily to the elimination of costs in connection with the Spin-Off, including the cost of corporate employees who became employees of SPX FLOW.\nPension and Postretirement Expense - Pension and postretirement expense represents our consolidated expense, which we do not allocate for segment reporting purposes. The decrease in pension and postretirement expense in 2017, compared to 2016, was due primarily to a decline in actuarial losses, as net actuarial losses totaled $1.6 in 2017 and $12.0 in 2016. Actuarial losses in 2017 included net charges of $4.2 related to our fourth quarter remeasurement of our plans' assets and liabilities, partially offset by an actuarial gain of $2.6 recorded in the third quarter of 2017 associated with the remeasurement of the unfunded liability related to certain postretirement benefits. The fourth quarter 2017 net charges resulted primarily from lower discount rates applied to our plans' projected benefit obligations, partially offset by better than expected returns on our plans' assets.\nThe decrease in pension and postretirement expense in 2016, compared to 2015, was due to a decline in actuarial losses, as actuarial losses in 2016 totaled $12.0 compared to $15.9 in 2015. Actuarial losses for 2016 and 2015 resulted primarily from our fourth quarter remeasurement of our plan's assets and liabilities, with the resulting charges for the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2015 totaling $10.2 and $9.6, respectively. The fourth quarter 2016 charges resulted primarily from lower discount rates applied to our plans' projected benefit obligations, while the fourth quarter 2015 charges resulted primarily from lower than expected returns on plan assets. Actuarial losses for 2016 also included charges of $1.8 associated with the second quarter 2016 remeasurement of the assets and liabilities of the SPX U.S. Pension Plan (the U.S. Plan\u201d) and Supplemental Individual Account Retirement Plan ( SIARP\u201d) in connection with lump-sum payments that were made by these plans during the quarter. Actuarial losses for 2015 also included charges of $11.4 associated with the third quarter 2015 remeasurement of the assets and liabilities of the U.S. Plan and SIARP in connection with an amendment to these plans to freeze all benefits of active non-union participants. This amendment also resulted in a curtailment gain of $5.1 during the third quarter of 2015.\nSee Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further details on our pension and postretirement plans.\nLong-term Incentive Compensation Expense - The increase in long-term incentive compensation expense during 2017, compared to the respective period in 2016, was due primarily to additional charges of $1.6 in 2017 associated with certain of our long-term cash-awards, as we now expect to exceed the three-year segment income performance target required of these awards. The decrease in long-term incentive compensation expense in 2016, compared to 2015, was due primarily to the fact that the 2015 amount included $21.6 of costs related to corporate employees who became employees of SPX FLOW at the time of the Spin-Off or retired in connection with the Spin-Off.\nSee Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further details on our long-term incentive compensation plans.\nLiquidity and Financial Condition\nListed below are the cash flows from (used in) operating, investing and financing activities, and discontinued operations, as well as the net change in cash and equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Continuing operations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows from (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(76.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows from (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>(11.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows used in financing activities\n</td> <td>(6.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(173.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows used in discontinued operations\n</td> <td>(6.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(77.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in cash and equivalents due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates\n</td> <td>(5.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(57.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(326.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 Compared to 2016\nOperating Activities - The increase in cash flows from operating activities, compared to 2016, was due primarily to improved operating cash flows across our businesses related to improved profitability and reductions in working capital, partially offset by a year-over-year increase in net income tax payments ($22.9 in 2017, compared to $4.8 in 2016) and an increase in cash outflows associated with our large power projects in South Africa ($56.5 in 2017, compared to $33.1 in 2016).\nInvesting Activities - Cash flows used in investing activities for 2017 were comprised of capital expenditures of $11.0 and an increase in restricted cash of $0.3. Cash flows from investing activities for 2016 related to proceeds from asset sales of $48.1 (including proceeds from the sale of the dry cooling business of $47.6), partially offset by capital expenditures of $11.7.\nFinancing Activities - During 2017, net cash flows used in financing activities primarily related to financing fees of $3.6 paid in connection with the December 2017 amendment of our senior credit agreement and net repayments under our various debt instruments of $1.3. During 2016, net cash flows used in financing activities primarily related to net repayments of debt of $18.9.\nDiscontinued Operations - Cash flows used in discontinued operations for 2017 related to disbursements for liabilities retained in connection with dispositions, while cash flows used in discontinued operations during 2016 related primarily to the operations of our Balcke D\u00fcrr business and the cash disposed of in connection with the sale of Balcke D\u00fcrr.\nChange in Cash and Equivalents due to Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates - Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on our cash and equivalents during 2017 and 2016.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nOperating Activities - The increase in cash flows from operating activities during 2016, compared to 2015, was due primarily to the fact that cash flows used in operating activities during 2015 included disbursements for general corporate overhead costs related to a corporate structure that supported the SPX business prior to the Spin-Off. As previously noted, a significant portion of this corporate structure transferred to SPX FLOW at the time of the Spin-Off and, thus, was no longer part of our company during 2016. In addition, operating cash flows associated with our businesses increased during 2016, compared to 2015, primarily as a result of the timing of cash receipts on certain long-term projects.\nInvesting Activities - Cash flows from investing activities for 2016 related to proceeds from asset sales of $48.1 (including proceeds from the sale of the dry cooling business of $47.6), partially offset by capital expenditures of $11.7. Cash flows used in investing activities during 2015 related to capital expenditures of $16.0, partially offset by proceeds from asset sales of $2.0.\nFinancing Activities - During 2016, net cash flows used in financing activities primarily related to net repayments of debt of $18.9. During 2015, net cash flows used in financing activities primarily related to the cash dividend to SPX\nFLOW in connection with the Spin-Off of $208.6 and dividends paid of $45.9, partially offset by net borrowings under our senior credit facilities of $97.0.\nDiscontinued Operations - Cash flows used in discontinued operations during 2016 related primarily to the operations of our Balcke D\u00fcrr business and the cash disposed of in connection with the sale of Balcke D\u00fcrr, while cash flows used in discontinued operations during 2015 related primarily to the cash flows associated with the FLOW Business.\nChange in Cash and Equivalents due to Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates - Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on our cash and equivalents during 2016. The decrease in cash and equivalents due to foreign currency exchange rates for 2015 reflected primarily a reduction in U.S. dollar equivalent balances of our Euro-denominated cash and equivalents as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro during the period.\nBorrowings\nThe following summarizes our debt activity (both current and non-current) for the year ended December 31, 2017:\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Repayments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(54.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term loans (1)(2)\n</td> <td>339.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>350.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(341.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>347.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade receivables financing arrangement (3)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(74.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other indebtedness (4)\n</td> <td>16.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt\n</td> <td>356.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>517.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(518.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>356.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: short-term debt\n</td> <td>14.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: current maturities of long-term debt\n</td> <td>17.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total long-term debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>323.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>349.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____________________________________________________________\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>As noted below, we amended our senior credit agreement on December 19, 2017 and proceeds of $350.0 were made available by way of a new term loan facility, with $328.1 utilized to repay, in full, amounts outstanding under the then-existing term loan facility\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>The new term loan is repayable in quarterly installments of 1.25% of the initial loan amount of $350.0, beginning in the first quarter of 2019, with the remaining balance payable in full on December 19, 2022.

All borrowings and other extensions of credit under the Credit Agreement are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including absence of defaults and accuracy in material respects of representations and warranties.\nThe letters of credit under the domestic revolving credit facility are stand-by letters of credit requested by SPX on behalf of any of our subsidiaries or certain joint ventures. The foreign credit instrument facility is used to issue foreign credit instruments, including bank undertakings to support our foreign operations.\nThe interest rates applicable to loans under the Credit Agreement are, at our option, equal to either (i) an alternate base rate (the highest of (a) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5%, (b) the prime rate of Bank of America, N.A., and (c) the one-month LIBOR rate plus 1.0%) or (ii) a reserve-adjusted LIBOR rate for dollars (Eurodollars) plus, in each case, an applicable margin percentage as previously discussed, which varies based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement generally as the ratio of consolidated total debt (excluding the face amount of undrawn letters of credit, bank undertakings and analogous instruments and net of cash and cash equivalents not to exceed $150.0) at the date of determination to consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the four fiscal quarters ended most recently before such date). We may elect interest periods of one, two, three or six months (and, if consented to by all relevant lenders, twelve months) for Eurodollar borrowings.\nThe weighted-average interest rate of outstanding borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities was approximately 3.2% at December 31, 2017.\nThe fees and bilateral foreign credit commitments are as specified above for foreign credit commitments unless otherwise agreed with the bilateral foreign issuing lender. We also pay fronting fees on the outstanding amounts of letters of credit and foreign credit instruments (in the participation facility) at the rates of 0.125% per annum and 0.25% per annum, respectively.\nThe Credit Agreement requires mandatory prepayments in amounts equal to the net proceeds from the sale or other disposition of, including from any casualty to, or governmental taking of, property in excess of specified values (other than in the ordinary course of business and subject to other exceptions) by SPX or our subsidiaries. Mandatory prepayments will be applied to repay, first, amounts outstanding under any term loans and, then, amounts (or cash collateralize letters of credit) outstanding under the global revolving credit facility and the domestic revolving credit facility (without reducing the commitments thereunder). No prepayment is required generally to the extent the net proceeds are reinvested (or committed to be reinvested) in permitted acquisitions, permitted investments or assets to be used in our business within 360 days (and if committed to be reinvested, actually reinvested within 180 days after the end of such 360-day period) of the receipt of such proceeds.\nWe may voluntarily prepay loans under the Credit Agreement, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. Any voluntary prepayment of loans will be subject to reimbursement of the lenders' breakage costs in the case of a prepayment of Eurodollar rate borrowings other than on the last day of the relevant interest period. Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement is guaranteed by:\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Each existing and subsequently acquired or organized domestic material subsidiary with specified exceptions; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>SPX with respect to the obligations of our foreign borrower subsidiaries under the global revolving credit facility, the participation foreign credit instrument facility and the bilateral foreign credit instrument facility.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement is secured by a first priority pledge and security interest in 100% of the capital stock of our domestic subsidiaries (with certain exceptions) held by SPX or our domestic subsidiary guarantors and 65% of the capital stock of our material first-tier foreign subsidiaries (with certain exceptions). If SPX obtains a corporate credit rating from Moody's and S&P and such corporate credit rating is less than Ba2\u201d (or not rated) by Moody's and less than BB\u201d (or not rated) by S&P, then SPX and our domestic subsidiary guarantors are required to grant security interests, mortgages and other liens on substantially all of their assets. If SPX's corporate credit rating is Baa3\u201d or better by Moody's or BBB-\u201d or better by S&P and no defaults then exist, all collateral security is to be released and the indebtedness under the Credit Agreement would be unsecured.\nThe Credit Agreement requires that SPX maintain:\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (defined in the Credit Agreement generally as the ratio of consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the four fiscal quarters ended on such date to consolidated cash interest expense for such period) as of the last day of any fiscal quarter of at least 3.50 to 1.00; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>As previously discussed, a Consolidated Leverage Ratio as of the last day of any fiscal quarter of not more than 3.50 to 1.00 (or 4.00 to 1.00 for the four fiscal quarters after certain permitted acquisitions).\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The Credit Agreement also contains covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, make investments, loans, guarantees, or advances, make restricted junior payments, including dividends, redemptions of capital stock, and voluntary prepayments or repurchase of certain other indebtedness, engage in mergers, acquisitions or sales of assets, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, or engage\nin certain transactions with affiliates, and otherwise restrict certain corporate activities. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default.\nAs previously discussed, we are permitted under the Credit Agreement to repurchase our capital stock and pay cash dividends in an unlimited amount if our Consolidated Leverage Ratio is (after giving pro forma effect to such payments) less than 2.75 to 1.00. If our Consolidated Leverage Ratio is (after giving pro forma effect to such payments) greater than or equal to 2.75 to 1.00, the aggregate amount of such repurchases and dividend declarations cannot exceed (A) $50.0 in any fiscal year plus (B) an additional amount for all such repurchases and dividend declarations made after the effective date equal to the sum of (i) $100.0 plus (ii) a positive amount equal to 50% of cumulative Consolidated Net Income (as defined in the Credit Agreement generally as consolidated net income subject to certain adjustments solely for the purposes of determining this basket) during the period from the effective date to the end of the most recent fiscal quarter preceding the date of such repurchase or dividend declaration for which financial statements have been (or were required to be) delivered (or, in case such Consolidated Net Income is a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit) plus (iii) certain other amounts.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had $314.3 of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities after giving effect to $35.7 reserved for outstanding letters of credit. In addition, at December 31, 2017, we had $16.9 of available issuance capacity under our foreign credit instrument facilities after giving effect to $183.1 reserved for outstanding letters of credit.\nAt December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants of our Credit Agreement.\nOther Borrowings and Financing Activities\nCertain of our businesses purchase goods and services under purchase card programs allowing for payment beyond their normal payment terms. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the participating businesses had $2.8 and $3.9, respectively, outstanding under these arrangements.\nWe are party to a trade receivables financing agreement, whereby we can borrow, on a continuous basis, up to $50.0. Availability of funds may fluctuate over time given changes in eligible receivable balances, but will not exceed the $50.0 program limit. The facility contains representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities customary for facilities of this type. The facility does not contain any covenants that we view as materially constraining to the activities of our business.\nIn addition, we maintain line of credit facilities in China, India, and South Africa available to fund operations in these regions, when necessary. At December 31, 2017, the aggregate amount of borrowing capacity under these facilities was $20.2, while the aggregate borrowings outstanding were $4.2.\nFinancial Instruments\nWe measure our financial assets and liabilities on a recurring basis, and nonfinancial assets and liabilities on a non-recurring basis, at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We utilize market data or assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1), significant other observable inputs (Level 2) or significant unobservable inputs (Level 3).\nOur derivative financial assets and liabilities include interest rate swap agreements, FX forward contracts, FX embedded derivatives, and forward contracts that manage the exposure on forecasted purchases of commodity raw materials ( commodity contracts\u201d) that are measured at fair value using observable market inputs such as forward rates, interest rates, our own credit risk and our counterparties' credit risks. Based on these inputs, the derivative assets and liabilities are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Based on our continued ability to enter into forward contracts, we consider the markets for our fair value instruments active.\nAs of December 31, 2017, there was no significant impact to the fair value of our derivative liabilities due to our own credit risk as the related instruments are collateralized under our Senior Credit Facilities. Similarly, there was no significant impact to the fair value of our derivative assets based on our evaluation of our counterparties' credit risk.\nWe primarily use the income approach, which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are further discussed below.\nInterest Rate Swaps\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, we entered into interest rate swap agreements ( Swaps\u201d) to hedge the interest rate risk on our then existing variable rate term loan. As a result of amending our Credit Agreement on December 19, 2017, these Swaps no longer qualified for hedge accounting, resulting in a gain (recorded to Other expense, net\u201d) in 2017 of $2.7. As of December 31, 2017, the aggregate notional amount of these Swaps was $162.6. In addition, we have recorded a current asset of $3.3 as of December 31, 2017 to recognize the fair value of these Swaps. As of December 31, 2016, the unrealized gain, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI\u201d) was $0.7.\nCurrency Forward Contracts\nWe manufacture and sell our products in a number of countries and, as a result, are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Our objective is to preserve the economic value of non-functional currency-denominated cash flows and to minimize the impact of changes as a result of currency fluctuations. Our principal currency exposures relate to the South African Rand, GBP and Euro.\nFrom time to time, we enter into forward contracts to manage the exposure on contracts with forecasted transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and to manage the risk of transaction gains and losses associated with assets/liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of certain subsidiaries ( FX forward contracts\u201d). In addition, some of our contracts contain currency forward embedded derivatives ( FX embedded derivatives\u201d), because the currency of exchange is not clearly and closely\u201d related to the functional currency of either party to the transaction. Certain of our FX forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. To the extent these derivatives are effective in offsetting the variability of the hedged cash flows, changes in the derivatives' fair value are not included in current earnings, but are included in AOCI. These changes in fair value are reclassified into earnings as a component of revenues or cost of products sold, as applicable, when the forecasted transaction impacts earnings. In addition, if the forecasted transaction is no longer probable, the cumulative change in the derivatives' fair value is recorded as a component of Other expense, net\u201d in the period in which the transaction is no longer considered probable of occurring. To the extent a previously designated hedging transaction is no longer an effective hedge, any ineffectiveness measured in the hedging relationship is recorded in earnings in the period in which it occurs.\nWe had FX forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $9.0 and $8.8 outstanding as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, with all of the $9.0 scheduled to mature in 2018. We also had FX embedded derivatives with an aggregate notional amount of $1.1 and $0.9 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, with all of the $1.1 scheduled to mature in 2018. There were no unrealized gains or losses recorded in AOCI related to FX forward contracts as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. The net loss recorded in Other expense, net\u201d related to FX forward contracts and embedded derivatives totaled $0.4 in 2017, $6.3 in 2016 and $1.2 in 2015.\nCommodity Contracts\nFrom time to time, we enter into commodity contracts to manage the exposure on forecasted purchases of commodity raw materials. The outstanding notional amounts of commodity contracts were 3.6 and 4.1 pounds of copper at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We designate and account for these contracts as cash flow hedges and, to the extent these commodity contracts are effective in offsetting the variability of the forecasted purchases, the change in fair value is included in AOCI. We reclassify AOCI associated with our commodity contracts to cost of products sold when the forecasted transaction impacts earnings. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the fair value of these contracts was $1.1 (current asset) and $1.1 (current asset), respectively. The unrealized gain (loss), net of taxes, recorded in AOCI was $0.8 and $0.8 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We anticipate reclassifying the unrealized gain as of December 31, 2017 to income over the next 12 months.\nOther Fair Value Financial Assets and Liabilities\nThe carrying amounts of cash and equivalents and receivables reported in our consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value due to the short maturity of those instruments.\nThe fair value of our debt instruments as of December 31, 2017 approximated the related carrying values due primarily to the variable market-based interest rates for such instruments.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and equivalents, trade accounts receivable, and interest rate swap, foreign currency forward, and commodity contracts.\nThese financial instruments, other than trade accounts receivable, are placed with high-quality financial institutions throughout the world. We periodically evaluate the credit standing of these financial institutions.\nWe maintain cash levels in bank accounts that, at times, may exceed federally-insured limits. We have not experienced significant, and believe we are not exposed to significant risk of, loss in these accounts.\nWe have credit loss exposure in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the above financial instruments, but have no other off-balance-sheet credit risk of accounting loss. We anticipate, however, that counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts. We do not obtain collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk, but we do monitor the credit standing of counterparties.\nConcentrations of credit risk arising from trade accounts receivable are due to selling to customers in a particular industry. Credit risks are mitigated by performing ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial conditions and obtaining collateral, advance payments, or other security when appropriate. No one customer, or group of customers that to our knowledge are under common control, accounted for more than 10% of our revenues for any period presented.\nCash and Other Commitments\nOur Senior Credit Facilities are payable in full on December 19, 2022. Our term loan is repayable in quarterly installments of 1.25% of the initial loan amount of $350.0, beginning in the first fiscal quarter of 2019. The remaining balance is repayable in full on December 19, 2022.\nWe use operating leases to finance certain equipment, vehicles and properties. At December 31, 2017, we had $38.3 of future minimum rental payments under operating leases with remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year.\nCapital expenditures for 2017 totaled $11.0, compared to $11.7 and $16.0 in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2017 related primarily to upgrades to manufacturing facilities, including replacement of equipment. We expect 2018 capital expenditures to approximate $12.0 to $14.0, with a significant portion related to replacement of equipment.\nIn 2017, we made contributions and direct benefit payments of $18.7 to our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans. We expect to make $17.4 of minimum required funding contributions and direct benefit payments in 2018. Our pension plans have not experienced any liquidity difficulties or counterparty defaults due to the volatility in the credit markets. Our pension funds earned asset returns of approximately 8% in 2017. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further disclosure of expected future contributions and benefit payments.\nOn a net basis, both from continuing and discontinued operations, we paid $22.9, $4.8 and $51.0 of income taxes for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In 2017, we made payments of $25.6 associated with the actual and estimated tax liability for federal, state and foreign tax obligations and received refunds of $2.7. The amount of income taxes that we pay annually is dependent on various factors, including the timing of certain deductions. Deductions and the amount of income taxes can and do vary from year to year.\nAs of December 31, 2017, except as discussed in Notes 4, 13 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements and in the contractual obligations table below, we did not have any material guarantees, off-balance sheet arrangements or purchase commitments other than the following: (i) $35.7 of certain standby letters of credit outstanding, all of which reduce the available borrowing capacity on our domestic revolving credit facility; (ii) $183.1 of letters of credit outstanding, all of which reduce the available borrowing capacity on our foreign trade facilities; and (iii) approximately $102.4 of surety bonds. In addition, $35.7 of our standby letters of credit relate to self-insurance or environmental matters.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides that we indemnify our officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law for any personal liability in connection with their employment or service with us, subject to limited exceptions. While we maintain insurance for this type of liability, the liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage.\nWe continually review each of our businesses in order to determine their long-term strategic fit. These reviews could result in selected acquisitions to expand an existing business or result in the disposition of an existing business. In addition, you should read Risk Factors,\u201d Results for Reportable Segments\u201d included in this MD&A, and Business\u201d for an understanding of the risks, uncertainties and trends facing our businesses.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following is a summary of our primary contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Due\nWithin\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Due in\n1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Due in\n3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Due After\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term debt obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations\n</td> <td>352.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>315.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions and payments(1)\n</td> <td>210.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>136.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase and other contractual obligation(2)\n</td> <td>91.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Future minimum operating lease payment(3)\n</td> <td>38.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments\n</td> <td>68.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual cash obligations(4)(5)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>767.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>137.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>376.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________________\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Estimated minimum required pension funding and pension and postretirement benefit payments are based on actuarial estimates using current assumptions for, among other things, discount rates, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets (where applicable), rate of compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates.

The accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and that require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties, are listed below. This section should be read in conjunction with Notes 1 and 2 to our consolidated financial statements, which include a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies.\nContingent Liabilities\nNumerous claims, complaints and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business have been asserted or are pending against us or certain of our subsidiaries (collectively, claims\u201d). These claims relate to litigation matters (e.g., class actions, derivative lawsuits and contracts, intellectual property and competitive claims), environmental matters, product liability matters (predominately associated with alleged exposure to asbestos-containing materials), and other risk management matters (e.g., general liability, automobile, and workers' compensation claims). Additionally, we may become subject to other claims of which we are currently unaware, which may be significant, or the claims of which we are aware may result in our incurring significantly greater loss than we anticipate. While we (and our subsidiaries) maintain property, cargo, auto, product, general liability, environmental, and directors' and officers' liability insurance and have acquired rights under similar policies in connection with acquisitions that we believe cover a significant portion of these claims, this insurance may be insufficient or unavailable (e.g., in the case of insurer\ninsolvency) to protect us against potential loss exposures. Also, while we believe we are entitled to indemnification from third parties for some of these claims, these rights may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures.\nOur recorded liabilities related to these matters totaled $685.7 (including $641.2 for asbestos product liability matters) and $653.5 (including $605.6 for asbestos product liability matters) at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The liabilities we record for these claims are based on a number of assumptions, including historical claims and payment experience and, with respect to asbestos claims, actuarial estimates of the future period during which additional claims are reasonably foreseeable. While we base our assumptions on facts currently known to us, they entail inherently subjective judgments and uncertainties. As a result, our current assumptions for estimating these liabilities may not prove accurate, and we may be required to adjust these liabilities in the future, which could result in charges to earnings. These variances relative to current expectations could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe have recorded insurance recovery assets associated with the asbestos product liability matters, with such amounts totaling $590.9 and $564.4 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These assets represent amounts that we believe we are or will be entitled to recover under agreements we have with insurance companies. The assets we record for these insurance recoveries are based on a number of assumptions, including the continued solvency of the insurers, and are subject to a variety of uncertainties. Our current assumptions for estimating these assets may not prove accurate, and we may be required to adjust these assets in the future, which could result in additional charges to earnings. These variances relative to current expectations could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nLarge Power Projects in South Africa\nThe business environment surrounding our large power projects in South Africa remains difficult, as we have experienced delays, cost over-runs, and various other challenges associated with a complex set of contractual relationships among the end customer, prime contractors, various subcontractors (including us and our subcontractors), and various suppliers. We currently are involved in a number of claim disputes relating to these challenges. We are pursuing various commercial alternatives for addressing these challenges, in attempt to mitigate our overall financial exposure.\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, we gained additional insight into the path for completing these projects, including our remaining scope, the estimated costs for completing such scope, and our expected recoverability of costs from prime contractors and our subcontractors. In response to this new information, we revised our estimates of revenues and costs associated with the projects. These revisions resulted in an increase in our Loss from continuing operations before income taxes\u201d for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $95.0, which is comprised of a reduction in revenue of $57.2 and an increase in cost of products sold of $37.8.\nOver the past two years, we have implemented various initiatives that have reduced the risk associated with our large power projects in South Africa, including more recent steps to accelerate the timeline for completing certain portions of the projects. In addition, significant progress has occurred with regard to the projects, as we have now completed the majority of our contractual scope and expect to complete the remainder by the end of 2019.\nDuring 2017, we experienced higher than expected costs associated with (i) our efforts to accelerate completion of certain scopes of work, (ii) financial and other challenges facing certain of our subcontractors, and (iii) delays and other on-site productivity challenges. As a result, during the second and fourth quarters of 2017, we revised our estimates of revenues and costs associated with the projects. These revisions resulted in a charge to Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes\u201d of $52.8 during the year ended December 31, 2017 ($22.9 and $29.9, during the second and fourth quarters of 2017, respectively), which is comprised of a reduction in revenue of $36.9 ($13.5 and $23.4, during the second and fourth quarters of 2017, respectively) and an increase in cost of products sold of $15.9 ($9.4 and $6.5, during the second and fourth quarters of 2017, respectively).\nWe recognize revenue associated with unapproved change orders and claims to the extent the related costs have been incurred and the amount expected of recovery is probable and reasonably estimable. At December 31, 2017, the projected revenues related to our large power projects in South Africa included approximately $29.0 related to claims and unapproved change orders. We believe these amounts are recoverable under the provisions of the related contracts and reflect our best estimate of recoverable amounts.\nAlthough we believe that our current estimates of revenues and costs relating to these projects are reasonable, it is possible that future revisions of such estimates could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nNoncontrolling Interest in South African Subsidiary\nOur South African subsidiary, DBT Technologies (PTY) LTD ( DBT\u201d), has a Black Economic Empowerment shareholder (the BEE Partner\u201d) that holds a 25.1% noncontrolling interest in DBT. Under the terms of the shareholder agreement between the BEE Partner and SPX Technologies (PTY) LTD ( SPX Technologies\u201d), the BEE Partner had the option to put its ownership interest in DBT to SPX Technologies, the majority shareholder of DBT, at a redemption amount determined in accordance with the terms of the shareholder agreement (the Put Option\u201d). The BEE Partner notified SPX Technologies of its intention to exercise the Put Option and, on July 6, 2016, an Arbitration Tribunal declared that the BEE Partner was entitled to South African Rand 287.3 in connection with the exercise of the Put Option, having not considered an amount due from the BEE Partner under a promissory note of South African Rand 30.3 held by SPX Technologies. As a result, we have reflected the net redemption amount of South African Rand 257.0 (or $20.9 and $18.5 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively) within Accrued expenses\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, with the related offset recorded to Paid-in-capital\u201d and Accumulated other comprehensive income.\u201d In addition, during 2016 we reclassified $38.7 from Noncontrolling Interests\u201d to Paid-in capital.\u201d Lastly, under the two-class method of calculating earnings per share, we have reflected an adjustment of $18.1 to Net income (loss) attributable to SPX Corporation common shareholders\u201d for the excess redemption amount of the Put Option (i.e., the increase in the redemption amount during the year ended December 31, 2016 in excess of fair value) in our calculations of basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nIn August 2016, SPX Technologies applied to the High Court of South Africa (the Court\u201d) to have the Arbitration Tribunal's ruling set aside. The Court heard arguments on SPX Technologies application in November 2017. On January 22, 2018, the Court ruled in SPX Technologies favor and set aside the Arbitration Tribunal's ruling. This ruling by the Court is subject to appeal by the BEE Partner. The BEE Partner has filed for leave to appeal the decision and SPX Technologies will continue to assert all legal defenses available to it.\nBeginning in the third quarter of 2016, in connection with our accounting for the redemption of the BEE Partner's ownership interest in DBT, we discontinued allocating earnings/losses of DBT to the BEE Partner within our consolidated financial statements.\nPatent Infringement Lawsuit\nOur subsidiary, SPX Cooling Technologies, Inc. ( SPXCT\u201d), is a defendant in a legal action brought by Baltimore Aircoil Company ( BAC\u201d) alleging that a SPXCT product infringes United States Patent No. 7,107,782, entitled Evaporative Heat Exchanger and Method.\u201d BAC filed suit on July 16, 2013 in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland (the District Court\u201d) seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief.\nOn November 4, 2016, the jury for the trial in the District Court found in favor of SPXCT. The verdict by the District Court is currently under appeal by BAC. We believe that we will ultimately be successful in any future judicial processes; however, to the extent we are not successful, the outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements. We are currently involved in various investigatory and remedial actions at our facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites. It is our policy to accrue for estimated losses from legal actions or claims when events exist that make the realization of the losses or expenses probable and they can be reasonably estimated. Our environmental accruals cover anticipated costs, including investigation, remediation, and operation and maintenance of clean-up sites. Accordingly, our estimates may change based on future developments, including new or changes in existing environmental laws or policies, differences in costs required to complete anticipated actions from estimates provided, future findings of investigation or remediation actions, or alteration to the expected remediation plans. We expense costs incurred to investigate and remediate environmental issues unless they extend the economic useful lives of related assets. We record liabilities when it is probable that an obligation has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. Our estimates are based primarily on investigations and remediation plans established by independent consultants, regulatory agencies and potentially responsible third parties. It is our policy to realize a change in estimates once it becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. In determining our accruals, we generally do not discount environmental accruals and do not reduce them by anticipated insurance, litigation and other recoveries. We take into account third-party indemnification from financially viable parties in determining our accruals where there is no dispute regarding the right to indemnification.\nSelf-Insured Risk Management Matters\nWe are self-insured for certain of our workers' compensation, automobile, product and general liability, disability and health costs, and we believe that we maintain adequate accruals to cover our retained liability. Our accruals for self-insurance liabilities are determined by us, are based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported, and generally are not discounted. We consider a number of factors, including third-party actuarial valuations, when making these determinations. We maintain third-party stop-loss insurance policies to cover certain liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts; however, this insurance may be insufficient or unavailable (e.g., because of insurer insolvency) to protect us against potential loss exposures. The key assumptions considered in estimating the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and the estimated costs associated with incurred but not yet reported claims include, among other things, our historical and industry claims experience, trends in health care and administrative costs, our current and future risk management programs, and historical lag studies with regard to the timing between when a claim is incurred versus when it is reported.\nLong-Term Contract Accounting\nCertain of our businesses, primarily within the Engineered Solutions reportable segment, recognize revenues and profits from long-term construction/installation contracts under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. The percentage-of-completion method requires estimates of future revenues and costs over the full term of product delivery. We measure the percentage-of-completion principally by the contract costs incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total costs for that contract at completion. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $255.5, $336.1 and $361.8 of revenues under the percentage-of-completion method, respectively.\nWe record any provision for estimated losses on uncompleted long-term contracts in the period in which the losses are determined. In the case of customer change orders for uncompleted long-term contracts, we include estimated recoveries for work performed in forecasting ultimate profitability on these contracts. Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is reasonably possible that completion costs, including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements, will be revised during the duration of a contract. These revisions to costs and income are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.\nOur estimation process for determining revenues and costs for contracts accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method is based upon (i) our historical experience, (ii) the professional judgment and knowledge of our engineers, project managers, and operations and financial professionals, and (iii) an assessment of the key underlying factors (see below) that impact the revenues and costs of our long-term contracts. Each long-term contract is unique, but typically similar enough to other contracts that we can effectively leverage our experience. As our long-term contracts generally range from nine to eighteen months in duration, we typically reassess the estimated revenues and costs of these contracts on a quarterly basis, but may reassess more often as situations warrant. We record changes in estimates of revenues and costs when identified using the cumulative catch-up method prescribed under the Revenue Recognition Topic of the Codification.\nWe believe the underlying factors used to estimate our costs to complete and percentage-of-completion are sufficiently reliable to provide a reasonable estimate of revenue and profit; however, due to the length of time over\nwhich revenues are generated and costs are incurred, along with the judgment required in developing the underlying factors, the variability of revenue and cost can be significant. Factors that may affect revenue and costs relating to long-term contracts include, but are not limited to, the following:\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Sales Price Incentives and Sales Price Escalation Clauses - Sales price incentives and sales price escalations that are reasonably assured and reasonably estimable are recorded over the performance period of the contract.

See below for our accounting policies related to claims.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Material Availability and Costs - Our estimates of material costs generally are based on existing supplier relationships, adequate availability of materials, prevailing market prices for materials, and, in some cases, long-term supplier contracts. Changes in our supplier relationships, delays in obtaining materials, or changes in material prices can have a significant impact on our cost and profitability estimates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Use of Subcontractors - Our arrangements with subcontractors are generally based on fixed prices; however, our estimates of the cost and profitability can be impacted by subcontractor delays, customer claims arising from subcontractor performance issues, or a subcontractor's inability to fulfill its obligations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Labor Costs and Anticipated Productivity Levels - Where applicable, we include the impact of labor improvements in our estimation of costs, such as in cases where we expect a favorable learning curve over the duration of the contract. In these cases, if the improvements do not materialize, costs and profitability could be adversely impacted. Additionally, to the extent we are more or less productive than originally anticipated, estimated costs and profitability may also be impacted.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Effect of Foreign Currency Fluctuations - Fluctuations between currencies in which our long-term contracts are denominated and the currencies under which contract costs are incurred can have an impact on profitability. When the impact on profitability is potentially significant, we may enter into FX forward contracts or prepay certain vendors for raw materials to manage the potential exposure. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details on our FX forward contracts.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts arise when revenues have been recorded but the amounts have not been billed under the terms of the contracts. These amounts are billed to customers upon various measures of performance, including achievement of certain milestones, completion of specified units or completion of the contract.\nWe periodically make claims against customers, suppliers and subcontractors associated with alleged non-performance and other disputes over contractual terms. Claims related to long-term contracts are recognized as additional revenues or as a reduction of costs only after we have determined that collection is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. Claims made by us may involve negotiation and, in certain cases, litigation or other dispute-resolution processes. In the event we incur litigation or other dispute-resolution costs in connection with claims, these costs are expensed as incurred, although we may seek to recover these costs. Claims against us are recognized when a loss is considered probable and amounts are reasonably estimable.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but instead are subject to annual impairment testing. We monitor the results of each of our reporting units as a means of identifying trends and/or matters that may impact their financial results and, thus, be an indicator of a potential impairment. The trends and/or matters that we specifically monitor for each of our reporting units are as follows:\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Significant variances in financial performance (e.g., revenues, earnings and cash flows) in relation to expectations and historical performance;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Significant changes in end markets or other economic factors;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Significant changes or planned changes in our use of a reporting unit's assets; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Significant changes in customer relationships and competitive conditions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units. We perform our impairment testing by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying\nvalue of the reported net assets, with such testing occurring during the fourth quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual financial planning process (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise), based primarily on events and circumstances existing as of the end of the third quarter. Fair value is generally based on the income approach using a calculation of discounted cash flows, based on the most recent financial projections for the reporting units. The revenue growth rates included in the financial projections are our best estimates based on current and forecasted market conditions, and the profit margin assumptions are projected by each reporting unit based on current cost structure and, when applicable, anticipated net cost reductions.\nThe calculation of fair value for our reporting units incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, profit margin and discount factors. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in impairment charges in future periods.\nBased on our annual goodwill impairment testing in 2017, we determined that the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value of their respective net assets by over 100%.\nWe perform our annual trademarks impairment testing during the fourth quarter, or on a more frequent basis if there are indications of potential impairment. The fair values of our trademarks are determined by applying estimated royalty rates to projected revenues, with the resulting cash flows discounted at a rate of return that reflects current market conditions. The basis for these projected revenues is the annual operating plan for each of the related businesses, which is prepared in the fourth quarter of each year.\nSee Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nDefined benefit plans cover a portion of our salaried and hourly paid employees, including certain employees in foreign countries. Additionally, domestic postretirement plans provide health and life insurance benefits for certain retirees and their dependents. We recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and actuarial gains and losses into earnings during the fourth quarter of each year, unless earlier remeasurement is required, as a component of net periodic benefit expense. The remaining components of pension/postretirement expense, primarily service and interest costs and expected return on plan assets, are recorded on a quarterly basis.\nOur pension plans have not experienced any significant impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility in the credit markets.\nThe costs and obligations associated with these plans are determined based on actuarial valuations. The critical assumptions used in determining these related expenses and obligations are discount rates and healthcare cost projections. These critical assumptions are calculated based on company data and appropriate market indicators, and are evaluated at least annually by us in consultation with outside actuaries. Other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and the rate of increase in compensation levels are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect our experience and expectations for the future. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, actual results may differ.\nThe discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date. This rate is the yield on high-quality fixed income investments at the measurement date. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. Including the effects of recognizing actuarial gains and losses into earnings as described above, a 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate for our domestic plans would have increased our 2017 pension expense by approximately $17.9, and a 50 basis point increase in the discount rate would have decreased our 2017 pension expense by approximately $16.3.\nThe trend in healthcare costs is difficult to estimate, and it can significantly impact our postretirement liabilities and costs. The healthcare cost trend rate for 2018, which is the weighted-average annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits, is 7.25%. This rate is assumed to decrease to 5.0% by 2027 and then remain at that level. Including the effects of recognizing actuarial gains and losses into earnings as described above, a 100 basis point increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would have increased our 2017 postretirement expense by approximately $1.4, and a 100 basis point decrease in the healthcare cost trend rate would have decreased our 2017 postretirement expense by approximately $1.6.\nSee Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our pension and postretirement benefit plans.\nIncome Taxes\nWe record our income taxes based on the Income Taxes Topic of the Codification, which includes an estimate of the amount of income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. We periodically assess the realizability of deferred tax assets and the adequacy of deferred tax liabilities, including the results of local, state, federal or foreign statutory tax audits or estimates and judgments used.\nRealization of deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding (i) the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, (ii) expected future taxable income, and (iii) the impact of tax planning strategies. We believe that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefit of certain deferred tax assets and, accordingly, have established a valuation allowance against them. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including past operating results, projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of and potential changes to ongoing tax planning strategies. The projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs. Although realization is not assured for the remaining deferred tax assets, we believe it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable earnings or alternative tax strategies. However, deferred tax assets could be reduced in the near term if our estimates of taxable income are significantly reduced or tax strategies are no longer viable.\nThe amount of income tax that we pay annually is dependent on various factors, including the timing of certain deductions and ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which may result in proposed adjustments. We perform reviews of our income tax positions on a quarterly basis and accrue for potential uncertain tax positions. Accruals for these uncertain tax positions are recorded based on an expectation as to the timing of when the matter will be resolved. As events change or resolutions occur, these accruals are adjusted, such as in the case of audit settlements with taxing authorities. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters.\nOur future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities due to closure of income tax examinations, statute expirations, new regulatory or judicial pronouncements, changes in tax laws, changes in projected levels of taxable income, future tax planning strategies, or other relevant events. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding our uncertain tax positions.\nParent Guarantees and Bonds Associated with Balcke D\u00fcrr\nAs discussed in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, in connection with the sale of Balcke D\u00fcrr, we remain contingently obligated under existing parent company guarantees and bank and surety bonds which totaled approximately Euro 79.0 and Euro 79.0, respectively, at the time of sale (and Euro 76.1 and Euro 47.9, respectively, at December 31, 2017). We have accounted for our contingent obligation in accordance with the Guarantees Topic of the Codification, which required that we record a liability for the estimated fair value of the parent company guarantees and the bonds in connection with the accounting for the sale of Balcke D\u00fcrr. We estimated the fair value of the parent company guarantees and bank and surety bonds considering the probability of default by Balcke D\u00fcrr and an estimate of the amount we would be obligated to pay in the event of a default (unobservable inputs - Level 3). In addition, under the related purchase agreement, Balcke D\u00fcrr provided cash collateral and mutares AG provided a partial guarantee in the event any of the parent company guarantees or bonds are called. We recorded an asset for the estimated fair value of the cash collateral provided by Balcke D\u00fcrr and the partial guarantee provided by mutares AG, with the estimated fair values based on the terms and conditions and relative risk associated with each of these securities. By way of an offset to Other expense, net,\u201d we are reducing the liability and amortizing the asset, with the reduction of the liability generally to occur at the earlier of the completion of the related underlying project milestones or the expiration of the guarantees or bonds, and the amortization of the asset to occur based on the expiration terms of each of the securities. We will continue to evaluate the adequacy of the recorded liability and will record an adjustment to the liability if we conclude that it is probable that we will be required to fund an amount greater than what is recorded. See Notes 4 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I am unable to complete your request because I am unable to identify the specific cells in the table you would like to copy.\n- Would you be able to clarify which cells you would like to copy?

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations\n(All currency and share amounts are in millions)\nThe following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto. Unless otherwise indicated, amounts provided in Item 7 pertain to continuing operations only.\nExecutive Overview\nRevenue for 2017 totaled $1,425.8, compared to $1,472.3 in 2016 (and $1,559.0 in 2015). The decrease in revenue in 2017, compared to 2016, was due to a revenue decline within our Engineered Solutions reportable segment associated primarily with a decrease in organic revenue and an aggregate reduction in revenue during 2017 of $36.9 resulting from revisions during the second and fourth quarters to the expected revenues and costs of our large power projects in South Africa. These declines were partially offset by increased revenues within our Detection and Measurement reportable segment and, to a lesser extent, our HVAC reportable segment. Revenues in 2015 included $87.3 of revenue related to the dry cooling business, which was sold at the end of the first quarter of 2016, and a reduction in revenue of $57.2 resulting from a revision to the expected revenues and costs on our large power projects in South Africa. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details on the 2017 and 2015 revenue reductions related to our large power projects in South Africa.\nIncome for our reportable segments totaled $124.9 in 2017, compared to $142.8 in 2016 (and $38.8 in 2015). During 2017, income for our reportable segments was negatively impacted by an aggregate reduction in profit of $52.8 resulting from revisions during the second and fourth quarters of 2017 to the expected revenues and costs on our large power projects in South Africa, partially offset by the impact of the revenue growth within our Detection and Measurement and HVAC reportable segments noted above and cost reductions within our Detection and Measurement and Engineered Solutions reportable segments. In 2015, income for our reportable segments was impacted by a reduction in profit of $95.0 resulting from a revision to the expected revenues and costs on our large power projects in South Africa. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details on the 2017 and 2015 profit reductions related to our large power projects in South Africa.\nOperating cash flows from (used in) continuing operations totaled $54.2 in 2017, compared to $53.4 in 2016 [and $(76.0) in 2015]. Operating cash flows from (used in) continuing operations for 2017, 2016, and 2015 were negatively impacted by cash outflows for our large power projects in South Africa of $56.5, $33.1, and $74.0, respectively, and income tax payments, net of refunds, of $22.9, $4.8, and $51.0, respectively. In addition, operating cash flows used in continuing operations in 2015 included a significant amount of disbursements for general corporate overhead costs related to a corporate structure that supported the SPX business prior to the Spin-Off.\nOther significant items impacting the financial results for 2017, 2016, and 2015 are as follows:\n2017:\n \u2022 Income Tax Matters (see Notes 1 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details) \n \u25e6 During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded an income tax benefit of $77.6 for a worthless stock deduction in the U.S. associated with our investment in a South African subsidiary. \n \u25e6 On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act\u201d) was enacted which significantly changes U.S. income tax law for businesses and individuals. As a result of the Act, we recorded provisional net income tax charges of $11.8 during the fourth quarter of 2017. \n \u2022 Gain from a Contract Settlement - During the third quarter of 2017, we settled a contract that had been suspended and then ultimately cancelled by a customer. In connection with the settlement, we: \n \u25e6 Received cash proceeds of $9.0 and other consideration; and \n \u25e6 Recorded a gain of $10.2 within our Engineered Solutions reportable segment. \n \u2022 Amendment of Senior Credit Agreement - On December 19, 2017, we amended our senior credit agreement (see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details). In connection with the amendment, we recorded: \n \u25e6 A charge of $0.9 associated with the write-off of a portion of the deferred financing costs associated with the senior credit agreement; and \n \u25e6 A gain of $2.7 related to the discontinuance of hedge accounting for the interest rate swap agreements that were entered into to hedge the interest rate risk on our then existing term loan. \n \u2022 Actuarial Gains and Losses on Pension and Postretirement Plans (see Notes 1 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details) - We recorded: \n \u25e6 An actuarial gain during the third quarter of 2017 of $2.6 related to an amendment to our postretirement plans; and \n \u25e6 Net actuarial losses of $4.2 in the fourth quarter of 2017 in connection with the annual remeasurement of our pension and postretirement plans.  2016:\n \u2022 Sale of Dry Cooling Business - On March 30, 2016, we completed the sale of the dry cooling business (see Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details). In connection with the sale, we: \n \u25e6 Received cash proceeds of $47.6; and \n \u25e6 Recorded a gain of $18.4, which includes a reclassification from Accumulated other comprehensive income\u201d of $40.4 related to foreign currency translation. \n \u2022 Sale of Balcke D\u00fcrr - On December 30, 2016, we completed the sale of Balcke D\u00fcrr (see Notes 1, 4, and 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details). \n \u25e6 The results of Balcke D\u00fcrr are presented as a discontinued operation. \n \u25e6 In connection with the sale, we: \n \u25aa Received cash proceeds of less than $0.1; \n \u25aa Left $21.1 of cash in the business at the time of the sale and provided the buyer a non-interest bearing loan of $9.1, payable in installments at the end of 2018 and 2019; and \n \u25aa Recorded a net loss of $78.6 to Gain (loss) on disposition of discontinued operations, net of tax\u201d within our consolidated statement of operations for 2016. \n \u2022 Intangible Asset Impairment Charges - We recorded impairment charges of $30.1 related to the intangible assets of our Heat Transfer business, which included $23.9 for definite-lived intangible assets and $6.2 for indefinite-lived intangible assets (see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details). \n \u2022 Actuarial Losses on Pension and Postretirement Plans (see Notes 1 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details) - During the year, we recorded net actuarial losses of $12.0.  2015:\n \u2022 Spin-Off of SPX FLOW - On September 26, 2015, we completed the Spin-Off of SPX FLOW (see Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details). \n \u25e6 The results of SPX FLOW are presented as a discontinued operation. \n \u25e6 Our 2015 results from continuing operations include a significant amount of general and administrative costs associated with corporate employees and other corporate support that transferred to SPX FLOW at the time of the Spin-Off. \n \u2022 Actuarial Losses on Pension and Postretirement Plans (see Notes 1 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details) - During the year, we recorded net actuarial losses of $21.0 and a curtailment gain of $5.1. \nResults of Continuing Operations\nCyclicality of End Markets, Seasonality and Competition-The financial results of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries in which they operate and end markets in which they serve. In addition, certain of our businesses have seasonal fluctuations. For example, our heating and ventilation businesses tend to be stronger in the third and fourth quarters, as customer buying habits are driven largely by seasonal weather patterns. In aggregate, our businesses generally tend to be stronger in the second half of the year.\nAlthough our businesses operate in highly competitive markets, our competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by segment since none of our competitors offer all the same product lines or serve all the same markets as we do. In addition, specific reliable comparative figures are not available for many of our competitors. In most product groups, competition comes from numerous concerns, both large and small. The principal methods of competition are service, product performance, technical innovation and price. These methods vary with the type of product sold. We believe we compete effectively on the basis of each of these factors.\nNon-GAAP Measures - Organic revenue growth (decline) presented herein is defined as revenue growth (decline) excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions/divestitures, and the impact of the revenue reduction that resulted from the second and fourth quarter 2017 and third quarter 2015 revisions to the expected revenues and profits on our large power projects in South Africa of $13.5, $23.4 and $57.2, respectively. We believe this metric is a useful financial measure for investors in evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented, as, when read in conjunction with our revenues, it presents a useful tool to evaluate our ongoing operations and provides investors with a tool they can use to evaluate our management of assets held from period to period. In addition, organic revenue\ngrowth (decline) is one of the factors we use in internal evaluations of the overall performance of our business. This metric, however, is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d), should not be considered a substitute for net revenue growth (decline) as determined in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nThe following table provides selected financial information for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, including the reconciliation of organic revenue decline to net revenue decline:\n\n___________________________________________________________________\n * Not meaningful for comparison purposes.  Revenues - For 2017, the decrease in revenues, compared to 2016, was due, in part, to a decline in organic revenue within our Engineered Solutions reportable segment, partially offset by increases in organic revenue within our Detection and Measurement reportable segment and, to a lesser extent, our HVAC reportable segment. In addition, revenues were negatively impacted by (i) an aggregate reduction in revenue of $36.9 resulting from revisions during the second and fourth quarters of 2017 to the expected revenues and costs on our large power projects in South Africa and (ii) the impact of the sale of the dry cooling business at the end of the first quarter of 2016. These declines in revenue were partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar during 2017. See Results of Reportable Segments\u201d for additional details.\nFor 2016, the decrease in revenues, compared to 2015, was due to the impact of the sale of the dry cooling business at the end of the first quarter of 2016, a decline in organic revenue, and, to a lesser extent, a stronger U.S. dollar in 2016. These decreases were offset partially by the impact of a reduction in revenues of $57.2 during the third quarter of 2015 resulting from a revision to the expected revenues and costs on our large power projects in South Africa. The decline in organic revenue was due primarily to lower sales of process cooling products within our Engineered Solutions reportable segment. See Results of Reportable Segments\u201d for additional details.\nGross Profit - For 2017, the decrease in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenues, compared to 2016, was due primarily to an aggregate reduction in gross profit of $52.8 resulting from revisions during the second\nand fourth quarters of 2017 to the expected revenues and costs of our large power projects in South Africa, partially offset by the impact of the organic revenue growth in our Detection and Measurement reportable segment noted above.\nThe increase in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenue in 2016, compared to 2015, was due primarily to a reduction in gross profit of $95.0 during the third quarter of 2015 associated with a revision to the expected revenues and costs of our large power projects in South Africa. In addition, during 2016, gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenues were impacted favorably by cost reductions and improved operating efficiency at the businesses within our HVAC reportable segment and our power transformer business.\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expense - For 2017, the decrease in SG&A expense, compared to 2016, was due primarily to (i) a decline in actuarial losses for our pension and postretirement plans (net losses of $1.6 in 2017, compared to net losses of $12.0 in 2016 - see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further details), (ii) the impact of the sale of the dry cooling business at the end of the first quarter of 2016, and (iii) cost reductions within our Detection and Measurement and Engineered Solutions reportable segments over the past year.\nFor 2016, the decrease in SG&A expense, compared to 2015, was due primarily to declines in corporate expense of $61.7, pension and postretirement expense of $3.2, and long-term incentive compensation expense of $20.2. See Results of Reportable Segments\u201d for additional details on corporate expense, pension and postretirement expense, and long-term incentive compensation expense.\nIntangible Amortization - For 2017, the decline in intangible amortization, compared to 2016, was primarily due to the impact of the $23.9 impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 associated with our Heat Transfer business's definite-lived intangible assets.\nFor 2016, the decline in intangible amortization, compared to 2015, was primarily the result of (i) discontinuing amortization on the long-term assets of our dry cooling business in connection with classifying the business's assets and liabilities as held for sale,\u201d effective December 31, 2015, and (ii) the impact of the $23.9 impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 associated with our Heat Transfer business's definite-lived intangible assets. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details on the impairment charge recorded for the definite-lived intangible assets of our Heat Transfer business.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets - During 2016, we recorded impairment charges of $30.1 related to the intangible assets of our Heat Transfer business, which included $23.9 for definite-lived intangible assets and $6.2 for indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nSee Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of impairment charges.\nSpecial Charges, Net - Special charges, net, related primarily to restructuring initiatives to consolidate manufacturing, distribution, sales and administrative facilities, reduce workforce, and rationalize certain product lines. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for the details of actions taken in 2017, 2016 and 2015. The components of special charges, net, are as follows:\n\nGain on Contract Settlement - During the third quarter of 2017, we settled a contract that had been suspended and then ultimately cancelled by a customer for cash proceeds of $9.0 and other consideration. In connection with the settlement, we recorded a gain of $10.2 during the quarter.\nGain on Sale of Dry Cooling Business - On March 30, 2016, we completed the sale of our dry cooling business resulting in a gain of $18.4. See Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\nOther Expense, Net - Other expense, net, for 2017 was composed primarily of charges of $3.5 associated with asbestos product liability matters, foreign currency transaction losses of $2.9, and losses on currency forward embedded derivatives ( FX embedded derivatives\u201d) of $0.6, partially offset by a gain of $2.7 associated with the\ndiscontinuance of hedge accounting on our interest rate swap agreements, income from company-owned life insurance policies of $1.7, and equity earnings in joint ventures of $0.7.\nOther expense, net, for 2016 was composed primarily of charges of $4.2 associated with asbestos product liability matters, losses on foreign currency forward contracts ( FX forward contracts\u201d) of $5.1, and losses on FX embedded derivatives of $1.2. These amounts were offset partially by foreign currency transaction gains of $3.9, income from company-owned life insurance policies of $2.8, equity earnings in joint ventures of $1.5, income associated with transition services provided in connection with the sale of the dry cooling business of $0.9, and gains on asset sales of $0.9.\nOther expense, net, for 2015 was composed primarily of charges of $8.0 associated with asbestos product liability matters, foreign currency transaction losses of $7.4, and losses on FX forward contracts of $7.7, partially offset by gains of $6.5 on FX embedded derivatives, income from company-owned life insurance policies of $3.8, and equity earnings in joint ventures of $1.5.\nInterest Expense, Net - Interest expense, net, includes both interest expense and interest income. The increase in interest expense, net, during 2017, compared to 2016, was primarily a result of a higher weighted-average interest rate and higher average debt balances during 2017, compared to 2016.\nThe decrease in interest expense, net, during 2016, compared to 2015, was primarily the result of a decline in interest expense due to lower average debt balances during 2016.\nLoss on Amendment/Refinancing of Senior Credit Agreement - During the fourth quarter of 2017, we amended our senior credit agreement. In connection with the amendment, we recorded a charge of $0.9 during 2017, which consisted of the write-off of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs related to our senior credit facilities.\nIn the third quarter of 2016, we reduced the issuance capacity under our foreign credit facilities by $200.0. In connection with such reduction, we recorded a charge of $1.3 associated with the write-off of the unamortized deferred financing costs related to the $200.0 of previously available issuance capacity.\nIn the third quarter of 2015, we refinanced our senior credit facilities in connection with the Spin-Off. As a result of the refinancing, we recorded a charge of $1.4 during 2015, which consisted of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to our prior senior credit facilities.\nIncome Taxes - During 2017, we recorded an income tax benefit of $47.9 on $36.1 of pre-tax income from continuing operations, resulting in an effective tax rate of (132.7)%. The most significant items impacting the income tax benefit for 2017 were a tax benefit of $77.6 related to a worthless stock deduction in the U.S. associated with our investment in a South African subsidiary and $4.9 of tax benefits related to various audit settlements, statute expirations, and other adjustments to liabilities for uncertain tax positions, partially offset by $11.8 of net tax charges associated with the impact of the new tax regulations in the U.S. previously discussed and foreign losses generated during the year of $68.2 for which no foreign tax benefit was recognized as future realization of a foreign tax benefit is considered unlikely.\nDuring 2016, we recorded an income tax provision of $9.1 on $39.4 of a pre-tax income from continuing operations, resulting in an effective tax rate of 23.1%. The most significant items impacting the effective tax rate for 2016 were the $0.3 of income taxes provided in connection with the $18.4 gain that was recorded on the sale of the dry cooling business, $13.7 of foreign losses generated during the period for which no tax benefit was recognized as future realization of any such foreign tax benefit is considered unlikely, and $2.4 of tax benefits related to various audit settlements, statute expirations, and other adjustments to liabilities for uncertain tax positions.\nDuring 2015, we recorded an income tax benefit of $2.7 on $154.3 of a pre-tax loss from continuing operations, resulting in an effective tax rate of 1.7%. The most significant item impacting the effective tax rate for 2015 was the effects of approximately $139.0 of foreign losses generated during the year for which no tax benefit was recognized, as future realization of such foreign tax benefit is considered unlikely. In addition, we incurred foreign tax charges of $3.7 related to the Spin-Off and the reorganization actions undertaken to facilitate the Spin-Off and $3.4 of net charges related to various audit settlements, statute expirations, and other adjustments to liabilities for uncertain tax positions.\nResults of Discontinued Operations\nSale of Balcke D\u00fcrr Business\nAs indicated in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, we completed the sale of Balcke D\u00fcrr on December 30, 2016 for cash proceeds of less than $0.1. In addition, we left $21.1 of cash in Balcke D\u00fcrr at the time of the sale and provided the buyer with a non-interest bearing loan of $9.1, payable in installments due at the end of 2018 and 2019. In connection with the sale, we recorded a net loss of $78.6 to Gain (loss) on disposition of discontinued operations, net of tax\u201d within our consolidated statement of operations for 2016.\nThe results of Balcke D\u00fcrr are presented as a discontinued operation. Major classes of line items constituting pre-tax loss and after-tax loss of Balcke D\u00fcrr for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 are shown below:\n\nThe following table presents selected financial information for Balcke D\u00fcrr that is included within discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\n\nDuring 2017, we reduced the net loss associated with the sale of Balcke D\u00fcrr by $6.8. The reduction was comprised of an additional income tax benefit recorded for the sale of $9.4, partially offset by the impact of adjustments to liabilities retained in connection with the sale and certain other adjustments.\nSpin-Off of SPX FLOW\nAs indicated in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, we completed the Spin-Off of SPX FLOW on September 26, 2015. The results of SPX FLOW are reflected as a discontinued operation within our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. Major classes of line items constituting pre-tax income and after-tax income of SPX FLOW for the year ended December 31, 2015 (1) are shown below:\n\n (1) Represents financial results for SPX FLOW through the date of Spin-Off (i.e., the nine months ended September 26, 2015), except for a revision to increase the income tax provision by $1.4 that was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2015. \n (2) Includes $30.8 of professional fees and other costs that were incurred in connection with the Spin-Off.  The following table presents selected financial information for SPX FLOW that is included within discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2015(1):\n\n(1) Represents amounts for SPX FLOW through the date of Spin-Off (i.e., the nine months ended September 26, 2015).\nOther Discontinued Operations Activity\nIn addition to the businesses discussed above, we recognized net losses of $1.5, $2.7 and $5.2 during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, resulting from adjustments to gains/losses on dispositions of businesses discontinued prior to 2015.\nChanges in estimates associated with liabilities retained in connection with a business divestiture (e.g., income taxes) may occur. As a result, it is possible that the resulting gains/losses on these and other previous divestitures may be materially adjusted in subsequent periods.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, results of operations from our businesses reported as discontinued operations were as follows:\n\n (1) For SPX FLOW, represents financial results through the date of Spin-Off (i.e., the nine months ended September 26, 2015), except for a revision to increase the income tax provision by $1.4 that was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2015.  Other Dispositions\nSale of Dry Cooling Business\nAs indicated in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, on November 20, 2015, we entered into an agreement for the sale of our dry cooling business. On March 30, 2016, we completed the sale of our dry cooling business for cash proceeds for $47.6 (net of cash transferred with the business of $3.0). In connection with the sale, we recorded a gain of $18.4.\nResults of Reportable Segments\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes. These results exclude the operating results of discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of each of our reportable segments.\nNon-GAAP Measures - Throughout the following discussion of reportable segments, we use organic revenue\u201d growth (decline) to facilitate explanation of the operating performance of our segments. Organic revenue growth (decline) is a non-GAAP financial measure, and is not a substitute for net revenue growth (decline). Refer to the explanation of this measure and purpose of use by management under Results of Continuing Operations - Non-GAAP Measures.\u201d\nHVAC Reportable Segment\n\nRevenues - For 2017, the increase in revenues, compared to 2016, was due to the increase in organic revenue. The increase in organic revenue was due primarily to an increase in sales of cooling products and heating and ventilation products, partially offset by a decline in sales of boiler products.\nFor 2016, the decrease in revenues, compared to 2015, was due to a decline in organic revenue and, to a lesser extent, the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar during 2016. The organic revenue decline primarily was the result of lower sales of heating and ventilation products.\nIncome - For 2017, income and margin decreased, compared to 2016, primarily as a result of a less profitable sales mix associated with the segment's cooling and boiler products as well as lower absorption of fixed costs within the boiler products business due to the lower sales volumes noted above.\nFor 2016, margin increased, compared to 2015, primarily as a result of improved operating efficiency and a more profitable sales mix within the segment's heating and ventilation products businesses.\nBacklog - The segment had backlog of $41.4 and $28.3 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Approximately 99% of the segment's backlog as of December 31, 2017 is expected to be recognized as revenue during 2018.\nDetection and Measurement Reportable Segment\n\nRevenues - For 2017, the increase in revenues, compared to 2016, was due to an increase in organic revenue. The increase in organic revenue was the result of an increase in sales for all of the primary product lines within the segment.\nFor 2016, the decrease in revenues, compared to 2015, was due to a stronger U.S. dollar in 2016 and, to a lesser extent, a decline in organic revenue. The decline in organic revenue was due primarily to a decrease in sales of communication technologies products, generally offset by increases in sales of bus fare collection systems and specialty lighting products.\nIncome - For 2017, the increase in income and margin, compared to 2016, was due primarily to the revenue increase noted above and lower SG&A expense resulting from cost reductions within our bus fare collection systems' and communication technologies' businesses.\nFor 2016, the decrease in income, compared to 2015, was primarily due to the revenue decline noted above.\nBacklog - The segment had backlog of $54.0 and $53.6 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Approximately 65% of the segment's backlog as of December 31, 2017 is expected to be recognized as revenue during 2018.\nEngineered Solutions Reportable Segment\n\n___________________________________________________________________\n * Not meaningful for comparison purposes.  Revenues - For 2017, the decrease in revenues, compared to 2016, was due primarily to a decline in organic revenue, partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar versus the South African Rand during 2017. The decline in organic revenue was the result of lower sales related to the segment's large power projects in South Africa, as these projects generally are in the latter stages of completion, as well as lower sales of power transformers and process cooling products. The decrease in power transformer sales was due primarily to the timing of shipments. In addition, our process cooling business has been impacted by a shift in its sales model, whereby it is now focused more on high-margin components and services and less on lower-margin large projects. In addition, the decrease in revenues compared to the same period in 2016, resulted from an aggregate reduction in revenue of $36.9 related to revisions during the second and fourth quarters of 2017 to the expected revenues and costs on the segment's large power projects in South Africa and the impact of the sale of the dry cooling business at the end of the first quarter of 2016.\nFor 2016, the decrease in revenues, compared to 2015, was due primarily to the impact of the sale of the dry cooling business at the end of the first quarter of 2016, a decline in organic revenue, and, to a lesser extent, the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar in 2016, partially offset by the impact of a reduction in revenues of $57.2 during the third quarter of 2015 resulting from a revision to the expected revenues and costs on the segment's large power projects in South Africa. The decline in organic revenues was due primarily to lower sales of process cooling products.\nIncome - For 2017, the decrease in profit and margin, compared to 2016, was due primarily to an aggregate reduction in profit of $52.8 associated with revisions during the second and fourth quarters of 2017 to the expected revenues and costs of the segment's large power projects in South Africa, partially offset by a $10.2 gain recorded during the third quarter of 2017 resulting from the settlement of a contract that had been suspended and then ultimately cancelled by a customer. In addition, income and margin in 2017, compared to 2016, were favorably impacted by cost reductions at the segment's Heat Transfer business resulting from restructuring actions that were implemented in 2016 and the sale of the dry cooling business, which generated losses in 2016 prior to its sale.\nFor 2016, the increase in profit and margin, compared to 2015, was due primarily to the fact that the segment's results for 2015 included a reduction in profit of $95.0 during the third quarter of 2015 resulting from a revision to the expected revenues and costs on the segment's large power projects in South Africa. During 2016, income and margin for the segment's power transformer business increased as a result of improved operating efficiency. However, these increases were offset partially by lower profitability from process cooling products resulting primarily from the decline in revenue noted above.\nBacklog - The segment had backlog of $434.0 and $416.7 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Approximately 83% of the segment's backlog as of December 31, 2017 is expected to be recognized as revenue during 2018.\nCorporate Expense and Other Expense\n\nCorporate Expense - Corporate expense generally relates to the cost of our Charlotte, NC corporate headquarters. Prior to the Spin-Off, corporate expense also included costs of our Asia Pacific center in Shanghai, China, which was part of the Spin-Off, costs that were previously allocated to the Flow Business that do not meet the requirements to be presented within discontinued operations, and the cost of corporate employees who became employees of SPX FLOW at the time of the Spin-Off. The increase in corporate expense in 2017, compared to 2016, was due primarily to higher incentive compensation expense, as well as higher professional fees. The decrease in corporate expense in 2016, compared to 2015, was due primarily to the elimination of costs in connection with the Spin-Off, including the cost of corporate employees who became employees of SPX FLOW.\nPension and Postretirement Expense - Pension and postretirement expense represents our consolidated expense, which we do not allocate for segment reporting purposes. The decrease in pension and postretirement expense in 2017, compared to 2016, was due primarily to a decline in actuarial losses, as net actuarial losses totaled $1.6 in 2017 and $12.0 in 2016. Actuarial losses in 2017 included net charges of $4.2 related to our fourth quarter remeasurement of our plans' assets and liabilities, partially offset by an actuarial gain of $2.6 recorded in the third quarter of 2017 associated with the remeasurement of the unfunded liability related to certain postretirement benefits. The fourth quarter 2017 net charges resulted primarily from lower discount rates applied to our plans' projected benefit obligations, partially offset by better than expected returns on our plans' assets.\nThe decrease in pension and postretirement expense in 2016, compared to 2015, was due to a decline in actuarial losses, as actuarial losses in 2016 totaled $12.0 compared to $15.9 in 2015. Actuarial losses for 2016 and 2015 resulted primarily from our fourth quarter remeasurement of our plan's assets and liabilities, with the resulting charges for the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2015 totaling $10.2 and $9.6, respectively. The fourth quarter 2016 charges resulted primarily from lower discount rates applied to our plans' projected benefit obligations, while the fourth quarter 2015 charges resulted primarily from lower than expected returns on plan assets. Actuarial losses for 2016 also included charges of $1.8 associated with the second quarter 2016 remeasurement of the assets and liabilities of the SPX U.S. Pension Plan (the U.S. Plan\u201d) and Supplemental Individual Account Retirement Plan ( SIARP\u201d) in connection with lump-sum payments that were made by these plans during the quarter. Actuarial losses for 2015 also included charges of $11.4 associated with the third quarter 2015 remeasurement of the assets and liabilities of the U.S. Plan and SIARP in connection with an amendment to these plans to freeze all benefits of active non-union participants. This amendment also resulted in a curtailment gain of $5.1 during the third quarter of 2015.\nSee Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further details on our pension and postretirement plans.\nLong-term Incentive Compensation Expense - The increase in long-term incentive compensation expense during 2017, compared to the respective period in 2016, was due primarily to additional charges of $1.6 in 2017 associated with certain of our long-term cash-awards, as we now expect to exceed the three-year segment income performance target required of these awards. The decrease in long-term incentive compensation expense in 2016, compared to 2015, was due primarily to the fact that the 2015 amount included $21.6 of costs related to corporate employees who became employees of SPX FLOW at the time of the Spin-Off or retired in connection with the Spin-Off.\nSee Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further details on our long-term incentive compensation plans.\nLiquidity and Financial Condition\nListed below are the cash flows from (used in) operating, investing and financing activities, and discontinued operations, as well as the net change in cash and equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\n\n2017 Compared to 2016\nOperating Activities - The increase in cash flows from operating activities, compared to 2016, was due primarily to improved operating cash flows across our businesses related to improved profitability and reductions in working capital, partially offset by a year-over-year increase in net income tax payments ($22.9 in 2017, compared to $4.8 in 2016) and an increase in cash outflows associated with our large power projects in South Africa ($56.5 in 2017, compared to $33.1 in 2016).\nInvesting Activities - Cash flows used in investing activities for 2017 were comprised of capital expenditures of $11.0 and an increase in restricted cash of $0.3. Cash flows from investing activities for 2016 related to proceeds from asset sales of $48.1 (including proceeds from the sale of the dry cooling business of $47.6), partially offset by capital expenditures of $11.7.\nFinancing Activities - During 2017, net cash flows used in financing activities primarily related to financing fees of $3.6 paid in connection with the December 2017 amendment of our senior credit agreement and net repayments under our various debt instruments of $1.3. During 2016, net cash flows used in financing activities primarily related to net repayments of debt of $18.9.\nDiscontinued Operations - Cash flows used in discontinued operations for 2017 related to disbursements for liabilities retained in connection with dispositions, while cash flows used in discontinued operations during 2016 related primarily to the operations of our Balcke D\u00fcrr business and the cash disposed of in connection with the sale of Balcke D\u00fcrr.\nChange in Cash and Equivalents due to Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates - Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on our cash and equivalents during 2017 and 2016.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nOperating Activities - The increase in cash flows from operating activities during 2016, compared to 2015, was due primarily to the fact that cash flows used in operating activities during 2015 included disbursements for general corporate overhead costs related to a corporate structure that supported the SPX business prior to the Spin-Off. As previously noted, a significant portion of this corporate structure transferred to SPX FLOW at the time of the Spin-Off and, thus, was no longer part of our company during 2016. In addition, operating cash flows associated with our businesses increased during 2016, compared to 2015, primarily as a result of the timing of cash receipts on certain long-term projects.\nInvesting Activities - Cash flows from investing activities for 2016 related to proceeds from asset sales of $48.1 (including proceeds from the sale of the dry cooling business of $47.6), partially offset by capital expenditures of $11.7. Cash flows used in investing activities during 2015 related to capital expenditures of $16.0, partially offset by proceeds from asset sales of $2.0.\nFinancing Activities - During 2016, net cash flows used in financing activities primarily related to net repayments of debt of $18.9. During 2015, net cash flows used in financing activities primarily related to the cash dividend to SPX\nFLOW in connection with the Spin-Off of $208.6 and dividends paid of $45.9, partially offset by net borrowings under our senior credit facilities of $97.0.\nDiscontinued Operations - Cash flows used in discontinued operations during 2016 related primarily to the operations of our Balcke D\u00fcrr business and the cash disposed of in connection with the sale of Balcke D\u00fcrr, while cash flows used in discontinued operations during 2015 related primarily to the cash flows associated with the FLOW Business.\nChange in Cash and Equivalents due to Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates - Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on our cash and equivalents during 2016. The decrease in cash and equivalents due to foreign currency exchange rates for 2015 reflected primarily a reduction in U.S. dollar equivalent balances of our Euro-denominated cash and equivalents as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro during the period.\nBorrowings\nThe following summarizes our debt activity (both current and non-current) for the year ended December 31, 2017:\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n (1) As noted below, we amended our senior credit agreement on December 19, 2017 and proceeds of $350.0 were made available by way of a new term loan facility, with $328.1 utilized to repay, in full, amounts outstanding under the then-existing term loan facility \n (2) The new term loan is repayable in quarterly installments of 1.25% of the initial loan amount of $350.0, beginning in the first quarter of 2019, with the remaining balance payable in full on December 19, 2022. Balances are net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $2.3 and $1.6 at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. \n (3) Under this arrangement, we can borrow, on a continuous basis, up to $50.0, as available. At December 31, 2017, we had $33.3 of available borrowing capacity under this facility. \n (4) Primarily includes capital lease obligations of $2.1 and $1.7, balances under purchase card programs of $2.8 and $3.9, borrowings under a line of credit in South Africa of $0.0 and $10.2, and borrowings under a line of credit in China of $4.1 and $0.0, at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The purchase card program allows for payment beyond the normal payment terms for goods and services acquired under the program. As this arrangement extends the payment of these purchases beyond their normal payment terms through third-party lending institutions, we have classified these amounts as short-term debt. \n (5) Other\u201d primarily includes debt assumed, foreign currency translation on any debt instruments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the new term loan, and the impact of amortization of debt issuance costs associated with the term loan.  Maturities of long-term debt payable during each of the five years subsequent to December 31, 2017 are $0.5, $18.0, $18.0, $17.9 and $297.7, respectively.\nSenior Credit Facilities\nOn December 19, 2017, we amended our senior credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) to, among other things, extend the term of each facility under the Credit Agreement (with the aggregate of each facility comprising the Senior Credit Facilities\u201d) and provide for committed senior secured financing with an aggregate amount of $900.0, consisting of the following (each with the final maturity of December 19, 2022):\n \u2022 A new term loan facility in an aggregate principle amount of $350.0; \n \u2022 A domestic revolving credit facility, available for loans and letters of credit, in an aggregate principal amount up to $200.0; \n \u2022 A global revolving credit facility, available for loans in Euros, GBP and other currencies, in an aggregate principal amount up to the equivalent of $150.0; \n \u2022 A participation foreign credit instrument facility, available for performance letters of credit and guarantees, in an aggregate principal amount up to the equivalent of $145.0 (previously $175.0); and \n \u2022 A bilateral foreign credit instrument facility, available for performance letters of credit and guarantees, in an aggregate principal amount up to the equivalent of $55.0 (previously $125.0). \nThe above amendment of our Credit Agreement also:\n \u2022 Adjusts the maximum aggregate amount of additional commitments we may seek, without consent of existing lenders, to add an incremental term loan facility and/or increase the commitments in respect of the domestic revolving credit facility, the global revolving credit facility, the participation foreign credit instrument facility, and/or the bilateral foreign credit instrument facility, to (i) the greater of (A) $200.0 or (B) our Consolidated EBITDA for the preceding four fiscal quarters, plus (ii) an amount equal to all voluntary prepayments of the term loan facility and the voluntary prepayments accompanied by permanent commitment reductions of revolving credit facilities and foreign credit instrument facilities, plus (iii) an unlimited amount so long as, immediately after giving effect thereto, our Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio for the prior four fiscal quarters does not exceed 2.75 to 1.00 (with the provisions described in clauses (ii) and (iii) being essentially unchanged from the previous agreement); \n \u2022 Permits unlimited investments, capital stock repurchases and dividends, and prepayments of subordinated debt if our Consolidated Leverage Ratio, after giving pro forma effect to such payments, is less than 2.75 to 1.00 (2.50 to 1.00 prior to the amendment); \n \u2022 Increases the Consolidated Leverage Ratio that we are required to maintain as of the last day of any fiscal quarter to not more than 3.50 to 1.00 (or 4.00 to 1.00 for the four fiscal quarters after certain permitted acquisitions) and included certain add-backs in the definition of consolidated EBITDA used in determining such ratio; and \n \u2022 Adjusts per annum fees charged and the interest rate margins applicable to Eurodollar and alternate base rate loans, in each case based on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, to be as follows: \n\nWe are the borrower under each of the above facilities, and certain of our foreign subsidiaries are (and we may designate other foreign subsidiaries to be) borrowers under the global revolving credit facility and the foreign credit instrument facilities. All borrowings and other extensions of credit under the Credit Agreement are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including absence of defaults and accuracy in material respects of representations and warranties.\nThe letters of credit under the domestic revolving credit facility are stand-by letters of credit requested by SPX on behalf of any of our subsidiaries or certain joint ventures. The foreign credit instrument facility is used to issue foreign credit instruments, including bank undertakings to support our foreign operations.\nThe interest rates applicable to loans under the Credit Agreement are, at our option, equal to either (i) an alternate base rate (the highest of (a) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5%, (b) the prime rate of Bank of America, N.A., and (c) the one-month LIBOR rate plus 1.0%) or (ii) a reserve-adjusted LIBOR rate for dollars (Eurodollars) plus, in each case, an applicable margin percentage as previously discussed, which varies based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement generally as the ratio of consolidated total debt (excluding the face amount of undrawn letters of credit, bank undertakings and analogous instruments and net of cash and cash equivalents not to exceed $150.0) at the date of determination to consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the four fiscal quarters ended most recently before such date). We may elect interest periods of one, two, three or six months (and, if consented to by all relevant lenders, twelve months) for Eurodollar borrowings.\nThe weighted-average interest rate of outstanding borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities was approximately 3.2% at December 31, 2017.\nThe fees and bilateral foreign credit commitments are as specified above for foreign credit commitments unless otherwise agreed with the bilateral foreign", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations\n(All currency and share amounts are in millions)\nThe following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto. Unless otherwise indicated, amounts provided in Item 7 pertain to continuing operations only.\nExecutive Overview\nRevenue for 2017 totaled $1,425.8, compared to $1,472.3 in 2016 (and $1,559.0 in 2015). The decrease in revenue in 2017, compared to 2016, was due to a revenue decline within our Engineered Solutions reportable segment associated primarily with a decrease in organic revenue and an aggregate reduction in revenue during 2017 of $36.9 resulting from revisions during the second and fourth quarters to the expected revenues and costs of our large power projects in South Africa. These declines were partially offset by increased revenues within our Detection and Measurement reportable segment and, to a lesser extent, our HVAC reportable segment. Revenues in 2015 included $87.3 of revenue related to the dry cooling business, which was sold at the end of the first quarter of 2016, and a reduction in revenue of $57.2 resulting from a revision to the expected revenues and costs on our large power projects in South Africa. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details on the 2017 and 2015 revenue reductions related to our large power projects in South Africa.\nIncome for our reportable segments totaled $124.9 in 2017, compared to $142.8 in 2016 (and $38.8 in 2015). During 2017, income for our reportable segments was negatively impacted by an aggregate reduction in profit of $52.8 resulting from revisions during the second and fourth quarters of 2017 to the expected revenues and costs on our large power projects in South Africa, partially offset by the impact of the revenue growth within our Detection and Measurement and HVAC reportable segments noted above and cost reductions within our Detection and Measurement and Engineered Solutions reportable segments. In 2015, income for our reportable segments was impacted by a reduction in profit of $95.0 resulting from a revision to the expected revenues and costs on our large power projects in South Africa. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details on the 2017 and 2015 profit reductions related to our large power projects in South Africa.\nOperating cash flows from (used in) continuing operations totaled $54.2 in 2017, compared to $53.4 in 2016 [and $(76.0) in 2015]. Operating cash flows from (used in) continuing operations for 2017, 2016, and 2015 were negatively impacted by cash outflows for our large power projects in South Africa of $56.5, $33.1, and $74.0, respectively, and income tax payments, net of refunds, of $22.9, $4.8, and $51.0, respectively. In addition, operating cash flows used in continuing operations in 2015 included a significant amount of disbursements for general corporate overhead costs related to a corporate structure that supported the SPX business prior to the Spin-Off.\nOther significant items impacting the financial results for 2017, 2016, and 2015 are as follows:\n2017:\n \u2022 Income Tax Matters (see Notes 1 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details) \n \u25e6 During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded an income tax benefit of $77.6 for a worthless stock deduction in the U.S. associated with our investment in a South African subsidiary. \n \u25e6 On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act\u201d) was enacted which significantly changes U.S. income tax law for businesses and individuals. As a result of the Act, we recorded provisional net income tax charges of $11.8 during the fourth quarter of 2017. \n \u2022 Gain from a Contract Settlement - During the third quarter of 2017, we settled a contract that had been suspended and then ultimately cancelled by a customer. In connection with the settlement, we: \n \u25e6 Received cash proceeds of $9.0 and other consideration; and \n \u25e6 Recorded a gain of $10.2 within our Engineered Solutions reportable segment. \n \u2022 Amendment of Senior Credit Agreement - On December 19, 2017, we amended our senior credit agreement (see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details). In connection with the amendment, we recorded: \n \u25e6 A charge of $0.9 associated with the write-off of a portion of the deferred financing costs associated with the senior credit agreement; and \n \u25e6 A gain of $2.7 related to the discontinuance of hedge accounting for the interest rate swap agreements that were entered into to hedge the interest rate risk on our then existing term loan. \n \u2022 Actuarial Gains and Losses on Pension and Postretirement Plans (see Notes 1 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details) - We recorded: \n \u25e6 An actuarial gain during the third quarter of 2017 of $2.6 related to an amendment to our postretirement plans; and \n \u25e6 Net actuarial losses of $4.2 in the fourth quarter of 2017 in connection with the annual remeasurement of our pension and postretirement plans.  2016:\n \u2022 Sale of Dry Cooling Business - On March 30, 2016, we completed the sale of the dry cooling business (see Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details). In connection with the sale, we: \n \u25e6 Received cash proceeds of $47.6; and \n \u25e6 Recorded a gain of $18.4, which includes a reclassification from Accumulated other comprehensive income\u201d of $40.4 related to foreign currency translation. \n \u2022 Sale of Balcke D\u00fcrr - On December 30, 2016, we completed the sale of Balcke D\u00fcrr (see Notes 1, 4, and 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details). \n \u25e6 The results of Balcke D\u00fcrr are presented as a discontinued operation. \n \u25e6 In connection with the sale, we: \n \u25aa Received cash proceeds of less than $0.1; \n \u25aa Left $21.1 of cash in the business at the time of the sale and provided the buyer a non-interest bearing loan of $9.1, payable in installments at the end of 2018 and 2019; and \n \u25aa Recorded a net loss of $78.6 to Gain (loss) on disposition of discontinued operations, net of tax\u201d within our consolidated statement of operations for 2016. \n \u2022 Intangible Asset Impairment Charges - We recorded impairment charges of $30.1 related to the intangible assets of our Heat Transfer business, which included $23.9 for definite-lived intangible assets and $6.2 for indefinite-lived intangible assets (see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details). \n \u2022 Actuarial Losses on Pension and Postretirement Plans (see Notes 1 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details) - During the year, we recorded net actuarial losses of $12.0.  2015:\n \u2022 Spin-Off of SPX FLOW - On September 26, 2015, we completed the Spin-Off of SPX FLOW (see Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details). \n \u25e6 The results of SPX FLOW are presented as a discontinued operation. \n \u25e6 Our 2015 results from continuing operations include a significant amount of general and administrative costs associated with corporate employees and other corporate support that transferred to SPX FLOW at the time of the Spin-Off. \n \u2022 Actuarial Losses on Pension and Postretirement Plans (see Notes 1 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details) - During the year, we recorded net actuarial losses of $21.0 and a curtailment gain of $5.1. \nResults of Continuing Operations\nCyclicality of End Markets, Seasonality and Competition-The financial results of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries in which they operate and end markets in which they serve. In addition, certain of our businesses have seasonal fluctuations. For example, our heating and ventilation businesses tend to be stronger in the third and fourth quarters, as customer buying habits are driven largely by seasonal weather patterns. In aggregate, our businesses generally tend to be stronger in the second half of the year.\nAlthough our businesses operate in highly competitive markets, our competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by segment since none of our competitors offer all the same product lines or serve all the same markets as we do. In addition, specific reliable comparative figures are not available for many of our competitors. In most product groups, competition comes from numerous concerns, both large and small. The principal methods of competition are service, product performance, technical innovation and price. These methods vary with the type of product sold. We believe we compete effectively on the basis of each of these factors.\nNon-GAAP Measures - Organic revenue growth (decline) presented herein is defined as revenue growth (decline) excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions/divestitures, and the impact of the revenue reduction that resulted from the second and fourth quarter 2017 and third quarter 2015 revisions to the expected revenues and profits on our large power projects in South Africa of $13.5, $23.4 and $57.2, respectively. We believe this metric is a useful financial measure for investors in evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented, as, when read in conjunction with our revenues, it presents a useful tool to evaluate our ongoing operations and provides investors with a tool they can use to evaluate our management of assets held from period to period. In addition, organic revenue\ngrowth (decline) is one of the factors we use in internal evaluations of the overall performance of our business. This metric, however, is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d), should not be considered a substitute for net revenue growth (decline) as determined in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nThe following table provides selected financial information for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, including the reconciliation of organic revenue decline to net revenue decline:\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td>

Revenues - For 2017, the decrease in revenues, compared to 2016, was due, in part, to a decline in organic revenue within our Engineered Solutions reportable segment, partially offset by increases in organic revenue within our Detection and Measurement reportable segment and, to a lesser extent, our HVAC reportable segment. In addition, revenues were negatively impacted by (i) an aggregate reduction in revenue of $36.9 resulting from revisions during the second and fourth quarters of 2017 to the expected revenues and costs on our large power projects in South Africa and (ii) the impact of the sale of the dry cooling business at the end of the first quarter of 2016. These declines in revenue were partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar during 2017. See Results of Reportable Segments\u201d for additional details.\nFor 2016, the decrease in revenues, compared to 2015, was due to the impact of the sale of the dry cooling business at the end of the first quarter of 2016, a decline in organic revenue, and, to a lesser extent, a stronger U.S. dollar in 2016. These decreases were offset partially by the impact of a reduction in revenues of $57.2 during the third quarter of 2015 resulting from a revision to the expected revenues and costs on our large power projects in South Africa. The decline in organic revenue was due primarily to lower sales of process cooling products within our Engineered Solutions reportable segment. See Results of Reportable Segments\u201d for additional details.\nGross Profit - For 2017, the decrease in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenues, compared to 2016, was due primarily to an aggregate reduction in gross profit of $52.8 resulting from revisions during the second\nand fourth quarters of 2017 to the expected revenues and costs of our large power projects in South Africa, partially offset by the impact of the organic revenue growth in our Detection and Measurement reportable segment noted above.\nThe increase in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenue in 2016, compared to 2015, was due primarily to a reduction in gross profit of $95.0 during the third quarter of 2015 associated with a revision to the expected revenues and costs of our large power projects in South Africa. In addition, during 2016, gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenues were impacted favorably by cost reductions and improved operating efficiency at the businesses within our HVAC reportable segment and our power transformer business.\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expense - For 2017, the decrease in SG&A expense, compared to 2016, was due primarily to (i) a decline in actuarial losses for our pension and postretirement plans (net losses of $1.6 in 2017, compared to net losses of $12.0 in 2016 - see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further details), (ii) the impact of the sale of the dry cooling business at the end of the first quarter of 2016, and (iii) cost reductions within our Detection and Measurement and Engineered Solutions reportable segments over the past year.\nFor 2016, the decrease in SG&A expense, compared to 2015, was due primarily to declines in corporate expense of $61.7, pension and postretirement expense of $3.2, and long-term incentive compensation expense of $20.2. See Results of Reportable Segments\u201d for additional details on corporate expense, pension and postretirement expense, and long-term incentive compensation expense.\nIntangible Amortization - For 2017, the decline in intangible amortization, compared to 2016, was primarily due to the impact of the $23.9 impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 associated with our Heat Transfer business's definite-lived intangible assets.\nFor 2016, the decline in intangible amortization, compared to 2015, was primarily the result of (i) discontinuing amortization on the long-term assets of our dry cooling business in connection with classifying the business's assets and liabilities as held for sale,\u201d effective December 31, 2015, and (ii) the impact of the $23.9 impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 associated with our Heat Transfer business's definite-lived intangible assets. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details on the impairment charge recorded for the definite-lived intangible assets of our Heat Transfer business.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets - During 2016, we recorded impairment charges of $30.1 related to the intangible assets of our Heat Transfer business, which included $23.9 for definite-lived intangible assets and $6.2 for indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nSee Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of impairment charges.\nSpecial Charges, Net - Special charges, net, related primarily to restructuring initiatives to consolidate manufacturing, distribution, sales and administrative facilities, reduce workforce, and rationalize certain product lines. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for the details of actions taken in 2017, 2016 and 2015. The components of special charges, net, are as follows:\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee termination costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Facility consolidation costs\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other cash costs, net\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash asset write-downs\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGain on Contract Settlement - During the third quarter of 2017, we settled a contract that had been suspended and then ultimately cancelled by a customer for cash proceeds of $9.0 and other consideration. In connection with the settlement, we recorded a gain of $10.2 during the quarter.\nGain on Sale of Dry Cooling Business - On March 30, 2016, we completed the sale of our dry cooling business resulting in a gain of $18.4. See Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\nOther Expense, Net - Other expense, net, for 2017 was composed primarily of charges of $3.5 associated with asbestos product liability matters, foreign currency transaction losses of $2.9, and losses on currency forward embedded derivatives ( FX embedded derivatives\u201d) of $0.6, partially offset by a gain of $2.7 associated with the\ndiscontinuance of hedge accounting on our interest rate swap agreements, income from company-owned life insurance policies of $1.7, and equity earnings in joint ventures of $0.7.\nOther expense, net, for 2016 was composed primarily of charges of $4.2 associated with asbestos product liability matters, losses on foreign currency forward contracts ( FX forward contracts\u201d) of $5.1, and losses on FX embedded derivatives of $1.2. These amounts were offset partially by foreign currency transaction gains of $3.9, income from company-owned life insurance policies of $2.8, equity earnings in joint ventures of $1.5, income associated with transition services provided in connection with the sale of the dry cooling business of $0.9, and gains on asset sales of $0.9.\nOther expense, net, for 2015 was composed primarily of charges of $8.0 associated with asbestos product liability matters, foreign currency transaction losses of $7.4, and losses on FX forward contracts of $7.7, partially offset by gains of $6.5 on FX embedded derivatives, income from company-owned life insurance policies of $3.8, and equity earnings in joint ventures of $1.5.\nInterest Expense, Net - Interest expense, net, includes both interest expense and interest income. The increase in interest expense, net, during 2017, compared to 2016, was primarily a result of a higher weighted-average interest rate and higher average debt balances during 2017, compared to 2016.\nThe decrease in interest expense, net, during 2016, compared to 2015, was primarily the result of a decline in interest expense due to lower average debt balances during 2016.\nLoss on Amendment/Refinancing of Senior Credit Agreement - During the fourth quarter of 2017, we amended our senior credit agreement. In connection with the amendment, we recorded a charge of $0.9 during 2017, which consisted of the write-off of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs related to our senior credit facilities.\nIn the third quarter of 2016, we reduced the issuance capacity under our foreign credit facilities by $200.0. In connection with such reduction, we recorded a charge of $1.3 associated with the write-off of the unamortized deferred financing costs related to the $200.0 of previously available issuance capacity.\nIn the third quarter of 2015, we refinanced our senior credit facilities in connection with the Spin-Off. As a result of the refinancing, we recorded a charge of $1.4 during 2015, which consisted of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to our prior senior credit facilities.\nIncome Taxes - During 2017, we recorded an income tax benefit of $47.9 on $36.1 of pre-tax income from continuing operations, resulting in an effective tax rate of (132.7)%. The most significant items impacting the income tax benefit for 2017 were a tax benefit of $77.6 related to a worthless stock deduction in the U.S. associated with our investment in a South African subsidiary and $4.9 of tax benefits related to various audit settlements, statute expirations, and other adjustments to liabilities for uncertain tax positions, partially offset by $11.8 of net tax charges associated with the impact of the new tax regulations in the U.S. previously discussed and foreign losses generated during the year of $68.2 for which no foreign tax benefit was recognized as future realization of a foreign tax benefit is considered unlikely.\nDuring 2016, we recorded an income tax provision of $9.1 on $39.4 of a pre-tax income from continuing operations, resulting in an effective tax rate of 23.1%. The most significant items impacting the effective tax rate for 2016 were the $0.3 of income taxes provided in connection with the $18.4 gain that was recorded on the sale of the dry cooling business, $13.7 of foreign losses generated during the period for which no tax benefit was recognized as future realization of any such foreign tax benefit is considered unlikely, and $2.4 of tax benefits related to various audit settlements, statute expirations, and other adjustments to liabilities for uncertain tax positions.\nDuring 2015, we recorded an income tax benefit of $2.7 on $154.3 of a pre-tax loss from continuing operations, resulting in an effective tax rate of 1.7%. The most significant item impacting the effective tax rate for 2015 was the effects of approximately $139.0 of foreign losses generated during the year for which no tax benefit was recognized, as future realization of such foreign tax benefit is considered unlikely. In addition, we incurred foreign tax charges of $3.7 related to the Spin-Off and the reorganization actions undertaken to facilitate the Spin-Off and $3.4 of net charges related to various audit settlements, statute expirations, and other adjustments to liabilities for uncertain tax positions.\nResults of Discontinued Operations\nSale of Balcke D\u00fcrr Business\nAs indicated in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, we completed the sale of Balcke D\u00fcrr on December 30, 2016 for cash proceeds of less than $0.1. In addition, we left $21.1 of cash in Balcke D\u00fcrr at the time of the sale and provided the buyer with a non-interest bearing loan of $9.1, payable in installments due at the end of 2018 and 2019. In connection with the sale, we recorded a net loss of $78.6 to Gain (loss) on disposition of discontinued operations, net of tax\u201d within our consolidated statement of operations for 2016.\nThe results of Balcke D\u00fcrr are presented as a discontinued operation.

The increase in organic revenue was due primarily to an increase in sales of cooling products and heating and ventilation products, partially offset by a decline in sales of boiler products.\nFor 2016, the decrease in revenues, compared to 2015, was due to a decline in organic revenue and, to a lesser extent, the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar during 2016. The organic revenue decline primarily was the result of lower sales of heating and ventilation products.\nIncome - For 2017, income and margin decreased, compared to 2016, primarily as a result of a less profitable sales mix associated with the segment's cooling and boiler products as well as lower absorption of fixed costs within the boiler products business due to the lower sales volumes noted above.\nFor 2016, margin increased, compared to 2015, primarily as a result of improved operating efficiency and a more profitable sales mix within the segment's heating and ventilation products businesses.\nBacklog - The segment had backlog of $41.4 and $28.3 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

The increase in organic revenue was the result of an increase in sales for all of the primary product lines within the segment.\nFor 2016, the decrease in revenues, compared to 2015, was due to a stronger U.S. dollar in 2016 and, to a lesser extent, a decline in organic revenue. The decline in organic revenue was due primarily to a decrease in sales of communication technologies products, generally offset by increases in sales of bus fare collection systems and specialty lighting products.\nIncome - For 2017, the increase in income and margin, compared to 2016, was due primarily to the revenue increase noted above and lower SG&A expense resulting from cost reductions within our bus fare collection systems' and communication technologies' businesses.\nFor 2016, the decrease in income, compared to 2015, was primarily due to the revenue decline noted above.\nBacklog - The segment had backlog of $54.0 and $53.6 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Revenues - For 2017, the decrease in revenues, compared to 2016, was due primarily to a decline in organic revenue, partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar versus the South African Rand during 2017. The decline in organic revenue was the result of lower sales related to the segment's large power projects in South Africa, as these projects generally are in the latter stages of completion, as well as lower sales of power transformers and process cooling products. The decrease in power transformer sales was due primarily to the timing of shipments. In addition, our process cooling business has been impacted by a shift in its sales model, whereby it is now focused more on high-margin components and services and less on lower-margin large projects. In addition, the decrease in revenues compared to the same period in 2016, resulted from an aggregate reduction in revenue of $36.9 related to revisions during the second and fourth quarters of 2017 to the expected revenues and costs on the segment's large power projects in South Africa and the impact of the sale of the dry cooling business at the end of the first quarter of 2016.\nFor 2016, the decrease in revenues, compared to 2015, was due primarily to the impact of the sale of the dry cooling business at the end of the first quarter of 2016, a decline in organic revenue, and, to a lesser extent, the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar in 2016, partially offset by the impact of a reduction in revenues of $57.2 during the third quarter of 2015 resulting from a revision to the expected revenues and costs on the segment's large power projects in South Africa. The decline in organic revenues was due primarily to lower sales of process cooling products.\nIncome - For 2017, the decrease in profit and margin, compared to 2016, was due primarily to an aggregate reduction in profit of $52.8 associated with revisions during the second and fourth quarters of 2017 to the expected revenues and costs of the segment's large power projects in South Africa, partially offset by a $10.2 gain recorded during the third quarter of 2017 resulting from the settlement of a contract that had been suspended and then ultimately cancelled by a customer. In addition, income and margin in 2017, compared to 2016, were favorably impacted by cost reductions at the segment's Heat Transfer business resulting from restructuring actions that were implemented in 2016 and the sale of the dry cooling business, which generated losses in 2016 prior to its sale.\nFor 2016, the increase in profit and margin, compared to 2015, was due primarily to the fact that the segment's results for 2015 included a reduction in profit of $95.0 during the third quarter of 2015 resulting from a revision to the expected revenues and costs on the segment's large power projects in South Africa. During 2016, income and margin for the segment's power transformer business increased as a result of improved operating efficiency. However, these increases were offset partially by lower profitability from process cooling products resulting primarily from the decline in revenue noted above.\nBacklog - The segment had backlog of $434.0 and $416.7 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Approximately 83% of the segment's backlog as of December 31, 2017 is expected to be recognized as revenue during 2018.\nCorporate Expense and Other Expense\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs.\n2016%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs.\n2015%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total consolidated revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,425.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,472.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,559.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate expense\n</td> <td>46.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(59.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% of revenues\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension and postretirement expense\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(64.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term incentive compensation expense\n</td> <td>15.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(59.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCorporate Expense - Corporate expense generally relates to the cost of our Charlotte, NC corporate headquarters. Prior to the Spin-Off, corporate expense also included costs of our Asia Pacific center in Shanghai, China, which was part of the Spin-Off, costs that were previously allocated to the Flow Business that do not meet the requirements to be presented within discontinued operations, and the cost of corporate employees who became employees of SPX FLOW at the time of the Spin-Off. The increase in corporate expense in 2017, compared to 2016, was due primarily to higher incentive compensation expense, as well as higher professional fees. The decrease in corporate expense in 2016, compared to 2015, was due primarily to the elimination of costs in connection with the Spin-Off, including the cost of corporate employees who became employees of SPX FLOW.\nPension and Postretirement Expense - Pension and postretirement expense represents our consolidated expense, which we do not allocate for segment reporting purposes. The decrease in pension and postretirement expense in 2017, compared to 2016, was due primarily to a decline in actuarial losses, as net actuarial losses totaled $1.6 in 2017 and $12.0 in 2016. Actuarial losses in 2017 included net charges of $4.2 related to our fourth quarter remeasurement of our plans' assets and liabilities, partially offset by an actuarial gain of $2.6 recorded in the third quarter of 2017 associated with the remeasurement of the unfunded liability related to certain postretirement benefits. The fourth quarter 2017 net charges resulted primarily from lower discount rates applied to our plans' projected benefit obligations, partially offset by better than expected returns on our plans' assets.\nThe decrease in pension and postretirement expense in 2016, compared to 2015, was due to a decline in actuarial losses, as actuarial losses in 2016 totaled $12.0 compared to $15.9 in 2015. Actuarial losses for 2016 and 2015 resulted primarily from our fourth quarter remeasurement of our plan's assets and liabilities, with the resulting charges for the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2015 totaling $10.2 and $9.6, respectively. The fourth quarter 2016 charges resulted primarily from lower discount rates applied to our plans' projected benefit obligations, while the fourth quarter 2015 charges resulted primarily from lower than expected returns on plan assets. Actuarial losses for 2016 also included charges of $1.8 associated with the second quarter 2016 remeasurement of the assets and liabilities of the SPX U.S. Pension Plan (the U.S. Plan\u201d) and Supplemental Individual Account Retirement Plan ( SIARP\u201d) in connection with lump-sum payments that were made by these plans during the quarter. Actuarial losses for 2015 also included charges of $11.4 associated with the third quarter 2015 remeasurement of the assets and liabilities of the U.S. Plan and SIARP in connection with an amendment to these plans to freeze all benefits of active non-union participants. This amendment also resulted in a curtailment gain of $5.1 during the third quarter of 2015.\nSee Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further details on our pension and postretirement plans.\nLong-term Incentive Compensation Expense - The increase in long-term incentive compensation expense during 2017, compared to the respective period in 2016, was due primarily to additional charges of $1.6 in 2017 associated with certain of our long-term cash-awards, as we now expect to exceed the three-year segment income performance target required of these awards. The decrease in long-term incentive compensation expense in 2016, compared to 2015, was due primarily to the fact that the 2015 amount included $21.6 of costs related to corporate employees who became employees of SPX FLOW at the time of the Spin-Off or retired in connection with the Spin-Off.\nSee Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further details on our long-term incentive compensation plans.\nLiquidity and Financial Condition\nListed below are the cash flows from (used in) operating, investing and financing activities, and discontinued operations, as well as the net change in cash and equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Continuing operations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows from (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(76.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows from (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>(11.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows used in financing activities\n</td> <td>(6.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(173.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows used in discontinued operations\n</td> <td>(6.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(77.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in cash and equivalents due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates\n</td> <td>(5.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(57.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(326.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 Compared to 2016\nOperating Activities - The increase in cash flows from operating activities, compared to 2016, was due primarily to improved operating cash flows across our businesses related to improved profitability and reductions in working capital, partially offset by a year-over-year increase in net income tax payments ($22.9 in 2017, compared to $4.8 in 2016) and an increase in cash outflows associated with our large power projects in South Africa ($56.5 in 2017, compared to $33.1 in 2016).\nInvesting Activities - Cash flows used in investing activities for 2017 were comprised of capital expenditures of $11.0 and an increase in restricted cash of $0.3. Cash flows from investing activities for 2016 related to proceeds from asset sales of $48.1 (including proceeds from the sale of the dry cooling business of $47.6), partially offset by capital expenditures of $11.7.\nFinancing Activities - During 2017, net cash flows used in financing activities primarily related to financing fees of $3.6 paid in connection with the December 2017 amendment of our senior credit agreement and net repayments under our various debt instruments of $1.3. During 2016, net cash flows used in financing activities primarily related to net repayments of debt of $18.9.\nDiscontinued Operations - Cash flows used in discontinued operations for 2017 related to disbursements for liabilities retained in connection with dispositions, while cash flows used in discontinued operations during 2016 related primarily to the operations of our Balcke D\u00fcrr business and the cash disposed of in connection with the sale of Balcke D\u00fcrr.\nChange in Cash and Equivalents due to Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates - Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on our cash and equivalents during 2017 and 2016.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nOperating Activities - The increase in cash flows from operating activities during 2016, compared to 2015, was due primarily to the fact that cash flows used in operating activities during 2015 included disbursements for general corporate overhead costs related to a corporate structure that supported the SPX business prior to the Spin-Off. As previously noted, a significant portion of this corporate structure transferred to SPX FLOW at the time of the Spin-Off and, thus, was no longer part of our company during 2016. In addition, operating cash flows associated with our businesses increased during 2016, compared to 2015, primarily as a result of the timing of cash receipts on certain long-term projects.\nInvesting Activities - Cash flows from investing activities for 2016 related to proceeds from asset sales of $48.1 (including proceeds from the sale of the dry cooling business of $47.6), partially offset by capital expenditures of $11.7. Cash flows used in investing activities during 2015 related to capital expenditures of $16.0, partially offset by proceeds from asset sales of $2.0.\nFinancing Activities - During 2016, net cash flows used in financing activities primarily related to net repayments of debt of $18.9. During 2015, net cash flows used in financing activities primarily related to the cash dividend to SPX\nFLOW in connection with the Spin-Off of $208.6 and dividends paid of $45.9, partially offset by net borrowings under our senior credit facilities of $97.0.\nDiscontinued Operations - Cash flows used in discontinued operations during 2016 related primarily to the operations of our Balcke D\u00fcrr business and the cash disposed of in connection with the sale of Balcke D\u00fcrr, while cash flows used in discontinued operations during 2015 related primarily to the cash flows associated with the FLOW Business.\nChange in Cash and Equivalents due to Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates - Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on our cash and equivalents during 2016. The decrease in cash and equivalents due to foreign currency exchange rates for 2015 reflected primarily a reduction in U.S. dollar equivalent balances of our Euro-denominated cash and equivalents as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro during the period.\nBorrowings\nThe following summarizes our debt activity (both current and non-current) for the year ended December 31, 2017:\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Repayments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(54.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term loans (1)(2)\n</td> <td>339.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>350.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(341.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>347.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade receivables financing arrangement (3)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(74.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other indebtedness (4)\n</td> <td>16.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt\n</td> <td>356.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>517.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(518.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>356.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: short-term debt\n</td> <td>14.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: current maturities of long-term debt\n</td> <td>17.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total long-term debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>323.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>349.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____________________________________________________________\n (1) As noted below, we amended our senior credit agreement on December 19, 2017 and proceeds of $350.0 were made available by way of a new term loan facility, with $328.1 utilized to repay, in full, amounts outstanding under the then-existing term loan facility \n (2) The new term loan is repayable in quarterly installments of 1.25% of the initial loan amount of $350.0, beginning in the first quarter of 2019, with the remaining balance payable in full on December 19, 2022. Balances are net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $2.3 and $1.6 at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. \n (3) Under this arrangement, we can borrow, on a continuous basis, up to $50.0, as available. At December 31, 2017, we had $33.3 of available borrowing capacity under this facility. \n (4) Primarily includes capital lease obligations of $2.1 and $1.7, balances under purchase card programs of $2.8 and $3.9, borrowings under a line of credit in South Africa of $0.0 and $10.2, and borrowings under a line of credit in China of $4.1 and $0.0, at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The purchase card program allows for payment beyond the normal payment terms for goods and services acquired under the program. As this arrangement extends the payment of these purchases beyond their normal payment terms through third-party lending institutions, we have classified these amounts as short-term debt. \n (5) Other\u201d primarily includes debt assumed, foreign currency translation on any debt instruments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the new term loan, and the impact of amortization of debt issuance costs associated with the term loan.  Maturities of long-term debt payable during each of the five years subsequent to December 31, 2017 are $0.5, $18.0, $18.0, $17.9 and $297.7, respectively.\nSenior Credit Facilities\nOn December 19, 2017, we amended our senior credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) to, among other things, extend the term of each facility under the Credit Agreement (with the aggregate of each facility comprising the Senior Credit Facilities\u201d) and provide for committed senior secured financing with an aggregate amount of $900.0, consisting of the following (each with the final maturity of December 19, 2022):\n \u2022 A new term loan facility in an aggregate principle amount of $350.0; \n \u2022 A domestic revolving credit facility, available for loans and letters of credit, in an aggregate principal amount up to $200.0; \n \u2022 A global revolving credit facility, available for loans in Euros, GBP and other currencies, in an aggregate principal amount up to the equivalent of $150.0; \n \u2022 A participation foreign credit instrument facility, available for performance letters of credit and guarantees, in an aggregate principal amount up to the equivalent of $145.0 (previously $175.0); and \n \u2022 A bilateral foreign credit instrument facility, available for performance letters of credit and guarantees, in an aggregate principal amount up to the equivalent of $55.0 (previously $125.0). \nThe above amendment of our Credit Agreement also:\n \u2022 Adjusts the maximum aggregate amount of additional commitments we may seek, without consent of existing lenders, to add an incremental term loan facility and/or increase the commitments in respect of the domestic revolving credit facility, the global revolving credit facility, the participation foreign credit instrument facility, and/or the bilateral foreign credit instrument facility, to (i) the greater of (A) $200.0 or (B) our Consolidated EBITDA for the preceding four fiscal quarters, plus (ii) an amount equal to all voluntary prepayments of the term loan facility and the voluntary prepayments accompanied by permanent commitment reductions of revolving credit facilities and foreign credit instrument facilities, plus (iii) an unlimited amount so long as, immediately after giving effect thereto, our Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio for the prior four fiscal quarters does not exceed 2.75 to 1.00 (with the provisions described in clauses (ii) and (iii) being essentially unchanged from the previous agreement); \n \u2022 Permits unlimited investments, capital stock repurchases and dividends, and prepayments of subordinated debt if our Consolidated Leverage Ratio, after giving pro forma effect to such payments, is less than 2.75 to 1.00 (2.50 to 1.00 prior to the amendment); \n \u2022 Increases the Consolidated Leverage Ratio that we are required to maintain as of the last day of any fiscal quarter to not more than 3.50 to 1.00 (or 4.00 to 1.00 for the four fiscal quarters after certain permitted acquisitions) and included certain add-backs in the definition of consolidated EBITDA used in determining such ratio;

The foreign credit instrument facility is used to issue foreign credit instruments, including bank undertakings to support our foreign operations.\nThe interest rates applicable to loans under the Credit Agreement are, at our option, equal to either (i) an alternate base rate (the highest of (a) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5%, (b) the prime rate of Bank of America, N.A., and (c) the one-month LIBOR rate plus 1.0%) or (ii) a reserve-adjusted LIBOR rate for dollars (Eurodollars) plus, in each case, an applicable margin percentage as previously discussed, which varies based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement generally as the ratio of consolidated total debt (excluding the face amount of undrawn letters of credit, bank undertakings and analogous instruments and net of cash and cash equivalents not to exceed $150.0) at the date of determination to consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the four fiscal quarters ended most recently before such date). We may elect interest periods of one, two, three or six months (and, if consented to by all relevant lenders, twelve months) for Eurodollar borrowings.\nThe weighted-average interest rate of outstanding borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities was approximately 3.2% at December 31, 2017.\nThe fees and bilateral foreign credit commitments are as specified above for foreign credit commitments unless otherwise agreed with the bilateral foreign"}
