Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCompany Overview\nTrinity Industries, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries own businesses that are leading providers of rail transportation products and services in North America. Our rail-related businesses market their railcar products and services under the trade name TrinityRail\u00ae. The TrinityRail integrated business platform provides railcar leasing and management services, railcar manufacturing, and railcar maintenance and modification services. We also own businesses engaged in the manufacturing of products used on the nation's roadways and in traffic control, as well as a transportation business that provides support services to Trinity and a variety of other industrial manufacturers.\nOn November 1, 2018, we completed the separation of Trinity Industries, Inc. into two public companies: (1) Trinity Industries, Inc., comprised of Trinity's rail-related businesses, which are leading providers of rail transportation products and services in North America, and (2) Arcosa, Inc. (\"Arcosa\"), a new public company focused on infrastructure-related products and services. The separation was effected through a pro rata dividend to Trinity's shareholders of all outstanding Arcosa shares and was structured to qualify as a tax free distribution for federal income tax purposes. Following the distribution, Arcosa became an independent, publicly-traded company on the New York Stock Exchange. Trinity did not retain an ownership interest in Arcosa following the completion of the spin-off transaction. See Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the spin-off transaction.\nFollowing the Arcosa spin-off, Trinity now reports its financial results in three principal business segments: the Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group, the Rail Products Group, and the All Other Group. Our All Other segment includes the results of our highway products business, which was previously reported within our former Construction Products Group. Additionally, our heads business, which was previously reported in our former Energy Equipment Group, is now included within the Rail Products Group. Further, our axles and couplers businesses were previously included in our Rail Products Group and were transferred to Arcosa in connection with the spin-off.\nArcosa's results of operations have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this Annual Report on this Form 10-K. Additionally, all intersegment sales between Arcosa and us, previously recorded as intersegment sales and eliminated in consolidation prior to the Arcosa spin-off, are now reflected as third-party sales that, along with their related costs, are no longer eliminated in consolidation.\nAll segment results set forth herein have been recast to present results on a comparable basis.\nExecutive Summary\nFinancial and Operational Highlights\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $2,509.1 million representing an increase of 4.7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.

We completed the purchase in January 2019 at a purchase price of $218.4 million. As a result, 6,779 railcars previously under lease are now wholly owned by our Leasing Group. The purchase was funded using cash on hand and borrowings available to us under our revolving credit facility.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Cyclical Trends Impacting Our Business\nThe industries in which we operate are cyclical in nature. Weaknesses in certain sectors of the U.S. and global economy may make it more difficult to sell or lease certain types of railcars. Additionally, adverse changes in commodity prices or lower demand for certain commodities could result in a decline in customer demand for various types of railcars. We continuously assess demand for our products and services and take steps to align our manufacturing capacity appropriately and rationalize and diversify our leased railcar portfolio. Due to their transactional nature, railcar sales from the lease fleet are the primary driver of fluctuations in results in the Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group. Results in our All Other Group are affected by seasonal fluctuations, with the second and third quarters historically being the quarters with the highest revenues.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,509.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,397.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,089.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenues\n</td> <td>1,938.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,775.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,312.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, engineering, and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>296.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>339.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>313.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gains on disposition of property\n</td> <td>41.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating profit\n</td> <td>315.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>368.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>478.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>167.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>173.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>176.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net\n</td> <td>(3.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes\n</td> <td>151.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>195.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>310.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision (benefit) for income taxes\n</td> <td>42.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(414.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>610.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>203.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nThe tables below present revenue by segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent Change 2018 versus 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>External\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Intersegment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>842.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>842.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rail Products Group\n</td> <td>1,356.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>990.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,346.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All Other\n</td> <td>310.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>361.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Totals before Eliminations\n</td> <td>2,509.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,041.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,550.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Eliminations -

Previously reported amounts have been recast to conform to the current presentation.\nDiscussion of Consolidated Results\nRevenue - Our revenues for 2018 were $2,509.1 million, representing an increase of $111.7 million, or 4.7%, over last year. The increase in revenues for 2018 when compared to the previous year resulted primarily from higher railcar sales volumes and an increase in railcar modifications performed by our maintenance services business, partly offset by pricing pressures on certain railcar types. Our revenues for 2017 were $2,397.4 million, representing a decrease of 22.4% when compared with 2016, primarily as a result of reduced volumes and product mix changes.\nCost of Revenues - Our cost of revenues for 2018 were $1,938.8 million, representing an increase of $163.6 million, or 9.2%, over last year. The increase in cost of revenues for 2018, when compared to the previous year, resulted primarily from higher volumes in our railcar manufacturing and maintenance services businesses and increased depreciation expense associated with the growth of our lease fleet. Cost of revenues for 2017 were $1,775.2 million, representing a decrease of $536.8 million, or 23.2%, over 2016, primarily driven by reduced volumes.\nSelling, engineering, and administrative expenses - Selling, engineering, and administrative expenses decreased by 12.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018, when compared to the prior year primarily due to a reduction in litigation-related expenses. Selling, engineering, and administrative expenses increased by 8.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017, when compared to the prior year primarily due to higher performance-related compensation and litigation-related expenses.\nGains on disposition of property - Gains on disposition of property decreased by $44.0 million, or 51.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, when compared to the prior year primarily due to lower sales of leased railcars, as well as a non-cash charge of $12.6 million associated with our election to forego the early purchase options contained in certain lease agreements. Gains on the disposition of property increased by $70.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to higher sales of leased railcars in 2017 when compared to 2016.\nOperating profit - Operating profit for 2018 totaled $315.1 million, representing a decrease of 14.4% from prior year. The decrease in operating profit for 2018 when compared to 2017 resulted primarily from pricing pressures on certain railcar types in our railcar manufacturing business and lower lease rates in our leasing business. The decrease in operating profit was slightly offset by a reduction in selling, engineering and administrative expenses, and higher volumes and operating efficiencies in our Rail Products Group. Operating profits for the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $368.3 million, representing a decrease of 23.1% from the prior year. The decrease in operating profit for 2017 was primarily driven by lower shipment volumes, partly offset by a higher volume of sales of leased railcars and higher leasing and management operating profit as a result of growth in the lease fleet.\nFor further information regarding the operating results of individual segments, see \"Segment Discussion\" below.\nInterest Expense, Net - Interest expense, net for 2018 totaled $167.4 million, compared to $173.6 million for 2017.\nOther, Net - We reported income in other, net of $3.9 million in 2018, representing an increase of $3.2 million over 2017. The increase was primarily due to lower net periodic benefit costs associated with our company-sponsored pension plans.\nIncome Taxes - The effective tax expense (benefit) rates for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 were 28.1%, (212.2)%, and 34.5%, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2018 reflects the lower 21% federal statutory rate that took effect January 1, 2018 in connection with the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"). The 2018, 2017, and 2016 effective tax rates differ from the federal tax rate of 21%, 35%, and 35%, respectively, as the effective tax rates include the impacts of state income tax expense, income attributable to the noncontrolling interests in partially-owned leasing subsidiaries for which no income tax expense is provided, excess tax deficiencies (benefits) related to equity compensation, the completion of income tax audits that resulted in a net tax benefit and certain other differences.\nIncome tax payments, net of refunds, differ from the current provision primarily based on when estimated tax payments were due as compared to when the related income was earned and taxable. Our consolidated income tax position was a net receivable of $38.4 million and $20.2 million from federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Income tax payments (refunds) during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 totaled $4.1 million, $(79.9) million, and $(65.5) million, respectively.\nSee Note 13 of the Consolidated

lease agreements.\n(2) Depreciation, maintenance and compliance, rent, and selling, engineering, and administrative expenses are components of operating profit. Amortization of deferred profit on railcars sold from the Rail Products Group to the Leasing Group is included in the operating profits of the Leasing Group resulting in the recognition of depreciation expense based on our original manufacturing cost of the railcars. Interest expense is not a component of operating profit and includes the effect of hedges.\nTotal revenues for the Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group were substantially unchanged for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to 2017. Revenues attributable to sales of leased railcars owned one year or less were higher in 2018 when compared to 2017, due to a higher volume of railcars sold partially offset by a change in the mix of the types of cars sold from the fleet. Additionally, leasing and management revenues decreased 2.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to 2017, primarily as a result of lower average rental rates, as well as lower lease fleet management advisory fees earned in the current year, partially offset by growth in the lease fleet.\nTotal revenues increased by 2.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to growth in leasing and management revenues, partially offset by a lower volume of sales of leased railcars owned one year or less. Leasing and management revenues increased 6.1% due primarily to growth in the lease fleet, higher lease fleet management advisory fees, and a cancellation fee received in October 2017, partially offset by the effect of lower average rental rates.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 the Leasing Group received total proceeds from the sale of leased railcars as follows:\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing Group:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales of railcars owned one year or less at the time of sale\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>126.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Railcars owned more than one year at the time of sale\n</td> <td>230.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>360.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rail Products Group\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>344.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>460.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>171.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating profit decreased by 21.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to a decline in operating profit attributable to our leasing and management services business. This decrease of 14.5% was primarily the result of higher depreciation and maintenance and compliance expenses associated with the growth of the lease fleet, lower average rental rates, and lower lease fleet management advisory fees earned in comparison to the prior year. Additionally, segment operating profit was impacted by a decrease in sales of railcars owned more than one year at the time of sale, a change in the mix of of the types of railcars sold from the fleet, and a non-cash charge of $12.6 million associated with our election to forego the early purchase options contained in certain lease agreements.\nOperating profit increased by 23.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a higher volume of sales of leased railcars. Leasing and management operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by 9.2% due to growth in the lease fleet, higher lease fleet management advisory fees, and lower fleet maintenance and compliance expense.\nThe Leasing Group generally uses its non-recourse warehouse loan facility or cash to provide initial funding for a portion of the purchase price of the railcars. After initial funding, the Leasing Group may obtain long-term financing for the railcars in the lease fleet through non-recourse asset-backed securities; long-term non-recourse operating leases

December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 reflect the removal of 400, 1,140, and 250 railcars, respectively, that have not been netted against orders.\nRevenues and cost of revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 by 14.8% and 18.2%, respectively, when compared to the prior year. These increases primarily resulted from a higher volume of railcar deliveries and product mix changes, partially offset by pricing pressures related to certain railcar types. The increase in revenues was also driven by growth in our maintenance services business.\nRevenues decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017 by 32.5% when compared to 2016 with approximately 94% of the decrease in Rail Products Group revenue resulting from a decrease in unit deliveries with the remainder primarily due to product mix changes. Cost of revenues decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017 by 28.8% when compared with the prior year primarily due to a decrease in unit deliveries.\nOperating profit decreased for the year ended December 31, 2018 by 12.3% when compared to 2017 primarily as a result of pricing pressures for certain railcar types and product mix changes, partially offset by a higher volume of railcar deliveries and growth in our maintenance services business. Selling, engineering, and administrative costs were substantially unchanged for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to 2017.\nOperating profit decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017 by 56.3% when compared to 2016 primarily as a result of a decrease in railcar unit deliveries. Additionally, operating profit in 2017 was impacted by changes to pricing and product mix.\nTotal backlog dollars increased by 68.5% when comparing December 31, 2018 to the prior year, primarily resulting from an increase in railcar unit orders, and a 23.3% higher average selling price on new orders compared to the previous year, driven primarily by changes to the product mix and fluctuations in steel prices. Backlog decreased when comparing 2017 versus 2016 due to unit decreases and lower prices. The average selling price in the backlog at December 31, 2017 was 6.9% lower as compared to the previous year primarily due to pricing and product mix changes. Approximately 64% of our railcar backlog is expected to be delivered during the year ending December 31, 2019 with the remainder to be delivered thereafter into 2023. The orders in our backlog from the Leasing Group are fully supported by lease commitments with external customers. The final amount of backlog\nattributable to the Leasing Group may vary by the time of delivery as customers may choose to purchase railcars from the Rail Products Group rather than lease.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, railcar shipments included sales to the Leasing Group of $876.0 million with a deferred profit of $77.2 million, representing 9,013 railcars, compared to $732.0 million with a deferred profit of $92.0 million, representing 7,745 railcars, in the comparable period in 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, railcar shipments included sales to the Leasing Group of $1,021.9 million with a deferred profit of $178.2 million, representing 9,385 railcars. Sales to the Leasing Group and related profits are included in the operating results of the Rail Products Group but are eliminated in consolidation. In 2018, the Leasing Group purchased 44.8% of our railcar production, compared to 42.1% in 2017 and 34.5% in 2016.\nAll Other\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 versus 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 versus 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Highway Products\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>267.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>245.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>271.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>361.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>333.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>356.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating costs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenues\n</td> <td>284.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>271.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>295.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, engineering, and administrative costs\n</td> <td>44.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property disposition (gains) losses\n</td> <td>(3.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Not meaningful\nRevenues, cost of revenues, and operating profit increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to higher shipping volumes and changes in the mix of products sold in our highway products portfolio. Cost of revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 by $12.6 million over the prior year primarily due to higher volumes. Included in cost of revenues are insurance recoveries of $11.8 million related to damages previously sustained at two highway products manufacturing facilities, which were partially offset by certain manufacturing inefficiencies in our highway products business. Selling, engineering, and administrative costs decreased 27.4% compared to the previous year primarily as a result of lower litigation related expenses.\nRevenues and cost of revenues decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to lower volumes in our highway products business, partially offset by higher volumes in our other businesses.\nCorporate\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 versus 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 versus 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>149.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>175.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 is primarily due to lower litigation-related expenses and consulting fees, partially offset by higher performance-related incentive compensation costs related to the spin-off.\nThe increase in operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 is primarily due to higher litigation-related expenses and performance-related incentive compensation costs.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nWe expect to finance future operating requirements with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities; cash flows from operations; and short-term debt, long-term debt, and equity. Debt instruments that we have utilized include the TILC warehouse facility, senior notes, convertible subordinated notes, asset-backed securities, non-recourse promissory notes, sale-leaseback transactions, and our revolving credit facility.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balances of $179.2 million, and $392.5 million available under our revolving credit facility. Under the TILC warehouse facility, $375.2 million was unused and available as of December 31, 2018 based on the amount of warehouse-eligible, unpledged equipment. We believe we have access to adequate capital resources to fund operating requirements and are an active participant in the capital markets.\nStrategic Activities in 2018 Impacting Liquidity\nExpansion of TRL -2017 Loan - On November 8, 2018, TRL-2017, entered into an Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement (the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement\u201d) among the lenders party thereto, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, as Administrative Agent, and U.S. Bank National Association, as Collateral Agent, Custodian and Depositary. The Amended and Restated Loan Agreement amends and restates the Term Loan Agreement dated as of May 15, 2017 (the Original Loan Agreement\u201d) among the lenders party thereto, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, as Administrative Agent, and U.S. Bank National Association, as Collateral Agent, Custodian and Depositary.

The Credit Agreement replaced Trinity's prior credit agreement, dated as of May 20, 2015. The Credit Agreement provides for a $450.0 million unsecured revolving line of credit with a maturity date of November 1, 2023. The Credit Agreement includes a $100.0 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. Trinity may also increase the amount of the commitments under the Credit Agreement by an aggregate amount not to exceed $200.0 million, subject to certain conditions including the agreement of existing Lenders to increase their commitments or by obtaining commitments from one or more new Lenders. As of December 31, 2018, we had letters of credit issued under our Credit Agreement in an aggregate principal amount of $57.5 million, leaving $392.5 million available for borrowing. Other than these letters of credit, there were no borrowings under our Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2018, or for the year then ended.\nSecondary Market Railcar Purchase - On October 17, 2018, our Railcar Leasing and Management Services group acquired, from an unrelated seller, a portfolio of railcars for $75.4 million in cash. As a result of the purchase transaction, the Leasing Group acquired approximately 4,150 railcars, substantially all of which are currently under lease to third parties, and assumed indebtedness of approximately $283.9 million with maturities ranging from 2018 through 2035. We have recorded the acquired railcars, the attached leases, and the assumed debt at fair value in our Consolidated Financial Statements as of the purchase date.\nRedemption of Convertible Notes due 2036 - On April 23, 2018, the Company issued a Notice of Redemption to redeem our then-outstanding Convertible Notes on June 1, 2018 at a redemption price in cash equal to 100% of their principal amount plus accrued but unpaid interest (including any contingent interest), if any, to but excluding June 1, 2018 (the \"Redemption Date\"). Immediately prior to the Redemption Date, the aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes outstanding was approximately $449.3 million. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the Convertible Notes, the settlement of the Convertible Notes submitted for conversion occurred on various dates between May 30, 2018 and July 3, 2018. The Company elected to exercise its rights to settle the Convertible Notes in cash rather than in shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. The Company completed settlements for the remaining Convertible Notes, for an aggregate cash amount of approximately $646.6 million. Following the redemption and settlement of the conversions, there were no Convertible Notes outstanding under the indenture, and the indenture was satisfied and discharged in accordance with its terms. In connection with the election to settle the redemption of the Convertible Notes entirely with cash, the Company avoided the issuance of up to 5.7 million shares, valued at approximately $198.1 million and representing the amount in excess of par.\nTRL-2018 Railcar Financing - In June 2018, TRL-2018 issued $482.5 million of TRL-2018 Secured Railcar Equipment Notes. The TRL-2018 Secured Railcar Equipment Notes consisted of two classes of notes with (i) an aggregate principal amount of $200.0 million of Class A-1 Notes, and (ii) an aggregate principal amount of $282.5 million of Class A-2 Notes. The TRL-2018 Secured Railcar Equipment Notes were issued pursuant to a Master Indenture, dated June 20, 2018 between TRL-2018 and Wilmington Trust Company, as indenture trustee. The Class A-1 Notes, of which $190.0 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2018, bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.82%, are payable monthly, and have a stated final maturity date of June 17, 2048. The Class A-2 Notes, of which $282.5 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2018, bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.62%, are payable monthly, and have a stated final maturity date of June 17, 2048. These notes are obligations of TRL-2018 only, secured by a portfolio of railcars and operating leases thereon acquired and owned by TRL-2018, certain cash reserves, and other assets of TRL-2018.\nAmendment of TILC Warehouse Loan Facility - The TILC warehouse loan facility was established to finance railcars owned by TILC. In March 2018, the facility, previously totaling $1.0 billion, was extended through March 2021 at a reduced amount of $750.0 million at the Company's election. The principal and interest of this indebtedness are paid from the cash flows of the underlying leases. Advances under the facility bear interest at a defined index rate plus a margin, for an all-in interest rate of 4.11% at December 31, 2018. Outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2018 were $374.8 million, and $375.2 million was unused and available based on the amount of warehouse-eligible, unpledged equipment. Amounts outstanding at maturity, absent renewal, are payable under the renewed facility in March 2022.\nReturn of Capital Activities\nShare Repurchases - In December 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a new $500 million share repurchase program effective January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019. The new program replaced the previous program which then expired on December 31, 2017. In the first three quarters of 2018, we repurchased 4,327,158 shares at a cost of approximately $150.1 million. On November 16, 2018, we entered into the ASR Program to repurchase $350 million of the Company's common stock. The $350 million notional value of the ASR Program represents the entire remaining amount that was available to us under our existing share repurchase program. Under this program, 12,879,485 shares were repurchased during the three months ended December 31, 2018, at a cost of approximately $280.0 million, representing approximately 80% of the notional value of the ASR Program. These repurchases under the ASR Program bring our full-year share repurchases for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 17,206,643 shares at a cost of $430.1 million, excluding fees. This amount excludes $70.0 million that was funded in 2018 upon the execution of the ASR Program, but was outstanding at December 31, 2018 and is expected to be settled by the end of the first quarter of 2019. The final number of shares to be delivered to Trinity under the ASR Program will be based on Trinity's volume-weighted average stock price, less a discount, during the term of the program. Certain shares of stock repurchases during December 2017, totaling $6.0 million, were cash settled in January 2018 in accordance with normal settlement practices.\nQuarterly Cash Dividend - Trinity has paid 219 consecutive dividends. Quarterly dividends of $0.13 per share were paid in 2018, totaling approximately $75.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Two quarterly dividends of $0.11 per share and two quarterly dividends of $0.13 per share were paid in 2017, totaling approximately $75.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nCash Flows\nThe Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows include amounts related to discontinued operations, which are primarily related to the spin-off of Arcosa, completed on November 1, 2018. These amounts have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for each of the last three years:\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flows from continuing operations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>274.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>610.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>837.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(412.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(346.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(942.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>(291.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(56.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(307.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flows from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>(193.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>172.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(623.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>232.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(240.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 compared with 2017\nOperating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $274.2 million compared to $610.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Cash flow provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased primarily from decreased earnings in the current year period.\nReceivables at December 31, 2018 increased by $88.5 million or 38.7% from December 31, 2017 primarily due to higher trade receivables. Raw materials inventory increased $132.6 million to support railcar production in 2019, while work in process inventory decreased by $15.4 million, at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. Finished goods inventory increased by $4.7 million or 8.1% since December 31, 2017 primarily due to our highway products business. Accounts payable increased by $92.7 million, primarily as a result of the build-up of raw materials inventory to support 2019 railcar production noted above. Accrued liabilities increased by $51.5 million from December 31, 2017 primarily due to higher insurance accruals and payables related to the spin-off of Arcosa. We continually review reserves related to collectibility as well as the adequacy of lower of cost or net realizable value with regard to accounts receivable and inventory.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash required by investing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $412.3 million compared to $346.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $985.6 million, which included $1,040.7 million for investment in the lease fleet less $92.4 million for the cost of sold lease fleet railcars owned one year or less. This compares to $630.3 million of capital expenditures for the same period last year, which included $688.2 million for additions to the lease fleet less $79.9 million for the cost of sold lease fleet railcars owned one year or less. Proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment and other assets totaled $247.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, including railcar sales from the lease fleet owned more than one year at the time of sale totaling $230.5 million. This compares to $368.5 million for the same period in 2017, including railcar sales from the lease fleet owned more than one year at the time of sale totaling $360.7 million. Short-term marketable securities decreased by $319.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. There was no acquisition or divestiture activity for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. The Arcosa spin-off was a non-cash distribution of net assets and therefore did not impact investing activities.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash required by financing activities from continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $291.1 million compared to $56.7 million for the same period in 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we borrowed $1,206.6 million, net of debt issuance costs, primarily from the issuance by TRL-2018 of secured railcar equipment notes, the expansion of TRL-2017 promissory notes, and gross borrowings under the TILC Warehouse Loan facility. Additionally, we had debt repayments of $887.8 million in debt, primarily consisting of the redemption of our Convertible Notes and pay downs during 2018 of borrowings under TILC Warehouse Loan facility. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we borrowed $533.5 million, net of debt issuance costs, primarily from the issuance by TRL-2017 of promissory notes and the issuance by TRIP Master Funding of secured railcar equipment notes. Additionally, we retired $375.3 million in debt, primarily consisting of previously-issued TRIP Master Funding secured railcar equipment notes. We also repurchased shares of our common stock under a share repurchase program as described further above. We intend to use our cash and committed credit facilities to fund our operations, expansions, and growth initiatives. Additionally, we may use our cash and committed credit facilities to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt prior to its stated maturity or repurchase shares of our common stock.\n2017 compared with 2016\nOperating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $610.1 million compared to $837.5 million for the same period in 2016. Cash flow provided by operating activities decreased primarily due to operating profit.\nReceivables at December 31, 2017 decreased by $117.2 million from December 31, 2016 primarily due to a lower income tax receivable. Raw materials inventory at December 31, 2017 decreased by $11.5 million since December 31, 2016, while work in process inventory increased by $2.8 million primarily in our Rail Products Group. Finished goods inventory increased by $0.1 million or 0.2% since December 31, 2016 due to higher inventory balances carried at the previous year end for scheduled shipments in early 2017 in our Rail Products Groups. Accounts payable increased by $12.2 million, while accrued liabilities increased by $49.0 million from December 31, 2016 due to higher compensation accruals.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash required by investing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $346.3 million compared to $942.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $630.3 million, which included $688.2 million for investment in the lease fleet less $79.9 million for the cost of sold lease fleet railcars owned one year or less. This compares to $848.6 million of capital expenditures for the same period in 2016, which included $891.1 million for additions to the lease fleet less $92.0 million for the cost of sold lease fleet railcars owned one year or less. Proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment and other assets totaled $368.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, including railcar sales from the lease fleet owned more than one year at the time of sale totaling $360.7 million. This compares to $48.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, including railcar sales from the lease fleet owned more than one year at the time of sale totaling $37.7 million. Short-term marketable securities for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased $84.8 million. There was no acquisition or divestiture activity for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash required by financing activities from continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $56.7 million compared to $307.7 million for the same period in 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we borrowed $533.5 million, net of debt issuance costs, primarily from the issuance by TRL-2017 of promissory notes and the issuance by TRIP Master Funding of secured railcar equipment notes. Additionally, we retired $375.3 million in debt, primarily consisting of previously-issued TRIP Master Funding secured railcar equipment notes. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we retired $162.0 million in debt as scheduled. Additionally, we repurchased shares of our stock under our prior share repurchase program.\nCurrent Debt Obligations\nPlease refer to Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company's current debt obligations.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures for 2018 were $985.6 million with $948.3 million utilized for net lease fleet additions, net of deferred profit of $77.2 million. Full-year manufacturing/corporate capital expenditures for 2019 are projected to range between $90 million and $110 million. Additionally, we expect to make capital expenditures for new lease fleet additions, secondary market purchases, modifications and other capitalized betterments of the lease fleet. In total, when combined with the proceeds from secondary market sales, and after taking into account deferred profit on new railcar additions, we anticipate a net lease fleet investment of between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion in 2019.\nEquity Investment\nSee Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our investment in partially-owned leasing subsidiaries.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had letters of credit issued under our Credit Agreement in an aggregate principal amount of $57.5 million, the full amount of which is expected to expire in 2019. The majority of our letters of credit obligations support our various insurance programs and generally renew by their terms each year. See Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about our corporate revolving credit facility.\nSee Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about off balance sheet arrangements with regard to our Leasing Group.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe may use derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, both in anticipation of future debt issuances and to offset interest rate variability of certain floating rate debt issuances outstanding. We also may use derivative instruments from time to time to mitigate the impact of changes in natural gas and diesel fuel prices and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are accounted for in accordance with applicable accounting standards. See Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of how we utilize our derivative instruments.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have a stock-based compensation plan covering our employees and our Board of Directors. See Note 16 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nEmployee Retirement Plans\nAs disclosed in Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, the assets of the employee retirement plans exceeded the projected benefit obligations by $25.5 million as of December 31, 2018, and the projected benefit obligations exceeded the plans' assets by $2.0 million as of December 31, 2017. The change was primarily due to employer contributions to the pension plans of $31.6 million during 2018 and an increase in the obligation discount rate assumption, partly offset by a lower return on assets in 2018. We continue to sponsor an employee savings plan under the existing 401(k) plan that covers substantially all domestic employees and includes both a Company matching contribution and an annual retirement contribution of up to 3% each of eligible compensation based on Company financial performance, as well as a Supplemental Profit Sharing Plan. Both the annual retirement contribution and the Company matching contribution are discretionary, requiring board approval, and made annually with the investment of the funds directed by the participants.\nEmployer contributions for the year ending December 31, 2019 are expected to be $1.1 million for the defined benefit plans, compared to $31.6 million contributed during 2018. Contributions to the defined benefit plans in 2018 included a one-time discretionary contribution of $25.0 million. Employer contributions to the 401(k) plans and the Supplemental Profit Sharing Plan for the year ending December 31, 2019 are expected to be $10.8 million, compared to $15.4 million contributed during 2018.\nSee Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our defined benefit plans.\nContractual Obligation and Commercial Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Table 91: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 Year\nor Less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2-3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Parent and wholly-owned subsidiaries(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,739.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>125.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>264.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>584.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,764.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Partially-owned subsidiaries(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,327.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,048.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>778.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>172.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>310.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>185.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,845.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>344.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>687.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>890.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,922.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing Group\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>261.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>231.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Obligations for purchase of goods and services(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>834.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>800.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,951.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,381.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>739.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>905.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,925.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Excludes unamortized discount and debt issuance costs.\n(2) Includes $763.9 million in purchase obligations for raw materials and components primarily by the Rail Products Group.\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $11.8 million and $10.2 million, respectively, of tax liabilities, including interest and penalties, related to uncertain tax positions. Because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to estimate the years in which settlement will occur with the respective taxing authorities, and, accordingly, such amounts are excluded from the table above. See Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAs further discussed in Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Leasing Group leases railcars from certain independent owner Trusts under operating leases with an option to purchase the railcars at a predetermined fixed price in 2019. At December 31, 2018, operating lease obligations to the Trusts totaled $199.0 million. In January 2018, the Leasing Group provided the Trusts with an irrevocable twelve-month notice of intent to exercise their option to purchase all of the Trusts' railcars. We completed the purchase on January 14, 2019 at a purchase price of $218.4 million, which is reflected in the table above. As a result, 6,779 railcars previously under lease are now wholly owned by our Leasing Group.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to bad debts, inventories, property, plant, equipment, goodwill, income taxes, warranty obligations, insurance, restructuring costs, contingencies, and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nInventory\nWe state our inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Our policy related to excess and obsolete inventory requires an analysis of inventory at the business unit level on a quarterly basis and the recording of any required adjustments. In assessing the ultimate realization of inventories, we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current or committed inventory levels. It is possible that changes in required inventory reserves may occur in the future due to then current market conditions.\nLong-lived Assets\nWe periodically evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets for potential impairment. The carrying value of long-lived assets is considered impaired when the carrying value is not recoverable through undiscounted future cash flows and the fair value of the assets is less than their carrying value. Fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved or market quotes as available. Impairment losses on long-lived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced by the estimated cost to dispose of the assets.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually, or on an interim basis if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the goodwill might be impaired. The quantitative goodwill impairment test is a two-step process with step one requiring the comparison of the reporting unit's estimated fair value with the carrying amount of its net assets. If necessary, step two of the impairment test determines the amount of goodwill impairment to be recorded when the reporting unit's recorded net assets exceed its fair value. Impairment is assessed at the reporting unit\u201d level by applying a fair value-based test for each unit with recorded goodwill. The estimates and judgments that most significantly affect the fair value calculations are assumptions related to revenue and operating profit growth, discount rates and exit multiples. We consider these to be level three inputs in the fair value hierarchy, as they involve unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data and thus require management to develop its own assumptions.\nBased on our annual goodwill impairment test, performed at the reporting unit level as of December 31, 2018, we concluded that no impairment charges were determined to be necessary and that none of the reporting units evaluated was at risk of failing the first step of the goodwill impairment test. A reporting unit is considered to be at risk if its estimated fair value does not exceed the carrying value of its net assets by 10% or more. See Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nGiven the uncertainties of the economy and its potential impact on our businesses, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of our reporting units, made for the purposes of the long-lived asset and goodwill impairment tests, will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. If our assumptions regarding forecasted cash flows are not achieved, it is possible that impairments of remaining goodwill and long-lived assets may be required.\nInsurance\nWe are effectively self-insured for workers' compensation and employee health care claims. Third-party administrators process all such claims. We accrue our workers' compensation and group medical liabilities based upon independent actuarial studies. These liabilities are calculated based upon loss development factors, which contemplate a number of variables, including claims history and expected trends. These loss development factors are developed in consultation with third-party actuaries. To the extent actuarial assumptions change and claims experience rates differ from historical rates, our liability may change.\nContingencies and Litigation\nThe Company is involved in claims and lawsuits incidental to our business. Based on information currently available with respect to such claims and lawsuits, including information on claims and lawsuits as to which the Company is aware but for which the Company has not been served with legal process, it is management's opinion that the ultimate outcome of all such claims\nand litigation, including settlements, in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition for purposes of financial reporting. However, resolution of certain claims or lawsuits by settlement or otherwise, could impact the operating results of the reporting period in which such resolution occurs. See Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further explanation.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by ASC 740. See Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and other tax attributes using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the provision for income taxes in the period that includes the enactment date. Management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted law and tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, or changes in our structure or tax status. We assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses; a forecast of future profitability; the duration of statutory carryback and carryforward periods; our experience with tax attributes expiring unused; and tax planning alternatives.\nPensions\nWe sponsor defined benefit plans which provide retirement income and death benefits for certain eligible employees. Trinity retained all pension plans following the completion of the Arcosa spin-off on November 1, 2018. Our pension costs and liabilities are primarily determined using actuarial assumptions regarding the long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to determine the present value of future benefit obligations. The accrued benefits of our remaining pension plans were frozen in 2009. See Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nPension assumptions are reviewed annually by outside actuaries and our management. These actuarial assumptions are summarized in the following table:\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at the annual measurement date were:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Obligation discount rate\n</td> <td>4.45\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.79\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation increase rate(1)\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit costs were:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Obligation discount rate\n</td> <td>3.79\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.79\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>5.65\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation increase rate(1)\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The compensation increase rate pertains to a plan associated with our Former Inland Barge Group. The Inland Barge Group was transferred to Arcosa in connection with the spin-off, but Trinity retained all pension plans upon completion of the spin-off. Effective as of November 1, 2018, all participants in this plan have been granted the maximum benefit allowed under the plan; therefore, the compensation increase rate is not applicable.\nThe obligation discount rate assumption is determined by deriving a single discount rate from a theoretical settlement portfolio of high quality corporate bonds sufficient to provide for the plans' projected benefit payments. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is an assumption reflecting the anticipated weighted average rate of earnings on the portfolio over the long-term. To arrive at this rate, estimates were developed based upon the anticipated performance of the plans' assets. The effect of a change in either of these assumptions on the net retirement cost for the year ended December 31, 2018 and on the projected benefit obligations at December 31, 2018 is summarized as follows:\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Effect on Net Retirement Cost for the Year Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effect on Projected Benefit Obligations at December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assumptions:\n</td> <td>Increase/(decrease)\n(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Obligation discount rate:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase of 50 basis points\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(25.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease of 50 basis points\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term rate of return on plan assets:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase of 50 basis points\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease of 50 basis points\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about recent accounting pronouncements.", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I am unable to complete your request because I am unable to identify the specific cells in the table you would like to copy.\n- Would you be able to clarify which cells you would like to copy?\n\nUnfortunately, without this information I am unable to fulfill your request.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCompany Overview\nTrinity Industries, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries own businesses that are leading providers of rail transportation products and services in North America. Our rail-related businesses market their railcar products and services under the trade name TrinityRail\u00ae. The TrinityRail integrated business platform provides railcar leasing and management services, railcar manufacturing, and railcar maintenance and modification services. We also own businesses engaged in the manufacturing of products used on the nation's roadways and in traffic control, as well as a transportation business that provides support services to Trinity and a variety of other industrial manufacturers.\nOn November 1, 2018, we completed the separation of Trinity Industries, Inc. into two public companies: (1) Trinity Industries, Inc., comprised of Trinity's rail-related businesses, which are leading providers of rail transportation products and services in North America, and (2) Arcosa, Inc. (\"Arcosa\"), a new public company focused on infrastructure-related products and services. The separation was effected through a pro rata dividend to Trinity's shareholders of all outstanding Arcosa shares and was structured to qualify as a tax free distribution for federal income tax purposes. Following the distribution, Arcosa became an independent, publicly-traded company on the New York Stock Exchange. Trinity did not retain an ownership interest in Arcosa following the completion of the spin-off transaction. See Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the spin-off transaction.\nFollowing the Arcosa spin-off, Trinity now reports its financial results in three principal business segments: the Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group, the Rail Products Group, and the All Other Group. Our All Other segment includes the results of our highway products business, which was previously reported within our former Construction Products Group. Additionally, our heads business, which was previously reported in our former Energy Equipment Group, is now included within the Rail Products Group. Further, our axles and couplers businesses were previously included in our Rail Products Group and were transferred to Arcosa in connection with the spin-off.\nArcosa's results of operations have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this Annual Report on this Form 10-K. Additionally, all intersegment sales between Arcosa and us, previously recorded as intersegment sales and eliminated in consolidation prior to the Arcosa spin-off, are now reflected as third-party sales that, along with their related costs, are no longer eliminated in consolidation.\nAll segment results set forth herein have been recast to present results on a comparable basis.\nExecutive Summary\nFinancial and Operational Highlights\n \u2022 Our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $2,509.1 million representing an increase of 4.7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Although we experienced improvements in railcar orders and deliveries in 2018, marketplace conditions put downward pressure on pricing for certain railcar types. \n \u2022 Total railcar backlog at December 31, 2018 was $3,647.6 million, compared to $2,164.2 million at December 31, 2017. The Rail Products Group received railcar orders of 28,795 and delivered 20,105 railcars in 2018, in comparison to railcar orders of 12,900 and railcar deliveries of 18,395 in 2017. \n \u2022 The Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group (the \"Leasing Group\") reported additions to the wholly-owned and partially-owned lease fleet of 10,625 railcars in 2018, for a total of 99,215 railcars as of December 31, 2018, an increase of 12%. \n \u2022 The Leasing Group's lease fleet of 99,215 company-owned rail cars was 98.5% utilized as of December 31, 2018, in comparison to a lease fleet utilization of 96.8% on 88,590 company-owned railcars as of December 31, 2017. Our company-owned railcars includes wholly-owned, partially-owned, and railcars under sale-leaseback arrangements. \n \u2022 For 2018, after taking into account deferred profit on new railcar additions, modifications to the lease fleet, and the proceeds from the sales of leased railcars, we made a net investment in our lease fleet of approximately $948.3 million.  See \"Consolidated Results of Operations\" and \"Segment Discussion\" below for additional information regarding our operating results.\nDebt and Capital Allocation Updates\n \u2022 In November 2018, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program (the \"ASR Program\") to repurchase $350 million of the Company's common stock. The $350 million notional value of the ASR Program represents the entire remaining amount that was available to us under our existing share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 12.9 million shares have been delivered to us, representing approximately 80% of the total notional value of the ASR Program. The ASR Program is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2019, at which time the remaining shares will be delivered to the Company. \n \u2022 In November 2018, Trinity Rail Leasing 2017 LLC (\"TRL-2017\"), a Delaware limited liability company and a limited purpose, indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company owned through TILC, entered into an Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement to increase the aggregate amount of the term loan from $302.4 million under the Original Loan Agreement to $663.0 million and to extend the maturity date by approximately eighteen months to November 8, 2025. The proceeds from the expansion of TRL-2017 were used to fund the ASR Program described above. \n \u2022 In November 2018, we amended and restated our prior credit agreement, dated as of May 20, 2015 (as amended from time to time). The amended and restated Credit Agreement provides for a $450.0 million unsecured revolving line of credit with an extended maturity date of November 1, 2023. \n \u2022 In June 2018, Trinity Rail Leasing 2018 LLC (\"TRL-2018\"), a Delaware limited liability company and a limited purpose, indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company owned through TILC, issued $482.5 million of TRL-2018 Secured Railcar Equipment Notes. These notes have an ultimate maturity date of 2048. The net proceeds received from the transaction were used to repay a portion of the conversion settlement value of our convertible subordinated notes that were called for redemption at par on June 1, 2018 as described further below. \n \u2022 In April 2018, the Company issued a Notice of Redemption with respect to our then outstanding 3 7/8% convertible senior notes (the \"Convertible Notes\") to redeem these notes on June 1, 2018. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing these notes, the settlement of these notes submitted for conversion occurred on various dates between May 30, 2018 and July 3, 2018 and were settled in cash, at our election, for an aggregate cash amount of approximately $646.6 million. Following the redemption and settlement of the conversions, there were no Convertible Notes outstanding under the indenture, and the indenture was satisfied and discharged in accordance with its terms.  See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below for further information regarding these activities.\nLitigation Updates\nSee Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for an update on the status of the Company's Highway Products litigation.\nSubsequent Events\n \u2022 As previously disclosed, our Leasing Group leased railcars from certain independent owner Trusts under operating leases, which contained an option to purchase the railcars at a predetermined fixed price in 2019. In January 2018, the Leasing Group provided the Trusts with an irrevocable twelve-month notice of intent to exercise their option to purchase all of the Trusts' railcars. We completed the purchase in January 2019 at a purchase price of $218.4 million. As a result, 6,779 railcars previously under lease are now wholly owned by our Leasing Group. The purchase was funded using cash on hand and borrowings available to us under our revolving credit facility.  Cyclical Trends Impacting Our Business\nThe industries in which we operate are cyclical in nature. Weaknesses in certain sectors of the U.S. and global economy may make it more difficult to sell or lease certain types of railcars. Additionally, adverse changes in commodity prices or lower demand for certain commodities could result in a decline in customer demand for various types of railcars. We continuously assess demand for our products and services and take steps to align our manufacturing capacity appropriately and rationalize and diversify our leased railcar portfolio. Due to their transactional nature, railcar sales from the lease fleet are the primary driver of fluctuations in results in the Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group. Results in our All Other Group are affected by seasonal fluctuations, with the second and third quarters historically being the quarters with the highest revenues.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\n\nRevenue\nThe tables below present revenue by segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\n\nOperating Costs\nOperating costs are comprised of cost of revenues; selling, engineering, and administrative costs; and gains or losses on property disposals. Operating costs by segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\n\nOperating Profit\nOperating profit by segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was as follows:\n\n(1) Historically, the Eliminations - Lease subsidiary line has included only railcar shipments from the Rail Products Group to the Leasing Group; however, beginning January 1, 2018, we elected to include the sales from our maintenance services business, previously reflected in Eliminations - Other, in the Eliminations - Lease subsidiary line. Previously reported amounts have been recast to conform to the current presentation.\nDiscussion of Consolidated Results\nRevenue - Our revenues for 2018 were $2,509.1 million, representing an increase of $111.7 million, or 4.7%, over last year. The increase in revenues for 2018 when compared to the previous year resulted primarily from higher railcar sales volumes and an increase in railcar modifications performed by our maintenance services business, partly offset by pricing pressures on certain railcar types. Our revenues for 2017 were $2,397.4 million, representing a decrease of 22.4% when compared with 2016, primarily as a result of reduced volumes and product mix changes.\nCost of Revenues - Our cost of revenues for 2018 were $1,938.8 million, representing an increase of $163.6 million, or 9.2%, over last year. The increase in cost of revenues for 2018, when compared to the previous year, resulted primarily from higher volumes in our railcar manufacturing and maintenance services businesses and increased depreciation expense associated with the growth of our lease fleet. Cost of revenues for 2017 were $1,775.2 million, representing a decrease of $536.8 million, or 23.2%, over 2016, primarily driven by reduced volumes.\nSelling, engineering, and administrative expenses - Selling, engineering, and administrative expenses decreased by 12.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018, when compared to the prior year primarily due to a reduction in litigation-related expenses. Selling, engineering, and administrative expenses increased by 8.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017, when compared to the prior year primarily due to higher performance-related compensation and litigation-related expenses.\nGains on disposition of property - Gains on disposition of property decreased by $44.0 million, or 51.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, when compared to the prior year primarily due to lower sales of leased railcars, as well as a non-cash charge of $12.6 million associated with our election to forego the early purchase options contained in certain lease agreements. Gains on the disposition of property increased by $70.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to higher sales of leased railcars in 2017 when compared to 2016.\nOperating profit - Operating profit for 2018 totaled $315.1 million, representing a decrease of 14.4% from prior year. The decrease in operating profit for 2018 when compared to 2017 resulted primarily from pricing pressures on certain railcar types in our railcar manufacturing business and lower lease rates in our leasing business. The decrease in operating profit was slightly offset by a reduction in selling, engineering and administrative expenses, and higher volumes and operating efficiencies in our Rail Products Group. Operating profits for the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $368.3 million, representing a decrease of 23.1% from the prior year. The decrease in operating profit for 2017 was primarily driven by lower shipment volumes, partly offset by a higher volume of sales of leased railcars and higher leasing and management operating profit as a result of growth in the lease fleet.\nFor further information regarding the operating results of individual segments, see \"Segment Discussion\" below.\nInterest Expense, Net - Interest expense, net for 2018 totaled $167.4 million, compared to $173.6 million for 2017.\nOther, Net - We reported income in other, net of $3.9 million in 2018, representing an increase of $3.2 million over 2017. The increase was primarily due to lower net periodic benefit costs associated with our company-sponsored pension plans.\nIncome Taxes - The effective tax expense (benefit) rates for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 were 28.1%, (212.2)%, and 34.5%, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2018 reflects the lower 21% federal statutory rate that took effect January 1, 2018 in connection with the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"). The 2018, 2017, and 2016 effective tax rates differ from the federal tax rate of 21%, 35%, and 35%, respectively, as the effective tax rates include the impacts of state income tax expense, income attributable to the noncontrolling interests in partially-owned leasing subsidiaries for which no income tax expense is provided, excess tax deficiencies (benefits) related to equity compensation, the completion of income tax audits that resulted in a net tax benefit and certain other differences.\nIncome tax payments, net of refunds, differ from the current provision primarily based on when estimated tax payments were due as compared to when the related income was earned and taxable. Our consolidated income tax position was a net receivable of $38.4 million and $20.2 million from federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Income tax payments (refunds) during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 totaled $4.1 million, $(79.9) million, and $(65.5) million, respectively.\nSee Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of income taxes.\nSegment Discussion\nRailcar Leasing and Management Services Group\n\n* Not meaningful\n(1) Property disposition losses include a non-cash charge of $12.6 million associated with our election to forego the early purchase options contained in certain lease agreements.\n(2) Depreciation, maintenance and compliance, rent, and selling, engineering, and administrative expenses are components of operating profit. Amortization of deferred profit on railcars sold from the Rail Products Group to the Leasing Group is included in the operating profits of the Leasing Group resulting in the recognition of depreciation expense based on our original manufacturing cost of the railcars. Interest expense is not a component of operating profit and includes the effect of hedges.\nTotal revenues for the Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group were substantially unchanged for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to 2017. Revenues attributable to sales of leased railcars owned one year or less were higher in 2018 when compared to 2017, due to a higher volume of railcars sold partially offset by a change in the mix of the types of cars sold from the fleet. Additionally, leasing and management revenues decreased 2.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to 2017, primarily as a result of lower average rental rates, as well as lower lease fleet management advisory fees earned in the current year, partially offset by growth in the lease fleet.\nTotal revenues increased by 2.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to growth in leasing and management revenues, partially offset by a lower volume of sales of leased railcars owned one year or less. Leasing and management revenues increased 6.1% due primarily to growth in the lease fleet, higher lease fleet management advisory fees, and a cancellation fee received in October 2017, partially offset by the effect of lower average rental rates.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 the Leasing Group received total proceeds from the sale of leased railcars as follows:\n\nOperating profit decreased by 21.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to a decline in operating profit attributable to our leasing and management services business. This decrease of 14.5% was primarily the result of higher depreciation and maintenance and compliance expenses associated with the growth of the lease fleet, lower average rental rates, and lower lease fleet management advisory fees earned in comparison to the prior year. Additionally, segment operating profit was impacted by a decrease in sales of railcars owned more than one year at the time of sale, a change in the mix of of the types of railcars sold from the fleet, and a non-cash charge of $12.6 million associated with our election to forego the early purchase options contained in certain lease agreements.\nOperating profit increased by 23.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a higher volume of sales of leased railcars. Leasing and management operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by 9.2% due to growth in the lease fleet, higher lease fleet management advisory fees, and lower fleet maintenance and compliance expense.\nThe Leasing Group generally uses its non-recourse warehouse loan facility or cash to provide initial funding for a portion of the purchase price of the railcars. After initial funding, the Leasing Group may obtain long-term financing for the railcars in the lease fleet through non-recourse asset-backed securities; long-term non-recourse operating leases pursuant to sales/leaseback transactions; long-term recourse debt such as equipment trust certificates; long-term non-recourse promissory notes; or third-party equity.\nInformation regarding the Leasing Group's lease fleet, managed or owned through its wholly-owned and partially-owned subsidiaries, follows:\n\n(1)Company-owned railcars includes wholly-owned, partially-owned, and railcars under sale-leaseback arrangements.\nRail Products Group\n\nAs of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 our Rail Products Group backlog of railcars was as follows:\n\nThe changes in the number of railcars in the Rail Products Group backlog are as follows:\n\n(1)The ending backlog figures for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 reflect the removal of 400, 1,140, and 250 railcars, respectively, that have not been netted against orders.\nRevenues and cost of revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 by 14.8% and 18.2%, respectively, when compared to the prior year. These increases primarily resulted from a higher volume of railcar deliveries and product mix changes, partially offset by pricing pressures related to certain railcar types. The increase in revenues was also driven by growth in our maintenance services business.\nRevenues decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017 by 32.5% when compared to 2016 with approximately 94% of the decrease in Rail Products Group revenue resulting from a decrease in unit deliveries with the remainder primarily due to product mix changes. Cost of revenues decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017 by 28.8% when compared with the prior year primarily due to a decrease in unit deliveries.\nOperating profit decreased for the year ended December 31, 2018 by 12.3% when compared to 2017 primarily as a result of pricing pressures for certain railcar types and product mix changes, partially offset by a higher volume of railcar deliveries and growth in our maintenance services business. Selling, engineering, and administrative costs were substantially unchanged for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to 2017.\nOperating profit decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017 by 56.3% when compared to 2016 primarily as a result of a decrease in railcar unit deliveries. Additionally, operating profit in 2017 was impacted by changes to pricing and product mix.\nTotal backlog dollars increased by 68.5% when comparing December 31, 2018 to the prior year, primarily resulting from an increase in railcar unit orders, and a 23.3% higher average selling price on new orders compared to the previous year, driven primarily by changes to the product mix and fluctuations in steel prices. Backlog decreased when comparing 2017 versus 2016 due to unit decreases and lower prices. The average selling price in the backlog at December 31, 2017 was 6.9% lower as compared to the previous year primarily due to pricing and product mix changes. Approximately 64% of our railcar backlog is expected to be delivered during the year ending December 31, 2019 with the remainder to be delivered thereafter into 2023. The orders in our backlog from the Leasing Group are fully supported by lease commitments with external customers. The final amount of backlog\nattributable to the Leasing Group may vary by the time of delivery as customers may choose to purchase railcars from the Rail Products Group rather than lease.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, railcar shipments included sales to the Leasing Group of $876.0 million with a deferred profit of $77.2 million, representing 9,013 railcars, compared to $732.0 million with a deferred profit of $92.0 million, representing 7,745 railcars, in the comparable period in 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, railcar shipments included sales to the Leasing Group of $1,021.9 million with a deferred profit of $178.2 million, representing 9,385 railcars. Sales to the Leasing Group and related profits are included in the operating results of the Rail Products Group but are eliminated in consolidation. In 2018, the Leasing Group purchased 44.8% of our railcar production, compared to 42.1% in 2017 and 34.5% in 2016.\nAll Other\n\n* Not meaningful\nRevenues, cost of revenues, and operating profit increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to higher shipping volumes and changes in the mix of products sold in our highway products portfolio. Cost of revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 by $12.6 million over the prior year primarily due to higher volumes. Included in cost of revenues are insurance recoveries of $11.8 million related to damages previously sustained at two highway products manufacturing facilities, which were partially offset by certain manufacturing inefficiencies in our highway products business. Selling, engineering, and administrative costs decreased 27.4% compared to the previous year primarily as a result of lower litigation related expenses.\nRevenues and cost of revenues decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to lower volumes in our highway products business, partially offset by higher volumes in our other businesses.\nCorporate\n\nThe decrease in operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 is primarily due to lower litigation-related expenses and consulting fees, partially offset by higher performance-related incentive compensation costs related to the spin-off.\nThe increase in operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 is primarily due to higher litigation-related expenses and performance-related incentive compensation costs.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nWe expect to finance future operating requirements with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities; cash flows from operations; and short-term debt, long-term debt, and equity. Debt instruments that we have utilized include the TILC warehouse facility, senior notes, convertible subordinated notes, asset-backed securities, non-recourse promissory notes, sale-leaseback transactions, and our revolving credit facility.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balances of $179.2 million, and $392.5 million available under our revolving credit facility. Under the TILC warehouse facility, $375.2 million was unused and available as of December 31, 2018 based on the amount of warehouse-eligible, unpledged equipment. We believe we have access to adequate capital resources to fund operating requirements and are an active participant in the capital markets.\nStrategic Activities in 2018 Impacting Liquidity\nExpansion of TRL -2017 Loan - On November 8, 2018, TRL-2017, entered into an Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement (the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement\u201d) among the lenders party thereto, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, as Administrative Agent, and U.S. Bank National Association, as Collateral Agent, Custodian and Depositary. The Amended and Restated Loan Agreement amends and restates the Term Loan Agreement dated as of May 15, 2017 (the Original Loan Agreement\u201d) among the lenders party thereto, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, as Administrative Agent, and U.S. Bank National Association, as Collateral Agent, Custodian and Depositary. The Amended and Restated Loan Agreement:\n \u2022 increased the aggregate amount of the term loan from $302.4 million under the Original Loan Agreement to $663.0 million; \n \u2022 extended the maturity date by approximately eighteen months to November 8, 2025; \n \u2022 reduced the applicable interest rate to LIBOR plus 150 basis points from LIBOR plus 175 basis points under the Original Loan Agreement; and \n \u2022 added additional railcars to the collateral pool of railcars securing the borrower's obligations under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement.  Amendment of Revolving Credit Facility - On November 1, 2018, in connection with the Arcosa spin-off, Trinity entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d), by and among Trinity, as borrower, the lenders party thereto (the Lenders\u201d), JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association ( JP Morgan\u201d), as administrative agent, Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent, and SunTrust Bank and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as co-documentation agents. The Credit Agreement replaced Trinity's prior credit agreement, dated as of May 20, 2015. The Credit Agreement provides for a $450.0 million unsecured revolving line of credit with a maturity date of November 1, 2023. The Credit Agreement includes a $100.0 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. Trinity may also increase the amount of the commitments under the Credit Agreement by an aggregate amount not to exceed $200.0 million, subject to certain conditions including the agreement of existing Lenders to increase their commitments or by obtaining commitments from one or more new Lenders. As of December 31, 2018, we had letters of credit issued under our Credit Agreement in an aggregate principal amount of $57.5 million, leaving $392.5 million available for borrowing. Other than these letters of credit, there were no borrowings under our Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2018, or for the year then ended.\nSecondary Market Railcar Purchase - On October 17, 2018, our Railcar Leasing and Management Services group acquired, from an unrelated seller, a portfolio of railcars for $75.4 million in cash. As a result of the purchase transaction, the Leasing Group acquired approximately 4,150 railcars, substantially all of which are currently under lease to third parties, and assumed indebtedness of approximately $283.9 million with maturities ranging from 2018 through 2035. We have recorded the acquired railcars, the attached leases, and the assumed debt at fair value in our Consolidated Financial Statements as of the purchase date.\nRedemption of Convertible Notes due 2036 - On April 23, 2018, the Company issued a Notice of Redemption to redeem our then-outstanding Convertible Notes on June 1, 2018 at a redemption price in cash equal to 100% of their principal amount plus accrued but unpaid interest (including any contingent interest), if any, to but excluding June 1, 2018 (the \"Redemption Date\"). Immediately prior to the Redemption Date, the aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes outstanding was approximately $449.3 million. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the Convertible Notes, the settlement of the Convertible Notes submitted for conversion occurred on various dates between May 30, 2018 and July 3, 2018. The Company elected to exercise its rights to settle the Convertible Notes in cash rather than in shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. The Company completed settlements for the remaining Convertible Notes, for an aggregate cash amount of approximately $646.6 million. Following the redemption and settlement of the conversions, there were no Convertible Notes outstanding under the indenture, and the indenture was satisfied and discharged in accordance with its terms. In connection with the election to settle the redemption of the Convertible Notes entirely with cash, the Company avoided the issuance of up to 5.7 million shares, valued at approximately $198.1 million and representing the amount in excess of par.\nTRL-2018 Railcar Financing - In June 2018, TRL-2018 issued $482.5 million of TRL-2018 Secured Railcar Equipment Notes. The TRL-2018 Secured Railcar Equipment Notes consisted of two classes of notes with (i) an aggregate principal amount of $200.0 million of Class A-1 Notes, and (ii) an aggregate principal amount of $282.5 million of Class A-2 Notes. The TRL-2018 Secured Railcar Equipment Notes were issued pursuant to a Master Indenture, dated June 20, 2018 between TRL-2018 and Wilmington Trust Company, as indenture trustee. The Class A-1 Notes, of which $190.0 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2018, bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.82%, are payable monthly, and have a stated final maturity date of June 17, 2048. The Class A-2 Notes, of which $282.5 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2018, bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.62%, are payable monthly, and have a stated final maturity date of June 17, 2048. These notes are obligations of TRL-2018 only, secured by a portfolio of railcars and operating leases thereon acquired and owned by TRL-2018, certain cash reserves, and other assets of TRL-2018.\nAmendment of TILC Warehouse Loan Facility - The TILC warehouse loan facility was established to finance railcars owned by TILC. In March 2018, the facility, previously totaling $1.0 billion, was extended through March 2021 at a reduced amount of $750.0 million at the Company's election. The principal and interest of this indebtedness are paid from the cash flows of the underlying leases. Advances under the facility bear interest at a defined index rate plus a margin, for an all-in interest rate of 4.11% at December 31, 2018. Outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2018 were $374.8 million, and $375.2 million was unused and available based on the amount of warehouse-eligible, unpledged equipment. Amounts outstanding at maturity, absent renewal, are payable under the renewed facility in March 2022.\nReturn of Capital Activities\nShare Repurchases - In December 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a new $500 million share repurchase program effective January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019. The new program replaced the previous program which then expired on December 31, 2017. In the first three quarters of 2018, we repurchased 4,327,158 shares at a cost of approximately $150.1 million. On November 16, 2018, we entered into the ASR Program to repurchase $350 million of the Company's common stock. The $350 million notional value of the ASR Program represents the entire remaining amount that was available to us under our existing share repurchase program. Under this program, 12,879,485 shares were repurchased during the three months ended December 31, 2018, at a cost of approximately $280.0 million, representing approximately 80% of the notional value of the ASR Program. These repurchases under the ASR Program bring our full-year share repurchases for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 17,206,643 shares at a cost of $430.1 million, excluding fees. This amount excludes $70.0 million that was funded in 2018 upon the execution of the ASR Program, but was outstanding at December 31, 2018 and is expected to be settled by the end of the first quarter of 2019. The final number of shares to be delivered to Trinity under the ASR Program will be based on Trinity's volume-weighted average stock price, less a discount, during the term of the program. Certain shares of stock repurchases during December 2017, totaling $6.0 million, were cash settled in January 2018 in accordance with normal settlement practices.\nQuarterly Cash Dividend - Trinity has paid 219 consecutive dividends. Quarterly dividends of $0.13 per share were paid in 2018, totaling approximately $75.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Two quarterly dividends of $0.11 per share and two quarterly dividends of $0.13 per share were paid in 2017, totaling approximately $75.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nCash Flows\nThe Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows include amounts related to discontinued operations, which are primarily related to the spin-off of Arcosa, completed on November 1, 2018. These amounts have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for each of the last three years:\n\n2018 compared with 2017\nOperating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $274.2 million compared to $610.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Cash flow provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased primarily from decreased earnings in the current year period.\nReceivables at December 31, 2018 increased by $88.5 million or 38.7% from December 31, 2017 primarily due to higher trade receivables. Raw materials inventory increased $132.6 million to support railcar production in 2019, while work in process inventory decreased by $15.4 million, at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. Finished goods inventory increased by $4.7 million or 8.1% since December 31, 2017 primarily due to our highway products business. Accounts payable increased by $92.7 million, primarily as a result of the build-up of raw materials inventory to support 2019 railcar production noted above. Accrued liabilities increased by $51.5 million from December 31, 2017 primarily due to higher insurance accruals and payables related to the spin-off of Arcosa. We continually review reserves related to collectibility as well as the adequacy of lower of cost or net realizable value with regard to accounts receivable and inventory.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash required by investing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $412.3 million compared to $346.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $985.6 million, which included $1,040.7 million for investment in the lease fleet less $92.4 million for the cost of sold lease fleet railcars owned one year or less. This compares to $630.3 million of capital expenditures for the same period last year, which included $688.2 million for additions to the lease fleet less $79.9 million for the cost of sold lease fleet railcars owned one year or less. Proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment and other assets totaled $247.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, including railcar sales from the lease fleet owned more than one year at the time of sale totaling $230.5 million. This compares to $368.5 million for the same period in 2017, including railcar sales from the lease fleet owned more than one year at the time of sale totaling $360.7 million. Short-term marketable securities decreased by $319.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. There was no acquisition or divestiture activity for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. The Arcosa spin-off was a non-cash distribution of net assets and therefore did not impact investing activities.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash required by financing activities from continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $291.1 million compared to $56.7 million for the same period in 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we borrowed $1,206.6 million, net of debt issuance costs, primarily from the issuance by TRL-2018 of secured railcar equipment notes, the expansion of TRL-2017 promissory notes, and gross borrowings under the TILC Warehouse Loan facility. Additionally, we had debt repayments of $887.8 million in debt, primarily consisting of the redemption of our Convertible Notes and pay downs during 2018 of borrowings under TILC Warehouse Loan facility. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we borrowed $533.5 million, net of debt issuance costs, primarily from the issuance by TRL-2017 of promissory notes and the issuance by TRIP Master Funding of secured railcar equipment notes. Additionally, we retired $375.3 million in debt, primarily consisting of previously-issued TRIP Master Funding secured railcar equipment notes. We also repurchased shares of our common stock under a share repurchase program as described further above. We intend to use our cash and committed credit facilities to fund our operations, expansions, and growth initiatives. Additionally, we may use our cash and committed credit facilities to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt prior to its stated maturity or repurchase shares of our common stock.\n2017 compared with 2016\nOperating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $610.1 million compared to $837.5 million for the same period in 2016. Cash flow provided by operating activities decreased primarily due to operating profit.\nReceivables at December 31, 2017 decreased by $117.2 million from December 31, 2016 primarily due to a lower income tax receivable. Raw materials inventory at December 31, 2017 decreased by $11.5 million since December 31, 2016, while work in process inventory increased by $2.8 million primarily in our Rail Products Group. Finished goods inventory increased by $0.1 million or 0.2% since December 31, 2016 due to higher inventory balances carried at the previous year end for scheduled shipments in early 2017 in our Rail Products Groups. Accounts payable increased by $12.2 million, while accrued liabilities increased by $49.0 million from December 31, 2016 due to higher compensation accruals.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash required by investing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $346.3 million compared to $942.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment and other assets totaled $368.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, including railcar sales from the lease fleet owned more than one year at the time of sale totaling $360.7 million. This compares to $48.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, including railcar sales from the lease fleet owned more than one year at the time of sale totaling $37.7 million. Short-term marketable securities for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased $84.8 million. There was no acquisition or divestiture activity for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash required by financing activities from continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $56.7 million compared to $307.7 million for the same period in 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we borrowed $533.5 million, net of debt issuance costs, primarily from the issuance by TRL-2017 of promissory notes and the issuance by TRIP Master Funding of secured railcar equipment notes. Additionally, we retired $375.3 million in debt, primarily consisting of previously-issued TRIP Master Funding secured railcar equipment notes. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we retired $162.0 million in debt as scheduled. Additionally, we repurchased shares of our stock under our prior share repurchase program.\nCurrent Debt Obligations\nPlease refer to Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company's current debt obligations.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures for 2018 were $985.6 million with $948.3 million utilized for net lease fleet additions, net of deferred profit of $77.2 million. Full-year manufacturing/corporate capital expenditures for 2019 are projected to range between $90 million and $110 million. Additionally, we expect to make capital expenditures for new lease fleet additions, secondary market purchases, modifications and other capitalized betterments of the lease fleet. In total, when combined with the proceeds from secondary market sales, and after taking into account deferred profit on new railcar additions, we anticipate a net lease fleet investment of between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion in 2019.\nEquity Investment\nSee Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our investment in partially-owned leasing subsidiaries.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had letters of credit issued under our Credit Agreement in an aggregate principal amount of $57.5 million, the full amount of which is expected to expire in 2019. The majority of our letters of credit obligations support our various insurance programs and generally renew by their terms each year. See Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about our corporate revolving credit facility.\nSee Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about off balance sheet arrangements with regard to our Leasing Group.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe may use derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, both in anticipation of future debt issuances and to offset interest rate variability of certain floating rate debt issuances outstanding. We also may use derivative instruments from time to time to mitigate the impact of changes in natural gas and diesel fuel prices and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are accounted for in accordance with applicable accounting standards. See Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of how we utilize our derivative instruments.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have a stock-based compensation plan covering our employees and our Board of Directors. See Note 16 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nEmployee Retirement Plans\nAs disclosed in Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, the assets of the employee retirement plans exceeded the projected benefit obligations by $25.5 million as of December 31, 2018, and the projected benefit obligations exceeded the plans' assets by $2.0 million as of December 31, 2017. The change was primarily due to employer contributions to the pension plans of $31.6 million during 2018 and an increase in the obligation discount rate assumption, partly offset by a lower return on assets in 2018. We continue to sponsor an employee savings plan under the existing 401(k) plan that covers substantially all domestic employees and includes both a Company matching contribution and an annual retirement contribution of up to 3% each of eligible compensation based on Company financial performance, as well as a Supplemental Profit Sharing Plan. Both the annual retirement contribution and the Company matching contribution are discretionary, requiring board approval, and made annually with the investment of the funds directed by the participants.\nEmployer contributions for the year ending December 31, 2019 are expected to be $1.1 million for the defined benefit plans, compared to $31.6 million contributed during 2018. Contributions to the defined benefit plans in 2018 included a one-time discretionary contribution of $25.0 million. Employer contributions to the 401(k) plans and the Supplemental Profit Sharing Plan for the year ending December 31, 2019 are expected to be $10.8 million, compared to $15.4 million contributed during 2018.\nSee Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our defined benefit plans.\nContractual Obligation and Commercial Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments: \n(1) Excludes unamortized discount and debt issuance costs.\n(2) Includes $763.9 million in purchase", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCompany Overview\nTrinity Industries, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries own businesses that are leading providers of rail transportation products and services in North America. Our rail-related businesses market their railcar products and services under the trade name TrinityRail\u00ae. The TrinityRail integrated business platform provides railcar leasing and management services, railcar manufacturing, and railcar maintenance and modification services. We also own businesses engaged in the manufacturing of products used on the nation's roadways and in traffic control, as well as a transportation business that provides support services to Trinity and a variety of other industrial manufacturers.\nOn November 1, 2018, we completed the separation of Trinity Industries, Inc. into two public companies: (1) Trinity Industries, Inc., comprised of Trinity's rail-related businesses, which are leading providers of rail transportation products and services in North America, and (2) Arcosa, Inc. (\"Arcosa\"), a new public company focused on infrastructure-related products and services. The separation was effected through a pro rata dividend to Trinity's shareholders of all outstanding Arcosa shares and was structured to qualify as a tax free distribution for federal income tax purposes. Following the distribution, Arcosa became an independent, publicly-traded company on the New York Stock Exchange. Trinity did not retain an ownership interest in Arcosa following the completion of the spin-off transaction. See Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the spin-off transaction.\nFollowing the Arcosa spin-off, Trinity now reports its financial results in three principal business segments: the Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group, the Rail Products Group, and the All Other Group. Our All Other segment includes the results of our highway products business, which was previously reported within our former Construction Products Group. Additionally, our heads business, which was previously reported in our former Energy Equipment Group, is now included within the Rail Products Group. Further, our axles and couplers businesses were previously included in our Rail Products Group and were transferred to Arcosa in connection with the spin-off.\nArcosa's results of operations have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this Annual Report on this Form 10-K. Additionally, all intersegment sales between Arcosa and us, previously recorded as intersegment sales and eliminated in consolidation prior to the Arcosa spin-off, are now reflected as third-party sales that, along with their related costs, are no longer eliminated in consolidation.\nAll segment results set forth herein have been recast to present results on a comparable basis.\nExecutive Summary\nFinancial and Operational Highlights\n \u2022 Our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $2,509.1 million representing an increase of 4.7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Although we experienced improvements in railcar orders and deliveries in 2018, marketplace conditions put downward pressure on pricing for certain railcar types. \n \u2022 Total railcar backlog at December 31, 2018 was $3,647.6 million, compared to $2,164.2 million at December 31, 2017. The Rail Products Group received railcar orders of 28,795 and delivered 20,105 railcars in 2018, in comparison to railcar orders of 12,900 and railcar deliveries of 18,395 in 2017. \n \u2022 The Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group (the \"Leasing Group\") reported additions to the wholly-owned and partially-owned lease fleet of 10,625 railcars in 2018, for a total of 99,215 railcars as of December 31, 2018, an increase of 12%. \n \u2022 The Leasing Group's lease fleet of 99,215 company-owned rail cars was 98.5% utilized as of December 31, 2018, in comparison to a lease fleet utilization of 96.8% on 88,590 company-owned railcars as of December 31, 2017. Our company-owned railcars includes wholly-owned, partially-owned, and railcars under sale-leaseback arrangements. \n \u2022 For 2018, after taking into account deferred profit on new railcar additions, modifications to the lease fleet, and the proceeds from the sales of leased railcars, we made a net investment in our lease fleet of approximately $948.3 million.  See \"Consolidated Results of Operations\" and \"Segment Discussion\" below for additional information regarding our operating results.\nDebt and Capital Allocation Updates\n \u2022 In November 2018, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program (the \"ASR Program\") to repurchase $350 million of the Company's common stock. The $350 million notional value of the ASR Program represents the entire remaining amount that was available to us under our existing share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 12.9 million shares have been delivered to us, representing approximately 80% of the total notional value of the ASR Program. The ASR Program is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2019, at which time the remaining shares will be delivered to the Company. \n \u2022 In November 2018, Trinity Rail Leasing 2017 LLC (\"TRL-2017\"), a Delaware limited liability company and a limited purpose, indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company owned through TILC, entered into an Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement to increase the aggregate amount of the term loan from $302.4 million under the Original Loan Agreement to $663.0 million and to extend the maturity date by approximately eighteen months to November 8, 2025. The proceeds from the expansion of TRL-2017 were used to fund the ASR Program described above. \n \u2022 In November 2018, we amended and restated our prior credit agreement, dated as of May 20, 2015 (as amended from time to time). The amended and restated Credit Agreement provides for a $450.0 million unsecured revolving line of credit with an extended maturity date of November 1, 2023. \n \u2022 In June 2018, Trinity Rail Leasing 2018 LLC (\"TRL-2018\"), a Delaware limited liability company and a limited purpose, indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company owned through TILC, issued $482.5 million of TRL-2018 Secured Railcar Equipment Notes. These notes have an ultimate maturity date of 2048. The net proceeds received from the transaction were used to repay a portion of the conversion settlement value of our convertible subordinated notes that were called for redemption at par on June 1, 2018 as described further below. \n \u2022 In April 2018, the Company issued a Notice of Redemption with respect to our then outstanding 3 7/8% convertible senior notes (the \"Convertible Notes\") to redeem these notes on June 1, 2018. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing these notes, the settlement of these notes submitted for conversion occurred on various dates between May 30, 2018 and July 3, 2018 and were settled in cash, at our election, for an aggregate cash amount of approximately $646.6 million. Following the redemption and settlement of the conversions, there were no Convertible Notes outstanding under the indenture, and the indenture was satisfied and discharged in accordance with its terms.  See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below for further information regarding these activities.\nLitigation Updates\nSee Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for an update on the status of the Company's Highway Products litigation.\nSubsequent Events\n \u2022 As previously disclosed, our Leasing Group leased railcars from certain independent owner Trusts under operating leases, which contained an option to purchase the railcars at a predetermined fixed price in 2019. In January 2018, the Leasing Group provided the Trusts with an irrevocable twelve-month notice of intent to exercise their option to purchase all of the Trusts' railcars. We completed the purchase in January 2019 at a purchase price of $218.4 million. As a result, 6,779 railcars previously under lease are now wholly owned by our Leasing Group. The purchase was funded using cash on hand and borrowings available to us under our revolving credit facility.  Cyclical Trends Impacting Our Business\nThe industries in which we operate are cyclical in nature. Weaknesses in certain sectors of the U.S. and global economy may make it more difficult to sell or lease certain types of railcars. Additionally, adverse changes in commodity prices or lower demand for certain commodities could result in a decline in customer demand for various types of railcars. We continuously assess demand for our products and services and take steps to align our manufacturing capacity appropriately and rationalize and diversify our leased railcar portfolio. Due to their transactional nature, railcar sales from the lease fleet are the primary driver of fluctuations in results in the Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group. Results in our All Other Group are affected by seasonal fluctuations, with the second and third quarters historically being the quarters with the highest revenues.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,509.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,397.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,089.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenues\n</td> <td>1,938.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,775.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,312.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, engineering, and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>296.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>339.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>313.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gains on disposition of property\n</td> <td>41.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating profit\n</td> <td>315.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>368.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>478.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>167.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>173.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>176.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net\n</td> <td>(3.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes\n</td> <td>151.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>195.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>310.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision (benefit) for income taxes\n</td> <td>42.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(414.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>610.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>203.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nThe tables below present revenue by segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent Change 2018 versus 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>External\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Intersegment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>842.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>842.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rail Products Group\n</td> <td>1,356.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>990.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,346.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All Other\n</td> <td>310.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>361.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Totals before Eliminations\n</td> <td>2,509.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,041.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,550.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Eliminations -

Previously reported amounts have been recast to conform to the current presentation.\nDiscussion of Consolidated Results\nRevenue - Our revenues for 2018 were $2,509.1 million, representing an increase of $111.7 million, or 4.7%, over last year. The increase in revenues for 2018 when compared to the previous year resulted primarily from higher railcar sales volumes and an increase in railcar modifications performed by our maintenance services business, partly offset by pricing pressures on certain railcar types. Our revenues for 2017 were $2,397.4 million, representing a decrease of 22.4% when compared with 2016, primarily as a result of reduced volumes and product mix changes.\nCost of Revenues - Our cost of revenues for 2018 were $1,938.8 million, representing an increase of $163.6 million, or 9.2%, over last year. The increase in cost of revenues for 2018, when compared to the previous year, resulted primarily from higher volumes in our railcar manufacturing and maintenance services businesses and increased depreciation expense associated with the growth of our lease fleet. Cost of revenues for 2017 were $1,775.2 million, representing a decrease of $536.8 million, or 23.2%, over 2016, primarily driven by reduced volumes.\nSelling, engineering, and administrative expenses - Selling, engineering, and administrative expenses decreased by 12.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018, when compared to the prior year primarily due to a reduction in litigation-related expenses. Selling, engineering, and administrative expenses increased by 8.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017, when compared to the prior year primarily due to higher performance-related compensation and litigation-related expenses.\nGains on disposition of property - Gains on disposition of property decreased by $44.0 million, or 51.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, when compared to the prior year primarily due to lower sales of leased railcars, as well as a non-cash charge of $12.6 million associated with our election to forego the early purchase options contained in certain lease agreements. Gains on the disposition of property increased by $70.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to higher sales of leased railcars in 2017 when compared to 2016.\nOperating profit - Operating profit for 2018 totaled $315.1 million, representing a decrease of 14.4% from prior year. The decrease in operating profit for 2018 when compared to 2017 resulted primarily from pricing pressures on certain railcar types in our railcar manufacturing business and lower lease rates in our leasing business. The decrease in operating profit was slightly offset by a reduction in selling, engineering and administrative expenses, and higher volumes and operating efficiencies in our Rail Products Group. Operating profits for the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $368.3 million, representing a decrease of 23.1% from the prior year. The decrease in operating profit for 2017 was primarily driven by lower shipment volumes, partly offset by a higher volume of sales of leased railcars and higher leasing and management operating profit as a result of growth in the lease fleet.\nFor further information regarding the operating results of individual segments, see \"Segment Discussion\" below.\nInterest Expense, Net - Interest expense, net for 2018 totaled $167.4 million, compared to $173.6 million for 2017.\nOther, Net - We reported income in other, net of $3.9 million in 2018, representing an increase of $3.2 million over 2017. The increase was primarily due to lower net periodic benefit costs associated with our company-sponsored pension plans.\nIncome Taxes - The effective tax expense (benefit) rates for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 were 28.1%, (212.2)%, and 34.5%, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2018 reflects the lower 21% federal statutory rate that took effect January 1, 2018 in connection with the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"). The 2018, 2017, and 2016 effective tax rates differ from the federal tax rate of 21%, 35%, and 35%, respectively, as the effective tax rates include the impacts of state income tax expense, income attributable to the noncontrolling interests in partially-owned leasing subsidiaries for which no income tax expense is provided, excess tax deficiencies (benefits) related to equity compensation, the completion of income tax audits that resulted in a net tax benefit and certain other differences.\nIncome tax payments, net of refunds, differ from the current provision primarily based on when estimated tax payments were due as compared to when the related income was earned and taxable. Our consolidated income tax position was a net receivable of $38.4 million and $20.2 million from federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Income tax payments (refunds) during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 totaled $4.1 million, $(79.9) million, and $(65.5) million, respectively.\nSee Note 13 of the Consolidated

Amortization of deferred profit on railcars sold from the Rail Products Group to the Leasing Group is included in the operating profits of the Leasing Group resulting in the recognition of depreciation expense based on our original manufacturing cost of the railcars. Interest expense is not a component of operating profit and includes the effect of hedges.\nTotal revenues for the Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group were substantially unchanged for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to 2017. Revenues attributable to sales of leased railcars owned one year or less were higher in 2018 when compared to 2017, due to a higher volume of railcars sold partially offset by a change in the mix of the types of cars sold from the fleet. Additionally, leasing and management revenues decreased 2.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to 2017, primarily as a result of lower average rental rates, as well as lower lease fleet management advisory fees earned in the current year, partially offset by growth in the lease fleet.\nTotal revenues increased by 2.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to growth in leasing and management revenues, partially offset by a lower volume of sales of leased railcars owned one year or less. Leasing and management revenues increased 6.1% due primarily to growth in the lease fleet, higher lease fleet management advisory fees, and a cancellation fee received in October 2017, partially offset by the effect of lower average rental rates.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 the Leasing Group received total proceeds from the sale of leased railcars as follows:\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing Group:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales of railcars owned one year or less at the time of sale\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>126.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Railcars owned more than one year at the time of sale\n</td> <td>230.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>360.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rail Products Group\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>344.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>460.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>171.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating profit decreased by 21.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to a decline in operating profit attributable to our leasing and management services business. This decrease of 14.5% was primarily the result of higher depreciation and maintenance and compliance expenses associated with the growth of the lease fleet, lower average rental rates, and lower lease fleet management advisory fees earned in comparison to the prior year. Additionally, segment operating profit was impacted by a decrease in sales of railcars owned more than one year at the time of sale, a change in the mix of of the types of railcars sold from the fleet, and a non-cash charge of $12.6 million associated with our election to forego the early purchase options contained in certain lease agreements.\nOperating profit increased by 23.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a higher volume of sales of leased railcars. Leasing and management operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by 9.2% due to growth in the lease fleet, higher lease fleet management advisory fees, and lower fleet maintenance and compliance expense.\nThe Leasing Group generally uses its non-recourse warehouse loan facility or cash to provide initial funding for a portion of the purchase price of the railcars. After initial funding, the Leasing Group may obtain long-term financing for the railcars in the lease fleet through non-recourse asset-backed securities; long-term non-recourse operating leases pursuant to sales/leaseback transactions; long-term recourse debt such as equipment trust certificates; long-term non-recourse promissory notes; or third-party equity.\nInformation regarding the

December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 reflect the removal of 400, 1,140, and 250 railcars, respectively, that have not been netted against orders.\nRevenues and cost of revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 by 14.8% and 18.2%, respectively, when compared to the prior year. These increases primarily resulted from a higher volume of railcar deliveries and product mix changes, partially offset by pricing pressures related to certain railcar types. The increase in revenues was also driven by growth in our maintenance services business.\nRevenues decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017 by 32.5% when compared to 2016 with approximately 94% of the decrease in Rail Products Group revenue resulting from a decrease in unit deliveries with the remainder primarily due to product mix changes. Cost of revenues decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017 by 28.8% when compared with the prior year primarily due to a decrease in unit deliveries.\nOperating profit decreased for the year ended December 31, 2018 by 12.3% when compared to 2017 primarily as a result of pricing pressures for certain railcar types and product mix changes, partially offset by a higher volume of railcar deliveries and growth in our maintenance services business. Selling, engineering, and administrative costs were substantially unchanged for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to 2017.\nOperating profit decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017 by 56.3% when compared to 2016 primarily as a result of a decrease in railcar unit deliveries. Additionally, operating profit in 2017 was impacted by changes to pricing and product mix.\nTotal backlog dollars increased by 68.5% when comparing December 31, 2018 to the prior year, primarily resulting from an increase in railcar unit orders, and a 23.3% higher average selling price on new orders compared to the previous year, driven primarily by changes to the product mix and fluctuations in steel prices. Backlog decreased when comparing 2017 versus 2016 due to unit decreases and lower prices. The average selling price in the backlog at December 31, 2017 was 6.9% lower as compared to the previous year primarily due to pricing and product mix changes. Approximately 64% of our railcar backlog is expected to be delivered during the year ending December 31, 2019 with the remainder to be delivered thereafter into 2023. The orders in our backlog from the Leasing Group are fully supported by lease commitments with external customers. The final amount of backlog\nattributable to the Leasing Group may vary by the time of delivery as customers may choose to purchase railcars from the Rail Products Group rather than lease.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, railcar shipments included sales to the Leasing Group of $876.0 million with a deferred profit of $77.2 million, representing 9,013 railcars, compared to $732.0 million with a deferred profit of $92.0 million, representing 7,745 railcars, in the comparable period in 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, railcar shipments included sales to the Leasing Group of $1,021.9 million with a deferred profit of $178.2 million, representing 9,385 railcars. Sales to the Leasing Group and related profits are included in the operating results of the Rail Products Group but are eliminated in consolidation. In 2018, the Leasing Group purchased 44.8% of our railcar production, compared to 42.1% in 2017 and 34.5% in 2016.\nAll Other\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 versus 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 versus 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Highway Products\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>267.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>245.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>271.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>361.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>333.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>356.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating costs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenues\n</td> <td>284.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>271.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>295.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, engineering, and administrative costs\n</td> <td>44.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property disposition (gains) losses\n</td> <td>(3.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Not meaningful\nRevenues, cost of revenues, and operating profit increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to higher shipping volumes and changes in the mix of products sold in our highway products portfolio. Cost of revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 by $12.6 million over the prior year primarily due to higher volumes. Included in cost of revenues are insurance recoveries of $11.8 million related to damages previously sustained at two highway products manufacturing facilities, which were partially offset by certain manufacturing inefficiencies in our highway products business. Selling, engineering, and administrative costs decreased 27.4% compared to the previous year primarily as a result of lower litigation related expenses.\nRevenues and cost of revenues decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to lower volumes in our highway products business, partially offset by higher volumes in our other businesses.\nCorporate\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 versus 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 versus 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>149.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>175.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 is primarily due to lower litigation-related expenses and consulting fees, partially offset by higher performance-related incentive compensation costs related to the spin-off.\nThe increase in operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 is primarily due to higher litigation-related expenses and performance-related incentive compensation costs.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nWe expect to finance future operating requirements with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities; cash flows from operations; and short-term debt, long-term debt, and equity. Debt instruments that we have utilized include the TILC warehouse facility, senior notes, convertible subordinated notes, asset-backed securities, non-recourse promissory notes, sale-leaseback transactions, and our revolving credit facility.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balances of $179.2 million, and $392.5 million available under our revolving credit facility. Under the TILC warehouse facility, $375.2 million was unused and available as of December 31, 2018 based on the amount of warehouse-eligible, unpledged equipment. We believe we have access to adequate capital resources to fund operating requirements and are an active participant in the capital markets.\nStrategic Activities in 2018 Impacting Liquidity\nExpansion of TRL -2017 Loan - On November 8, 2018, TRL-2017, entered into an Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement (the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement\u201d) among the lenders party thereto, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, as Administrative Agent, and U.S. Bank National Association, as Collateral Agent, Custodian and Depositary. The Amended and Restated Loan Agreement amends and restates the Term Loan Agreement dated as of May 15, 2017 (the Original Loan Agreement\u201d) among the lenders party thereto, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, as Administrative Agent, and U.S. Bank National Association, as Collateral Agent, Custodian and Depositary. The Amended and Restated Loan Agreement:\n \u2022 increased the aggregate amount of the term loan from $302.4 million under the Original Loan Agreement to $663.0 million; \n \u2022 extended the maturity date by approximately eighteen months to November 8, 2025; \n \u2022 reduced the applicable interest rate to LIBOR plus 150 basis points from LIBOR plus 175 basis points under the Original Loan Agreement; and \n \u2022 added additional railcars to the collateral pool of railcars securing the borrower's obligations under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement.  Amendment of Revolving Credit Facility - On November 1, 2018, in connection with the Arcosa spin-off, Trinity entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d), by and among Trinity, as borrower, the lenders party thereto (the Lenders\u201d), JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association ( JP Morgan\u201d), as administrative agent, Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent, and SunTrust Bank and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as co-documentation agents. The Credit Agreement replaced Trinity's prior credit agreement, dated as of May 20, 2015. The Credit Agreement provides for a $450.0 million unsecured revolving line of credit with a maturity date of November 1, 2023. The Credit Agreement includes a $100.0 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. Trinity may also increase the amount of the commitments under the Credit Agreement by an aggregate amount not to exceed $200.0 million, subject to certain conditions including the agreement of existing Lenders to increase their commitments or by obtaining commitments from one or more new Lenders. As of December 31, 2018, we had letters of credit issued under our Credit Agreement in an aggregate principal amount of $57.5 million, leaving $392.5 million available for borrowing. Other than these letters of credit, there were no borrowings under our Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2018, or for the year then ended.\nSecondary Market Railcar Purchase - On October 17, 2018, our Railcar Leasing and Management Services group acquired, from an unrelated seller, a portfolio of railcars for $75.4 million in cash. As a result of the purchase transaction, the Leasing Group acquired approximately 4,150 railcars, substantially all of which are currently under lease to third parties, and assumed indebtedness of approximately $283.9 million with maturities ranging from 2018 through 2035. We have recorded the acquired railcars, the attached leases, and the assumed debt at fair value in our Consolidated Financial Statements as of the purchase date.\nRedemption of Convertible Notes due 2036 - On April 23, 2018, the Company issued a Notice of Redemption to redeem our then-outstanding Convertible Notes on June 1, 2018 at a redemption price in cash equal to 100% of their principal amount plus accrued but unpaid interest (including any contingent interest), if any, to but excluding June 1, 2018 (the \"Redemption Date\"). Immediately prior to the Redemption Date, the aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes outstanding was approximately $449.3 million. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the Convertible Notes, the settlement of the Convertible Notes submitted for conversion occurred on various dates between May 30, 2018 and July 3, 2018. The Company elected to exercise its rights to settle the Convertible Notes in cash rather than in shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. The Company completed settlements for the remaining Convertible Notes, for an aggregate cash amount of approximately $646.6 million. Following the redemption and settlement of the conversions, there were no Convertible Notes outstanding under the indenture, and the indenture was satisfied and discharged in accordance with its terms. In connection with the election to settle the redemption of the Convertible Notes entirely with cash, the Company avoided the issuance of up to 5.7 million shares, valued at approximately $198.1 million and representing the amount in excess of par.\nTRL-2018 Railcar Financing - In June 2018, TRL-2018 issued $482.5 million of TRL-2018 Secured Railcar Equipment Notes. The TRL-2018 Secured Railcar Equipment Notes consisted of two classes of notes with (i) an aggregate principal amount of $200.0 million of Class A-1 Notes, and (ii) an aggregate principal amount of $282.5 million of Class A-2 Notes. The TRL-2018 Secured Railcar Equipment Notes were issued pursuant to a Master Indenture, dated June 20, 2018 between TRL-2018 and Wilmington Trust Company, as indenture trustee. The Class A-1 Notes, of which $190.0 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2018, bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.82%, are payable monthly, and have a stated final maturity date of June 17, 2048. The Class A-2 Notes, of which $282.5 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2018, bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.62%, are payable monthly, and have a stated final maturity date of June 17, 2048. These notes are obligations of TRL-2018 only, secured by a portfolio of railcars and operating leases thereon acquired and owned by TRL-2018, certain cash reserves, and other assets of TRL-2018.\nAmendment of TILC Warehouse Loan Facility - The TILC warehouse loan facility was established to finance railcars owned by TILC. In March 2018, the facility, previously totaling $1.0 billion, was extended through March 2021 at a reduced amount of $750.0 million at the Company's election. The principal and interest of this indebtedness are paid from the cash flows of the underlying leases. Advances under the facility bear interest at a defined index rate plus a margin, for an all-in interest rate of 4.11% at December 31, 2018. Outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2018 were $374.8 million, and $375.2 million was unused and available based on the amount of warehouse-eligible, unpledged equipment. Amounts outstanding at maturity, absent renewal, are payable under the renewed facility in March 2022.\nReturn of Capital Activities\nShare Repurchases - In December 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a new $500 million share repurchase program effective January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019. The new program replaced the previous program which then expired on December 31, 2017. In the first three quarters of 2018, we repurchased 4,327,158 shares at a cost of approximately $150.1 million. On November 16, 2018, we entered into the ASR Program to repurchase $350 million of the Company's common stock. The $350 million notional value of the ASR Program represents the entire remaining amount that was available to us under our existing share repurchase program. Under this program, 12,879,485 shares were repurchased during the three months ended December 31, 2018, at a cost of approximately $280.0 million, representing approximately 80% of the notional value of the ASR Program. These repurchases under the ASR Program bring our full-year share repurchases for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 17,206,643 shares at a cost of $430.1 million, excluding fees. This amount excludes $70.0 million that was funded in 2018 upon the execution of the ASR Program, but was outstanding at December 31, 2018 and is expected to be settled by the end of the first quarter of 2019. The final number of shares to be delivered to Trinity under the ASR Program will be based on Trinity's volume-weighted average stock price, less a discount, during the term of the program. Certain shares of stock repurchases during December 2017, totaling $6.0 million, were cash settled in January 2018 in accordance with normal settlement practices.\nQuarterly Cash Dividend - Trinity has paid 219 consecutive dividends. Quarterly dividends of $0.13 per share were paid in 2018, totaling approximately $75.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Two quarterly dividends of $0.11 per share and two quarterly dividends of $0.13 per share were paid in 2017, totaling approximately $75.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nCash Flows\nThe Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows include amounts related to discontinued operations, which are primarily related to the spin-off of Arcosa, completed on November 1, 2018. These amounts have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for each of the last three years:\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flows from continuing operations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>274.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>610.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>837.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(412.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(346.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(942.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>(291.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(56.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(307.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flows from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>(193.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>172.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(623.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>232.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(240.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 compared with 2017\nOperating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $274.2 million compared to $610.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Cash flow provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased primarily from decreased earnings in the current year period.\nReceivables at December 31, 2018 increased by $88.5 million or 38.7% from December 31, 2017 primarily due to higher trade receivables. Raw materials inventory increased $132.6 million to support railcar production in 2019, while work in process inventory decreased by $15.4 million, at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. Finished goods inventory increased by $4.7 million or 8.1% since December 31, 2017 primarily due to our highway products business. Accounts payable increased by $92.7 million, primarily as a result of the build-up of raw materials inventory to support 2019 railcar production noted above. Accrued liabilities increased by $51.5 million from December 31, 2017 primarily due to higher insurance accruals and payables related to the spin-off of Arcosa. We continually review reserves related to collectibility as well as the adequacy of lower of cost or net realizable value with regard to accounts receivable and inventory.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash required by investing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $412.3 million compared to $346.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $985.6 million, which included $1,040.7 million for investment in the lease fleet less $92.4 million for the cost of sold lease fleet railcars owned one year or less. This compares to $630.3 million of capital expenditures for the same period last year, which included $688.2 million for additions to the lease fleet less $79.9 million for the cost of sold lease fleet railcars owned one year or less. Proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment and other assets totaled $247.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, including railcar sales from the lease fleet owned more than one year at the time of sale totaling $230.5 million. This compares to $368.5 million for the same period in 2017, including railcar sales from the lease fleet owned more than one year at the time of sale totaling $360.7 million. Short-term marketable securities decreased by $319.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. There was no acquisition or divestiture activity for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. The Arcosa spin-off was a non-cash distribution of net assets and therefore did not impact investing activities.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash required by financing activities from continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $291.1 million compared to $56.7 million for the same period in 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we borrowed $1,206.6 million, net of debt issuance costs, primarily from the issuance by TRL-2018 of secured railcar equipment notes, the expansion of TRL-2017 promissory notes, and gross borrowings under the TILC Warehouse Loan facility. Additionally, we had debt repayments of $887.8 million in debt, primarily consisting of the redemption of our Convertible Notes and pay downs during 2018 of borrowings under TILC Warehouse Loan facility. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we borrowed $533.5 million, net of debt issuance costs, primarily from the issuance by TRL-2017 of promissory notes and the issuance by TRIP Master Funding of secured railcar equipment notes. Additionally, we retired $375.3 million in debt, primarily consisting of previously-issued TRIP Master Funding secured railcar equipment notes. We also repurchased shares of our common stock under a share repurchase program as described further above. We intend to use our cash and committed credit facilities to fund our operations, expansions, and growth initiatives. Additionally, we may use our cash and committed credit facilities to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt prior to its stated maturity or repurchase shares of our common stock.\n2017 compared with 2016\nOperating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $610.1 million compared to $837.5 million for the same period in 2016. Cash flow provided by operating activities decreased primarily due to operating profit.\nReceivables at December 31, 2017 decreased by $117.2 million from December 31, 2016 primarily due to a lower income tax receivable. Raw materials inventory at December 31, 2017 decreased by $11.5 million since December 31, 2016, while work in process inventory increased by $2.8 million primarily in our Rail Products Group. Finished goods inventory increased by $0.1 million or 0.2% since December 31, 2016 due to higher inventory balances carried at the previous year end for scheduled shipments in early 2017 in our Rail Products Groups. Accounts payable increased by $12.2 million, while accrued liabilities increased by $49.0 million from December 31, 2016 due to higher compensation accruals.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash required by investing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $346.3 million compared to $942.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $630.3 million, which included $688.2 million for investment in the lease fleet less $79.9 million for the cost of sold lease fleet railcars owned one year or less. This compares to $848.6 million of capital expenditures for the same period in 2016, which included $891.1 million for additions to the lease fleet less $92.0 million for the cost of sold lease fleet railcars owned one year or less. Proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment and other assets totaled $368.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, including railcar sales from the lease fleet owned more than one year at the time of sale totaling $360.7 million. This compares to $48.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, including railcar sales from the lease fleet owned more than one year at the time of sale totaling $37.7 million. Short-term marketable securities for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased $84.8 million. There was no acquisition or divestiture activity for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash required by financing activities from continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $56.7 million compared to $307.7 million for the same period in 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we borrowed $533.5 million, net of debt issuance costs, primarily from the issuance by TRL-2017 of promissory notes and the issuance by TRIP Master Funding of secured railcar equipment notes. Additionally, we retired $375.3 million in debt, primarily consisting of previously-issued TRIP Master Funding secured railcar equipment notes. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we retired $162.0 million in debt as scheduled. Additionally, we repurchased shares of our stock under our prior share repurchase program.\nCurrent Debt Obligations\nPlease refer to Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company's current debt obligations.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures for 2018 were $985.6 million with $948.3 million utilized for net lease fleet additions, net of deferred profit of $77.2 million. Full-year manufacturing/corporate capital expenditures for 2019 are projected to range between $90 million and $110 million. Additionally, we expect to make capital expenditures for new lease fleet additions, secondary market purchases, modifications and other capitalized betterments of the lease fleet. In total, when combined with the proceeds from secondary market sales, and after taking into account deferred profit on new railcar additions, we anticipate a net lease fleet investment of between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion in 2019.\nEquity Investment\nSee Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our investment in partially-owned leasing subsidiaries.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had letters of credit issued under our Credit Agreement in an aggregate principal amount of $57.5 million, the full amount of which is expected to expire in 2019. The majority of our letters of credit obligations support our various insurance programs and generally renew by their terms each year. See Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about our corporate revolving credit facility.\nSee Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about off balance sheet arrangements with regard to our Leasing Group.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe may use derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, both in anticipation of future debt issuances and to offset interest rate variability of certain floating rate debt issuances outstanding. We also may use derivative instruments from time to time to mitigate the impact of changes in natural gas and diesel fuel prices and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are accounted for in accordance with applicable accounting standards. See Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of how we utilize our derivative instruments.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have a stock-based compensation plan covering our employees and our Board of Directors. See Note 16 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nEmployee Retirement Plans\nAs disclosed in Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, the assets of the employee retirement plans exceeded the projected benefit obligations by $25.5 million as of December 31, 2018, and the projected benefit obligations exceeded the plans' assets by $2.0 million as of December 31, 2017. The change was primarily due to employer contributions to the pension plans of $31.6 million during 2018 and an increase in the obligation discount rate assumption, partly offset by a lower return on assets in 2018. We continue to sponsor an employee savings plan under the existing 401(k) plan that covers substantially all domestic employees and includes both a Company matching contribution and an annual retirement contribution of up to 3% each of eligible compensation based on Company financial performance, as well as a Supplemental Profit Sharing Plan. Both the annual retirement contribution and the Company matching contribution are discretionary, requiring board approval, and made annually with the investment of the funds directed by the participants.\nEmployer contributions for the year ending December 31, 2019 are expected to be $1.1 million for the defined benefit plans, compared to $31.6 million contributed during 2018. Contributions to the defined benefit plans in 2018 included a one-time discretionary contribution of $25.0 million. Employer contributions to the 401(k) plans and the Supplemental Profit Sharing Plan for the year ending December 31, 2019 are expected to be $10.8 million, compared to $15.4 million contributed during 2018.\nSee Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our defined benefit plans.\nContractual Obligation and Commercial Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Table 91: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 Year\nor Less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2-3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Parent and wholly-owned subsidiaries(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,739.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>125.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>264.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>584.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,764.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Partially-owned subsidiaries(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,327.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,048.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>778.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>172.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>310.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>185.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,845.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>344.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>687.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>890.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,922.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing Group\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>261.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>231.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Obligations for purchase of goods and services(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>834.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>800.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,951.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,381.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>739.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>905.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,925.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Excludes unamortized discount and debt issuance costs.\n(2) Includes $763.9 million in purchase"}
