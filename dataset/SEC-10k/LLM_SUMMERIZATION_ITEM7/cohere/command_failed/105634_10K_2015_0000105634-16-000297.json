MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe are one of the largest electrical and mechanical construction and facilities services firms in the United States. In addition, we provide a number of building services and industrial services. Our services are provided to a broad range of commercial, industrial, utility and institutional customers through approximately 70 operating subsidiaries and joint venture entities. Our offices are located in the United States and the United Kingdom.\nOperating Segments\nWe have the following reportable segments which provide services associated with the design, integration, installation, start-up, operation and maintenance of various systems: (a) United States electrical construction and facilities services (involving systems for electrical power transmission and distribution; premises electrical and lighting systems; low-voltage systems, such as fire alarm, security and process control; voice and data communication; roadway and transit lighting; and fiber optic lines); (b) United States mechanical construction and facilities services (involving systems for heating, ventilation, air conditioning, refrigeration and clean-room process ventilation; fire protection; plumbing, process and high-purity piping; controls and filtration; water and wastewater treatment; central plant heating and cooling; cranes and rigging; millwrighting; and steel fabrication, erection and welding); (c) United States building services; (d) United States industrial services; and (e) United Kingdom building services. The United States building services\u201d and United Kingdom building services\u201d segments principally consist of those operations which provide a portfolio of services needed to support the operation and maintenance of customers' facilities, including commercial and government site-based operations and maintenance; facility maintenance and services, including reception, security and catering services; outage services to utilities and industrial plants; military base operations support services; mobile maintenance and services; floor care and janitorial services; landscaping, lot sweeping and snow removal; facilities management; vendor management; call center services; installation and support for building systems; program development, management and maintenance for energy systems; technical consulting and diagnostic services; infrastructure and building projects for federal, state and local governmental agencies and bodies; and small modification and retrofit projects, which services are not generally related to customers' construction programs. The segment United States industrial services\u201d principally consists of those operations which provide industrial maintenance and services, including those for refineries and petrochemical plants, including on-site repairs, maintenance and service of heat exchangers, towers, vessels and piping; design, manufacturing, repair and hydro blast cleaning of shell and tube heat exchangers and related equipment; refinery turnaround planning and engineering services; specialty welding services; overhaul and maintenance of critical process units in refineries and petrochemical plants; and specialty technical services for refineries and petrochemical plants.\nWe acquired three companies in 2015, each for an immaterial amount. Two of the companies acquired primarily provide mechanical construction services, and their results of operations have been included in our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment. The results of operations for the other company acquired have been included in our United States building services segment.\nWe completed the acquisition of RepconStrickland, Inc. ( RSI\u201d) during 2013, and its results have been included in our United States industrial services segment since its acquisition. In addition, we completed two other acquisitions during 2013, and their results have been included in our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment. These acquired businesses expanded our service capabilities into new technical areas.\n2015 versus 2014\nOverview\nThe following table presents selected financial data for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands, except percentages and per share data):\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,718,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,424,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues increase from prior year\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment loss on identifiable intangible assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of building\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>287,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>289,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income as a percentage of revenues\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>172,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>178,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to EMCOR Group, Inc.\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>172,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.59\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe results of our operations for 2015 set new Company records in terms of revenues and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. Our 2015 results included increased revenues from all of our reportable segments. In addition, excluding the impact of the $11.7 million gain on the sale of a building and the $1.5 million impairment loss on identifiable intangible assets in 2014, our operating income (operating income as a percentage of revenues) increased in 2015 compared to 2014. Our overall 2015 operating income and operating margin were favorably impacted by improved operating performance within: (a) our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment, partially attributable to revenues of $12.1 million recognized as a result of the settlement of a claim on an institutional project located in the southeastern United States, and (b) our United States building services segment, as a result of increased profitability within this segment's mobile mechanical and commercial site-based services operations.\nOur operating results for 2015 were negatively impacted by: (a) our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment, (b) our United States industrial services segment and (c) our United Kingdom building services segment. Decreases in both operating income and operating margin within our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment were partially attributable to approximately $10.1 million of losses incurred on several transportation projects. Decreases in both operating income and operating margin within our United States industrial services segment were primarily due to: (a) the negative impact of a nationwide strike by union employees of certain major oil refineries in the first half of 2015, which led to both deferrals and losses of certain turnaround projects that generate relatively high gross profit margins, and (b) a decrease in the billing rates and related gross profit margins within our industrial shop services operations due to competitive market conditions resulting from decreased demand for new heat exchangers as a result of volatility in crude oil prices that led to a curtailment in capital spending.\nTwo of the companies acquired in 2015, which are reported in our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment, generated incremental revenues of $12.5 million and less than $0.1 million of operating income, net of $0.3 million of amortization expense associated with identifiable intangible assets. The results of operations for the third company acquired in 2015, which are reported in our United States building services segment, were de minimis.\nDiscussion and Analysis of Results of Operations\nRevenues\nAs described in more detail below, revenues for 2015 were $6.7 billion compared to $6.4 billion for 2014. The increase in revenues for 2015 was primarily attributable to: (a) increased revenues from both of our domestic construction segments, (b) increased demand for our industrial field services within our United States industrial services segment and (c) increased revenues from our mobile mechanical services operations within our United States building services segment. Revenues increased within our United States industrial services segment despite a nationwide strike by union employees of certain major oil refineries that negatively impacted the first half of 2015.\nThe following table presents our revenues for each of our operating segments and the approximate percentages that each segment's revenues were of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands, except for percentages):\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nTotal\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues from unrelated entities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States electrical construction and facilities services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,367,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,311,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States mechanical construction and facilities services\n</td> <td>2,312,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,201,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States building services\n</td> <td>1,739,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,721,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States industrial services\n</td> <td>922,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>839,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total United States operations\n</td> <td>6,341,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,074,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United Kingdom building services\n</td> <td>377,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>350,444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total worldwide operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,718,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,424,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues of our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment were $1,367.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to revenues of $1,312.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in revenues from commercial, healthcare and manufacturing construction projects, partially offset by a decrease in revenues from institutional construction projects.\nOur United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $2,312.8 million, a $111.6 million increase compared to revenues of $2,201.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in revenues from commercial and institutional construction projects, partially offset by a decline in revenues from manufacturing, water and wastewater and transportation construction projects. The results for the year ended December 31, 2015 included $12.5 million of revenues generated by companies acquired in 2015.\nRevenues of our United States building services segment were $1,739.3 million and $1,721.3 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in revenues was primarily attributable to increased revenues from: (a) our mobile mechanical services operations, in part due to significant activity in the California and New England regions and increased project and retrofit activities, and (b) our energy services operations. These increases were partially offset by decreased revenues from: (a) our government site-based services operations as a result of the completion in 2014 of two large long-term site-based joint venture projects not renewed pursuant to rebid, (b) our commercial site-based services operations as a result of: (i) a decline in add-on project activities, (ii) a decrease in revenues from its snow removal activities, as a result of less snowfall in geographical areas in which many of our contracts are based on a per snow event basis, and (iii) a decrease in revenues from supplier management contracts.\nRevenues of our United States industrial services segment for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $82.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in revenues was primarily due to large capital and maintenance project activity within our industrial field services operations. Revenues increased within this segment despite a nationwide strike by union employees of certain major oil refineries that negatively impacted the first half of 2015.\nOur United Kingdom building services segment revenues were $377.5 million in 2015 compared to $350.4 million in 2014. The increase in revenues was due to an increase in activity in the commercial market attributable to several new contract awards as well as increased work under existing contracts. The increase in revenues was partially offset by a decrease of $29.2 million relating to the effect of unfavorable exchange rates for the British pound versus the United States dollar.\nBacklog\nThe following table presents our operating segment backlog from unrelated entities and their respective percentages of total backlog (in thousands, except for percentages):\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nTotal\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Backlog:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States electrical construction and facilities services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,145,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,176,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States mechanical construction and facilities services\n</td> <td>1,683,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,473,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States building services\n</td> <td>762,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>732,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States industrial services\n</td> <td>54,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total United States operations\n</td> <td>3,646,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,483,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United Kingdom building services\n</td> <td>125,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total worldwide operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,771,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,633,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur backlog at December 31, 2015 was $3.77 billion compared to $3.63 billion at December 31, 2014. This increase in backlog was primarily attributable to an increase in backlog from our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment and our United States building services segment, partially offset by lower backlog from our other reportable segments. Backlog increases with awards of new contracts and decreases as we perform work on existing contracts. Backlog is not a term recognized under United States generally accepted accounting principles; however, it is a common measurement used in our industry. We include a project within our backlog at such time as a contract is awarded and agreement on contract terms has been reached. Backlog includes unrecognized revenues to be realized from uncompleted construction contracts plus unrecognized revenues expected to be realized over the remaining term of services contracts. However, we do not include in backlog contracts for which we are paid on a time and material basis and a fixed amount cannot be determined, and if the remaining term of a services contract exceeds 12 months, the unrecognized revenues attributable to such contract included in backlog are limited to only the next 12 months of revenues provided for in the contract award. Our backlog also includes amounts related to services contracts for which a fixed price contract value is not assigned when a reasonable estimate of total revenues can be made from budgeted amounts agreed to with our customer. Our backlog is comprised of: (a) original contract amounts, (b) change orders for which we have received written confirmations from our customers, (c) pending change orders for which we expect to receive confirmations in the ordinary course of business and (d) claim amounts that we have made against customers for which we have determined we have a legal basis under existing contractual arrangements and as to which we consider recovery to be probable. Such claim amounts were immaterial for all periods presented. Our backlog does not include anticipated revenues from unconsolidated joint ventures or variable interest entities and anticipated revenues from pass-through costs on contracts for which we are acting in the capacity of an agent and which are reported on the net basis. We believe our backlog is firm, although many contracts are subject to cancellation at the election of our customers. Historically, cancellations have not had a material adverse effect on us.\nCost of sales and Gross profit\nThe following table presents cost of sales, gross profit (revenues less cost of sales), and gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of revenues) for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands, except for percentages):\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,774,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,517,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>944,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>907,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit margin\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $944.5 million, a $37.2 million increase compared to the gross profit of $907.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our gross profit margin was 14.1% for both 2015 and 2014. Favorable variances in both gross profit and gross profit margin within: (a) our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment, which included revenues of $12.1 million recognized as a result of the settlement of a claim on an institutional project located in the southeastern United States, and (b) our United States building services segment were partially offset by decreases in gross profit and gross profit margin within our United Kingdom building services and our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment. Gross profit within our United States industrial services segment slightly increased; however, gross margin within this segment declined due to a decrease in the billing rates and related gross profit margins within our industrial shop services operations due to competitive market conditions resulting from decreased demand for new heat exchangers as a result of volatility in crude oil prices that led to a curtailment in capital spending.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nThe following table presents selling, general and administrative expenses and SG&A margin (selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues) for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands, except for percentages):\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>656,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>626,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues\n</td> <td>9.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $656.6 million, a $30.1 million increase compared to selling, general and administrative expenses of $626.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 9.8% for both 2015 and 2014. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was due to higher employee related costs such as incentive compensation, salaries and medical insurance costs, as well as certain other costs including computer hardware and software expenses, partially offset by a decrease in legal costs. Increased incentive compensation was principally due to higher annual operating results within certain operations than in 2014, which resulted in increased accruals for their incentive compensation plans. The increase in salaries was attributable to an increase in headcount, commensurate with an increase in revenues, as well as cost of living adjustments and merit pay increases.\nRestructuring expenses\nRestructuring expenses were $0.8 million and $1.2 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The 2015 restructuring expenses included $0.9 million of employee severance obligations and the reversal of $0.1 million relating to the termination of leased facilities. The 2014 restructuring expenses included $0.6 million of employee severance obligations and $0.6 million relating to the termination of leased facilities. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the balance of restructuring related obligations yet to be paid was $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively. The majority of obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2014 was paid during 2015. The obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2015 will be paid during the first half of 2016.\nGain on sale of building\nOn July 22, 2014, we sold a building and land owned by one of our subsidiaries reported in the United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment. We recognized a gain of approximately $11.7 million on this transaction in the third quarter of 2014, which has been classified as a Gain on sale of building\u201d in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nImpairment loss on goodwill and identifiable intangible assets\nNo impairment of our identifiable intangible assets was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2015. In conjunction with our 2014 annual impairment test on October 1, we recognized a $1.5 million non-cash impairment charge related to subsidiary trade names within the United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment and the United States building services segment. The 2014 impairment primarily resulted from lower forecasted revenues from two companies within these segments. Additionally, no impairment of our goodwill was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nOperating income (loss)\nThe following table presents by segment our operating income (loss) and each segment's operating income (loss) as a percentage of such segment's revenues from unrelated entities for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands, except for percentages):\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nSegment\nRevenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nSegment\nRevenues\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States electrical construction and facilities services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States mechanical construction and facilities services\n</td> <td>138,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States building services\n</td> <td>70,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States industrial services\n</td> <td>56,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total United States operations\n</td> <td>347,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>334,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United Kingdom building services\n</td> <td>11,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate administration\n</td> <td>(71,642\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(68,578\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring expenses\n</td> <td>(824\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,168\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment loss on identifiable intangible assets\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,471\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of building\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total worldwide operations\n</td> <td>287,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>289,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other corporate items:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(8,932\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,075\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from continuing operations before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>278,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>281,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs described in more detail below, we had operating income of $287.1 million for 2015 compared to operating income of $289.9 million for 2014. Operating margin was 4.3% and 4.5% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. Included within operating income for 2014 was an $11.7 million gain on the sale of a building, resulting in a 0.2% impact on our consolidated operating margin for 2014.\nOperating income of our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $82.2 million compared to operating income of $90.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was due to a decrease in gross profit from transportation, institutional and manufacturing construction projects and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses due to higher employee related costs such as incentive compensation and salaries. The decrease in gross profit from transportation construction projects included approximately $10.1 million of losses incurred on several projects due to productivity issues and delays. The increase in incentive compensation was principally due to higher annual operating results within certain operations than in 2014, which resulted in increased accruals for certain of our incentive compensation plans. The decrease in operating income was partially offset by an increase in gross profit from: (a) commercial construction projects, partially due to profits recognized on contracts in the Mid-Atlantic region and (b) healthcare construction projects. The decrease in operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 was attributable to a decrease in gross profit margin, partially as a result of losses recorded on transportation projects, as well as an increase in the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to revenues resulting from an increase in incentive compensation due to higher annual operating results within certain operations than in 2014.\nOur United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $138.7 million, a $24.3 million increase compared to operating income of $114.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Operating income was favorably impacted by an increase in gross profit from institutional, commercial and manufacturing construction projects, partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. The results for 2015 included revenues of $12.1 million recognized as a result of the settlement of a claim on an institutional project located in the southeastern United States. The results for 2014 included the receipt of $3.0 million from former shareholders of a company we had acquired as a result of the settlement of a claim by us under the acquisition agreement; this payment has been recorded as a reduction of \"Cost of sales\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of an increase in incentive compensation due to higher annual operating results than in 2014, which resulted in increased accruals for certain of our incentive compensation plans. Companies acquired in 2015 generated operating income of less than $0.1 million, net of amortization expense of $0.3 million attributable to identifiable intangible assets. The increase in operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 was attributable to an increase in gross profit margin.\nOperating income of our United States building services segment was $70.5 million and $65.9 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to improved performance from: (a) our mobile mechanical services operations, partially due to increased profitability in projects, retrofits, repair services work and service contracts, and (b) our commercial site-based services operations, partially due to a reduction in legal costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in operating income from: (a) our energy services operations as, in 2014, we benefited from the successful completion of a large project and (b) our government site-based services operations as a result of the completion in 2014 of two large long-term site-based joint venture projects not renewed pursuant to rebid. The results for the year ended December 31, 2015 included income of approximately $2.7 million, net of associated legal costs, upon the favorable settlement of a claim by us against the former owner of a company we had previously acquired within our commercial site-based services operations. The increase in operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 was attributable to an increase in gross profit margin.\nOperating income of our United States industrial services segment for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $6.7 million compared to operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to: (a) a decrease in gross profit from our industrial shop services operations due to: (i) a decrease in the billing rates and related gross profit margins due to competitive market conditions resulting from decreased demand for new heat exchangers as a result of volatility in crude oil prices that led to a curtailment in capital spending and (ii) the mix of work, which included fewer repair projects than in 2014, that generate relatively high gross profit margins, (b) the negative impact of a nationwide strike by union employees of certain major oil refineries in the first half of 2015, which led to both deferrals and losses of certain turnaround projects that generate relatively high gross profit margins, and (c) an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses due to higher employee related costs such as salaries and employee benefits, partially as a result of increased headcount. The decrease in operating income was partially offset by large capital and maintenance project activity within our industrial field services operations. The decrease in operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 was attributable to a decrease in gross profit margin.\nOur United Kingdom building services segment's operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $11.6 million compared to operating income of $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in operating income and operating margin was primarily attributable to the impact of $4.8 million of income recognized in the second quarter of 2014 as a result of a reduction in the estimate of certain accrued contract costs that were no longer expected to be incurred. The overall decrease in gross profit in this segment was partially offset by an increase in gross profit from both new contract awards and increased project activity within the commercial market. This segment recorded a decrease in operating income of $0.9 million relating to the effect of unfavorable exchange rates for the British pound versus the United States dollar.\nOur corporate administration operating loss was $71.6 million for 2015 compared to $68.6 million in 2014. The increase in expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to an increase in certain employment costs, such as incentive compensation and salaries, as well as certain other expenses including legal costs. The increase in incentive compensation was partially due to higher awards earned than in 2014, which resulted in increased accruals for certain of our incentive compensation plans.\nNon-operating items\nInterest expense was $8.9 million and $9.1 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in interest expense for 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to lower borrowings outstanding.\nInterest income was $0.7 million and $0.8 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in interest income was primarily related to lower invested cash balances.\nFor joint ventures that have been accounted for using the consolidation method of accounting, noncontrolling interest represents the allocation of earnings to our joint venture partners who either have a minority-ownership interest in the joint venture or are not at risk for the majority of losses of the joint venture.\nOur 2015 income tax provision from continuing operations was $106.3 million compared to $103.5 million for 2014. The actual income tax rates on income from continuing operations before income taxes, less amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, were 38.1% and 37.4%, respectively. The increase in the 2015 income tax provision compared to 2014 was predominantly due to certain increases in the state tax provision attributable to the mix of earnings and the effect of a change in the United Kingdom statutory tax rate on deferred tax assets.\nDiscontinued operations\nDue to a historical pattern of losses in the construction operations of our United Kingdom segment and our negative assessment of construction market conditions in the United Kingdom for the foreseeable future, we announced during the quarter ended June 30, 2013 our decision to withdraw from the construction market in the United Kingdom. During the third quarter of 2014, we ceased construction operations in the United Kingdom. The results of the construction operations of our United Kingdom segment for all periods are presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements as discontinued operations.\n2014 versus 2013\nOverview\nThe following table presents selected financial data for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands, except percentages and per share data):\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,424,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,333,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues increase from prior year\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>647\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment loss on identifiable intangible assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of building\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>289,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>240,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income as a percentage of revenues\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>178,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to EMCOR Group, Inc.\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>123,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverall revenues, operating income and operating margin (operating income as a percentage of revenues) increased in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase in revenues is primarily attributable to higher revenues from our United States industrial services segment and our United Kingdom building services segment, partially offset by a decline in revenues from our (a) United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment, (b) United States building services segment and (c) United States electrical construction and facilities services segment. Companies acquired in 2013, which are reported in our United States industrial segment and our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment, generated incremental revenues of $231.2 million in 2014. This amount reflects acquired companies' revenues in 2014 only for the time period these entities were not owned by EMCOR in the comparable 2013 period.\nThe increases in operating income were primarily attributable to improved operating performance within all of our reportable segments, except for our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment and our United States building services segment. Operating income margins increased within all of our reportable segments, except for our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment and our United States industrial services segment. In addition, our operating income and operating margin were favorably impacted by an $11.7 million gain on the sale of a building. Companies acquired in 2013, which are reported in our United States industrial segment and our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment, contributed $9.3 million to operating income, net of $8.2 million of amortization expense associated with identifiable intangible assets. These amounts reflect acquired companies' operating results in 2014 only for the time period these entities were not owned by EMCOR in the comparable 2013 period.\nDiscussion and Analysis of Results of Operations\nRevenues\nAs described in more detail below, revenues for 2014 were $6.4 billion compared to $6.3 billion for 2013. The increase in revenues for 2014 was primarily attributable to revenues of $231.2 million attributable to companies acquired in 2013 (which reflects acquired companies' revenues in 2014 only for the time period these entities were not owned by EMCOR in the comparable 2013 period) and higher revenues from our United States industrial services segment and our United Kingdom building services segment. This increase was partially offset by lower revenues from our other reportable segments.\nThe following table presents our revenues for each of our operating segments and the approximate percentages that each segment's revenues were of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands, except for percentages):\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nTotal\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues from unrelated entities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States electrical construction and facilities services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,311,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,345,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States mechanical construction and facilities services\n</td> <td>2,201,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,329,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States building services\n</td> <td>1,721,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,794,978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States industrial services\n</td> <td>839,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>519,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total United States operations\n</td> <td>6,074,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,989,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United Kingdom building services\n</td> <td>350,444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>343,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total worldwide operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,424,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,333,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues of our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment were $1,312.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to revenues of $1,345.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenues from institutional and manufacturing construction projects, primarily in the southern California and Washington D.C. markets, as well as a decrease in revenues from water and wastewater construction projects. These decreases were partially offset by higher levels of work from transportation, commercial and healthcare projects.\nOur United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $2,201.2 million, a $128.6 million decrease compared to revenues of $2,329.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. This decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to a decline in revenues from manufacturing construction projects, partially as the result of the completion in 2013 of several large projects within this market sector, which were not replaced. This decrease was partially offset by: (a) an increase in revenues from commercial, hospitality and institutional construction projects and (b) incremental revenues of $19.2 million generated by companies acquired in 2013. This amount reflects acquired companies' revenues in 2014 only for the time period these entities were not owned by EMCOR in the comparable 2013 period.\nRevenues of our United States building services segment were $1,721.3 million and $1,795.0 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. This decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to decreased revenues from: (a) our commercial site-based services operations, as a result of a decline in revenues from supplier management contracts, including a large contract that was terminated by agreement of both parties, (b) our energy services operations, due to a reduction in large project work, and (c) our government site-based services operations, as a result of the completion of a large long-term site-based joint venture project located in the Pacific Northwest not renewed pursuant to rebid. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in revenues from our mobile mechanical service operations, primarily within the California and New England markets.\nRevenues of our United States industrial services segment for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $320.6 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. For the seven months ended July 31, 2014, RSI generated incremental revenues of $212.0 million. This amount reflects RSI's revenues in 2014 only for the time period RSI was not owned by EMCOR in the comparable 2013 period. The increase in revenues was also attributable to an increased demand for our industrial field services operations, partially offset by a decrease in revenues from our industrial shop services operations.\nOur United Kingdom building services segment revenues were $350.4 million in 2014 compared to $343.6 million in 2013. This increase in revenues was due to an increase of $16.9 million relating to the effect of favorable exchange rates for the British pound versus the United States dollar and increased activity within the commercial and healthcare markets, partially offset by decreased activity within the transportation and institutional markets.\nBacklog\nThe following table presents our operating segment backlog from unrelated entities and their respective percentages of total backlog (in thousands, except for percentages):\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nTotal\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Backlog:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States electrical construction and facilities services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,176,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>993,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States mechanical construction and facilities services\n</td> <td>1,473,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,325,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States building services\n</td> <td>732,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>761,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States industrial services\n</td> <td>101,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total United States operations\n</td> <td>3,483,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,175,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United Kingdom building services\n</td> <td>150,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>167,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total worldwide operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,633,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,343,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur backlog at December 31, 2014 was $3.63 billion compared to $3.34 billion at December 31, 2013. This increase in backlog was primarily attributable to an increase in contracts awarded for work in our: (a) United States electrical construction and facilities services segment and (b) United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment. Backlog increases with awards of new contracts and decreases as we perform work on existing contracts.\nCost of sales and Gross profit\nThe following table presents cost of sales, gross profit (revenues less cost of sales), and gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of revenues) for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands, except for percentages):\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,517,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,511,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>907,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>821,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit margin\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $907.2 million, an $85.6 million increase compared to the gross profit of $821.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to improved profitability within all of our reportable segments, except for our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment. Gross profit in 2013 within our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment was negatively impacted by aggregate losses of approximately $24.5 million from one of our subsidiaries at two projects located in the southeastern United States. Companies acquired in 2013 included in our United States industrial services segment and our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment contributed an aggregate of $35.9 million to gross profit in 2014. This amount reflects acquired companies' gross profit in 2014 only for the time period these entities were not owned by EMCOR in the comparable 2013 period.\nOur gross profit margin was 14.1% and 13.0% for 2014 and 2013, respectively. Gross profit margin for 2014 increased within most of our reportable segments. Our consolidated gross profit margin benefited from an increase in revenues from our United States industrial services segment, which historically generates higher gross profit margins than our other reportable segments. Gross profit margin for 2013 was adversely impacted by the two significant project write-downs reported in our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment, resulting in a 0.4% impact on consolidated gross profit margin.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nThe following table presents selling, general and administrative expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands, except for percentages):\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>626,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>580,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues\n</td> <td>9.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $626.5 million, a $45.8 million increase compared to selling, general and administrative expenses of $580.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 9.8% and 9.2% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. This increase in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily resulted from: (a) $26.6 million of\nexpenses directly related to companies acquired in 2013, including amortization expense of $8.2 million attributable to identifiable intangible assets (which reflect acquired companies' expenses in 2014 only for the time period these entities were not owned by EMCOR in the comparable 2013 period), (b) higher employee related costs such as incentive compensation and employee benefits and (c) higher legal costs, including the unfavorable settlement of a legal matter. In addition, our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased due to higher revenues from our United States industrial services segment, which has a higher fixed cost structure than our other reportable segments. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013 included $6.1 million of transaction costs associated with the acquisition of RSI. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013 were reduced by $6.8 million of income attributable to the reversal of contingent consideration accruals relating to acquisitions made prior to 2013.\nRestructuring expenses\nRestructuring expenses were $1.2 million and $0.6 million for 2014 and 2013, respectively. The 2014 restructuring expenses included $0.6 million of employee severance obligations and $0.6 million relating to the termination of leased facilities. The 2013 restructuring expenses included $0.5 million of employee severance obligations and $0.1 million relating to the termination of leased facilities. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the balance of restructuring related obligations yet to be paid was $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively. The majority of obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 were paid during 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nGain on sale of building\nOn July 22, 2014, we sold a building and land owned by one of our subsidiaries reported in the United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment. We recognized a gain of approximately $11.7 million on this transaction in the third quarter of 2014, which has been classified as a Gain on sale of building\u201d in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nImpairment loss on goodwill and identifiable intangible assets\nIn conjunction with our 2014 annual impairment test on October 1, we recognized a $1.5 million non-cash impairment charge related to subsidiary trade names within the United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment and the United States building services segment. The 2014 impairment primarily resulted from lower forecasted revenues from two companies within these segments. No impairment of our identifiable intangible assets was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2013. Additionally, no impairment of our goodwill was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.\nOperating income (loss)\nThe following table presents by segment our operating income (loss) and each segment's operating income (loss) as a percentage of such segment's revenues from unrelated entities for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands, except for percentages):\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nSegment\nRevenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nSegment\nRevenues\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States electrical construction and facilities services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>98,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States mechanical construction and facilities services\n</td> <td>114,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States building services\n</td> <td>65,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States industrial services\n</td> <td>63,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total United States operations\n</td> <td>334,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>297,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United Kingdom building services\n</td> <td>15,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate administration\n</td> <td>(68,578\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(69,891\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring expenses\n</td> <td>(1,168\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(647\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment loss on identifiable intangible assets\n</td> <td>(1,471\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of building\n</td> <td>11,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total worldwide operations\n</td> <td>289,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>240,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other corporate items:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(9,075\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,769\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from continuing operations before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>281,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>232,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs described in more detail below, we had operating income of $289.9 million for 2014 compared to operating income of $240.4 million for 2013. Operating margin was 4.5% and 3.8% for 2014 and 2013, respectively. Included within operating income for 2014 was an $11.7 million gain on the sale of a building, resulting in a 0.2% impact on our consolidated operating margin for 2014. Operating income for 2013 was negatively impacted by aggregate losses of approximately $24.5 million from one of our subsidiaries at two projects located in the southeastern United States, resulting in a 0.4% impact on our consolidated operating margin for 2013.\nOperating income of our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $90.9 million compared to operating income of $98.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily the result of a decrease in gross profit attributable to institutional, transportation, manufacturing and water and wastewater construction projects, as well as an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, mainly attributable to employment costs. This segment was also negatively impacted by project losses incurred from one of our subsidiaries whose operations we are in the process of closing. The decrease in operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily the result of an increase in the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to revenues.\nOur United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $114.4 million, a $20.7 million increase compared to operating income of $93.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Operating income was favorably impacted by an increase in gross profit from institutional, commercial, healthcare and hospitality construction projects, partially offset by a decrease in gross profit from manufacturing and transportation construction projects. The results for 2014 included the receipt of $3.0 million from former shareholders of a company we had acquired as a result of the settlement of a claim by us under the acquisition agreement; this payment has been recorded as a reduction of \"Cost of sales\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The results for 2013 included aggregate losses of approximately $24.5 million from one of our subsidiaries at two projects located in the southeastern United States, resulting in a 1.1% impact on this segment's operating margin, partially offset by $6.7 million of income attributable to the reversal of contingent consideration accruals related to acquisitions made prior to 2013. Companies acquired in 2013 generated operating income of $0.9 million, net of amortization expense of $0.2 million attributable to identifiable intangible assets, for the year ended December 31, 2014. These amounts reflect acquired companies' operating results in 2014 only for the time period these entities were not owned by EMCOR in the comparable 2013 period. The increase in operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2014 was attributable to an increase in gross profit margin.\nOperating income of our United States building services segment was $65.9 million and $67.2 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to a decrease in operating income from this segment's: (a) commercial site-based services operations, due to: (i) decreased volume from supplier management contracts and (ii) higher legal costs, including the unfavorable settlement of a legal matter, and (b) energy services operations, due to a reduction of large project work. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in gross profit from this segment's: (a) mobile mechanical services operations, partially due to increased profitability in projects, retrofits and repair services work and (b) government site-based services operations, partially due to the successful close-out of two large long-term joint venture projects and reduced selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase in operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2014 was attributable to an increase in gross profit margin.\nOperating income of our United States industrial services segment for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $24.4 million compared to operating income for the year ended December 31, 2013. For the seven months ended July 31, 2014, RSI contributed $8.4 million of operating income, net of $8.0 million of amortization expense attributable to identifiable intangible assets. These amounts reflect RSI's operating results in 2014 only for the time period RSI was not owned by EMCOR in the comparable 2013 period. Operating income also benefited from an increase in demand for this segment's industrial field services. The increase in operating income was partially offset by a reduction in operating income from our industrial shop services operations, which had benefited from exceptionally strong demand during the first quarter of 2013.\nOur United Kingdom building services segment's operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $15.0 million compared to operating income of $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. This segment recognized income of $4.8 million during the second quarter of 2014, which has been recorded as a reduction of \"Cost of sales\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, as a result of a reduction in the estimate of certain accrued contract costs that were no longer expected to be incurred, which was partially offset by a decrease in income from the commercial and transportation markets. The increase in operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2014 was attributable to an increase in gross profit margin and a decrease in the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to revenues.\nOur corporate administration operating loss was $68.6 million for 2014 compared to $69.9 million in 2013. Our corporate administration operating loss for 2013 included $6.1 million of transaction costs associated with the acquisition of RSI. The benefit of the absence of these transaction costs for 2014 was partially offset by an increase in certain employment costs, such as incentive\ncompensation and employee benefits. Also, our corporate administration operating loss for 2013 was reduced by the receipt of an insurance recovery of approximately $2.6 million that was received in January 2013 associated with a previously disposed of operation, which is classified as a component of \"Cost of sales\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nNon-operating items\nInterest expense was $9.1 million and $8.8 million for 2014 and 2013, respectively. The $0.3 million increase in interest expense for 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to increased borrowings associated with the term loan executed in November 2013.\nInterest income was $0.8 million and $1.1 million for 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decrease in interest income was primarily related to lower invested cash balances.\nFor joint ventures that have been accounted for using the consolidation method of accounting, noncontrolling interest represents the allocation of earnings to our joint venture partners who either have a minority-ownership interest in the joint venture or are not at risk for the majority of losses of the joint venture.\nOur 2014 income tax provision from continuing operations was $103.5 million compared to $82.3 million for 2013. The actual income tax rates on income from continuing operations before income taxes, less amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, were 37.4% and 35.9%, respectively. The increase in the 2014 income tax provision compared to 2013 was primarily due to the effect of increased income before income taxes and the 2013 reversal of previously unrecognized income tax benefits.\nDiscontinued operations\nDue to a historical pattern of losses in the construction operations of our United Kingdom segment and our negative assessment of construction market conditions in the United Kingdom for the foreseeable future, we announced during the quarter ended June 30, 2013 our decision to withdraw from the construction market in the United Kingdom. During the third quarter of 2014, we ceased construction operations in the United Kingdom. The results of the construction operations of our United Kingdom segment for all periods are presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements as discontinued operations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table presents net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>266,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>246,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(59,808\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(21,668\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(483,422\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(149,473\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(229,950\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>167,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,610\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,796\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>832\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur consolidated cash balance increased by approximately $54.8 million from $432.1 million at December 31, 2014 to $486.8 million at December 31, 2015. Net cash provided by operating activities for 2015 was $266.7 million compared to $246.7 million of net cash provided by operating activities for 2014. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to: (a) a $70.7 million increase in net over-billings related to the timing of customer billings and payments, (b) a $50.6 million increase in accounts payable and (c) a $40.5 million increase in other working capital changes, partially offset by a $142.7 million increase in accounts receivable. Net cash used in investing activities was $59.8 million for 2015 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $21.7 million for 2014. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to payments to acquire businesses in 2015. Net cash used in financing activities for 2015 decreased by approximately $80.5 million compared to 2014. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to a decrease in funds used for the repurchase of common stock. Cash flows from discontinued operations were immaterial and are not expected to significantly affect future liquidity.\nOur consolidated cash balance decreased by approximately $7.8 million from $439.8 million at December 31, 2013 to $432.1 million at December 31, 2014. Net cash provided by operating activities for 2014 was $246.7 million compared to $150.1 million of net cash provided by operating activities for 2013. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to: (a) a $46.1 million increase in net income, (b) a $30.6 million decrease in accounts receivable and (c) a $16.0 million reduction in income taxes paid, partially offset by a $12.2 million decrease in accounts payable. Net cash used in investing activities was $21.7 million for 2014 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $483.4 million for 2013. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the lack of acquisitions in 2014. Net cash used in financing activities for 2014 increased by approximately $397.0 million compared to 2013. The increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an\nincrease in funds used for the repurchase of common stock of $175.9 million, the repayment of long-term debt, and the payment of regular quarterly dividends to stockholders, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nThe following is a summary of material contractual obligations and other commercial commitments (in millions):\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less\nthan\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term Loan (including interest currently at 1.67%) (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>329.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>306.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>239.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Open purchase obligations (2)\n</td> <td>1,021.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>802.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>199.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term obligations, including current portion (3)\n</td> <td>363.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>310.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liabilities related to uncertain income tax positions\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,963.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>931.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>903.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount of Commitment Expirations by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Commercial Commitments\n</td> <td>Total\nAmounts\nCommitted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less\nthan\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Letters of credit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>On November 25, 2013, we entered into a a $750.0 million revolving credit facility (the 2013 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) and a $350.0 million term loan (the \"Term Loan\"), (collectively referred to as the \"2013 Credit Agreement\").

We provide funding to our post retirement plans based on at least the minimum funding required by applicable regulations. In determining the minimum required funding, we utilize current actuarial assumptions and exchange rates to forecast estimates of amounts that may be payable for up to five years in the future. In our judgment, minimum funding estimates beyond a five year time horizon cannot be reliably estimated, and therefore, have not been included in the table.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Until November 25, 2013, we had a revolving credit agreement (the 2011 Credit Agreement\u201d) as amended, which provided for a revolving credit facility of $750.0 million. The 2011 Credit Agreement was effective November 21, 2011. Effective November 25, 2013, we amended and restated the 2011 Credit Agreement to provide for a $750.0 million revolving credit facility (the 2013 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) and a $350.0 million term loan (the Term Loan\u201d) (collectively referred to as the 2013 Credit Agreement) expiring November 25, 2018. The proceeds of the Term Loan were used to repay amounts drawn under the 2011 Credit Agreement. We may increase the 2013 Revolving Credit Facility to $1.05 billion if additional lenders are identified and/or existing lenders are willing to increase their current commitments. We may allocate up to $250.0 million of available capacity under the 2013 Revolving Credit Facility to letters of credit for our account or for the account of our subsidiaries. The 2013 Revolving Credit Agreement is guaranteed by most of our direct and indirect subsidiaries and is secured by substantially all of our assets and most of the assets of most of our subsidiaries. The 2013 Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan contain various covenants providing for, among other things, maintenance of certain financial ratios and certain limitations on payment of dividends, common stock repurchases, investments, acquisitions, indebtedness and capital expenditures. We were in compliance with all such covenants as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. A commitment fee is payable on the average daily unused amount under the 2013 Revolving Credit Facility, which ranges from 0.20% to 0.30%, based on certain financial tests. The fee was 0.20% of the unused amount as of December 31, 2015. Borrowings under the 2013 Revolving Credit Facility and the\nTerm Loan bear interest at (1) a rate which is the prime commercial lending rate announced by Bank of Montreal from time to time (3.50% at December 31, 2015) plus 0.25% to 0.75%, based on certain financial tests or (2) United States dollar LIBOR (0.42% at December 31, 2015) plus 1.25% to 1.75%, based on certain financial tests. The interest rate in effect at December 31, 2015 was 1.67%. Fees for letters of credit issued under the 2013 Revolving Credit Facility range from 1.25% to 1.75% of the respective face amounts of outstanding letters of credit and are charged based on certain financial tests. We capitalized approximately $3.0 million of debt issuance costs associated with the 2013 Credit Agreement. This amount is being amortized over the life of the agreement and is included as part of interest expense. We are required to make principal payments on the Term Loan in installments on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year, commencing with the calendar quarter ended March 31, 2014, in the amount of $4.4 million, with a final payment of all unpaid principal and interest due and payable on November 25, 2018. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the balance on the Term Loan was $315.0 million and $332.5 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had approximately $99.0 million and $95.5 million of letters of credit outstanding, respectively. There were no borrowings outstanding under the 2013 Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nThe terms of our construction contracts frequently require that we obtain from surety companies ( Surety Companies\u201d) and provide to our customers payment and performance bonds ( Surety Bonds\u201d) as a condition to the award of such contracts. The Surety Bonds secure our payment and performance obligations under such contracts, and we have agreed to indemnify the Surety Companies for amounts, if any, paid by them in respect of Surety Bonds issued on our behalf. In addition, at the request of labor unions representing certain of our employees, Surety Bonds are sometimes provided to secure obligations for wages and benefits payable to or for such employees. Public sector contracts require Surety Bonds more frequently than private sector contracts, and accordingly, our bonding requirements typically increase as the amount of public sector work increases. As of December 31, 2015, based on our percentage-of-completion of our projects covered by Surety Bonds, our aggregate estimated exposure, assuming defaults on all our then existing contractual obligations, was approximately $1.2 billion, which represents approximately 32% of our total backlog. The Surety Bonds are issued by Surety Companies in return for premiums, which vary depending on the size and type of bond.\nFrom time to time, we discuss with our current and other Surety Bond providers the amounts of Surety Bonds that may be available to us based on our financial strength and the absence of any default by us on any Surety Bond issued on our behalf and believe those amounts are currently adequate for our needs. However, if we experience changes in our bonding relationships or if there are adverse changes in the surety industry, we may seek to satisfy certain customer requests for Surety Bonds by posting other forms of collateral in lieu of Surety Bonds such as letters of credit, parent company guarantees or cash, seeking to convince customers to forego the requirement for Surety Bonds, by increasing our activities in our business segments that rarely require Surety Bonds such as our building and industrial services segments, and/or by refraining from bidding for certain projects that require Surety Bonds. There can be no assurance that we would be able to effectuate alternatives to providing Surety Bonds to our customers or to obtain, on favorable terms, sufficient additional work that does not require Surety Bonds. Accordingly, if we were to experience a reduction in the availability of Surety Bonds, we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we, at times, guarantee obligations of our subsidiaries under certain contracts. Generally, we are liable under such an arrangement only if our subsidiary fails to perform its obligations under the contract. Historically, we have not incurred any substantial liabilities as a consequence of these guarantees.\nWe do not have any other material financial guarantees or off-balance sheet arrangements other than those disclosed herein.\nWe are a party to lawsuits and other proceedings in which other parties seek to recover from us amounts ranging from a few thousand dollars to over $10.0 million. We do not believe that any such matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nOn September 26, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $100.0 million of our outstanding common stock. On December 5, 2013, October 23, 2014 and October 28, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $100.0 million, $250.0 million and $200.0 million of our outstanding common stock, respectively. During 2015, we repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares of our common stock for approximately $112.3 million. Since the inception of these repurchase programs through December 31, 2015, we have repurchased 9.9 million shares of our common stock for approximately $395.9 million. As of December 31, 2015, there remained authorization for us to repurchase approximately $254.1 million of our shares. The repurchase programs do not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may be suspended, recommenced or discontinued at any time or from time to time without prior notice. Repurchases may be made from time to time to the extent permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements, including provisions in our credit agreement placing limitations on such repurchases. The repurchase programs have been and will be funded from our operations.\nWe have paid quarterly dividends since October 25, 2011. We expect that quarterly dividends will be paid in the foreseeable future. Prior to October 25, 2011, no cash dividends had been paid on the Company's common stock. We currently pay a regular\nquarterly dividend of $0.08 per share. Our 2013 Credit Agreement places limitations on the payment of dividends on our common stock. However, we do not believe that the terms of such agreement currently materially limit our ability to pay a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share for the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends has been and will be funded from our operations.\nOur primary source of liquidity has been, and is expected to continue to be, cash generated by operating activities. We also maintain our 2013 Revolving Credit Facility that may be utilized, among other things, to meet short-term liquidity needs in the event cash generated by operating activities is insufficient or to enable us to seize opportunities to participate in joint ventures or to make acquisitions that may require access to cash on short notice or for any other reason. Negative macroeconomic trends may have an adverse effect on liquidity. During economic downturns, there have been typically fewer small discretionary projects from the private sector, and our competitors have aggressively bid larger long-term infrastructure and public sector contracts. Short-term liquidity is also impacted by the type and length of construction contracts in place and large turnaround activities in our United States industrial services segment that are billed in arrears pursuant to contractual terms that are standard within this industry. Performance of long duration contracts typically requires greater amounts of working capital. While we strive to maintain a net over-billed position with our customers, there can be no assurance that a net over-billed position can be maintained. Our net over-billings, defined as the balance sheet accounts Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts\u201d less Cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts\u201d, were $311.5 million and $265.4 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nLong-term liquidity requirements can be expected to be met initially through cash generated from operating activities and our 2013 Revolving Credit Facility. Based upon our current credit ratings and financial position, we can reasonably expect to be able to incur long-term debt to fund acquisitions. Over the long term, our primary revenue risk factor continues to be the level of demand for non-residential construction services and for building and industrial services, which is influenced by macroeconomic trends including interest rates and governmental economic policy. In addition, our ability to perform work is critical to meeting long-term liquidity requirements.\nWe believe that our current cash balances and our borrowing capacity available under our 2013 Revolving Credit Facility or other forms of financing available to us through borrowings, combined with cash expected to be generated from operations, will be sufficient to provide our short-term and foreseeable long-term liquidity and meet our expected capital expenditure requirements.\nCertain Insurance Matters\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we utilized approximately $97.8 million and $94.6 million, respectively, of letters of credit obtained under our 2013 Revolving Credit Facility as collateral for insurance obligations.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nWe review new accounting standards to determine the expected impact, if any, that the adoption of such standards will have on our financial position and/or results of operations. See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information regarding new accounting standards, including the anticipated dates of adoption and the effects on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are based on the application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. We believe that some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of accounting policies that affect our financial condition and results of operations are the impact of changes in the estimates and judgments pertaining to: (a) revenue recognition from (i) long-term construction contracts for which the percentage-of-completion method of accounting is used and (ii) services contracts; (b) collectibility or valuation of accounts receivable; (c) insurance liabilities; (d) income taxes; and (e) goodwill and identifiable intangible assets.\nRevenue Recognition from Long-term Construction Contracts and Services Contracts\nWe believe our most critical accounting policy is revenue recognition from long-term construction contracts for which we use the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Percentage-of-completion accounting is the prescribed method of accounting for long-term contracts in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 605-35, Revenue Recognition-Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts\u201d, and, accordingly, is the method used for revenue recognition within our industry. Percentage-of-completion is measured principally by the percentage of costs incurred to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for such contract at completion. Certain of our electrical contracting business units measure percentage-of-completion by the percentage of labor costs incurred to date for each contract to the estimated total labor costs for such contract.\nPre-contract costs from our construction projects are generally expensed as incurred. Application of percentage-of-completion accounting results in the recognition of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets arise when revenues have been recognized but the amounts cannot be billed under the terms of contracts. Such amounts are recoverable from customers based upon various measures of performance, including achievement of certain milestones, completion of specified units or completion of a contract.\nCosts and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts also include amounts we seek or will seek to collect from customers or others for errors or changes in contract specifications or design, contract change orders in dispute or unapproved as to both scope and price or other customer-related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs (claims and unapproved change orders). Such amounts are recorded at estimated net realizable value and take into account factors that may affect our ability to bill and ultimately collect unbilled revenues. The profit associated with claim amounts is not recognized until the claim has been settled and payment has been received. During 2015, we recognized revenues of $12.1 million as a result of the settlement of a claim within our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment, which represents the recovery of cost on a project in which we incurred significant losses in a prior year. There were no significant settlements or payment of claims in 2014. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts included unbilled revenues for unapproved change orders of approximately $18.9 million and $18.8 million, respectively, and claims of approximately $0.9 million and $3.0 million, respectively. In addition, accounts receivable as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 included claims of approximately $0.3 million and $2.3 million, respectively. There are contractually billed amounts and retention related to contracts with unapproved change orders and claims of approximately $52.0 million and $54.0 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. For contracts in claim status, contractually billed amounts will generally not be paid by the customer to us until final resolution of related claims. Due to uncertainties inherent in estimates employed in applying percentage-of-completion accounting, estimates may be revised as project work progresses. Application of percentage-of-completion accounting requires that the impact of revised estimates be reported prospectively in the consolidated financial statements. In addition to revenue recognition for long-term construction contracts, we recognize revenues from the performance of services for maintenance, repair and retrofit work consistent with the performance of the services, which are generally on a pro-rata basis over the life of the contractual arrangement. Expenses related to all services arrangements are recognized as incurred. Revenues related to the engineering, manufacturing and repairing of shell and tube heat exchangers are recognized when the product is shipped and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Costs related to this work are included in inventory until the product is shipped. Provisions for the entirety of estimated losses on contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. There were no significant losses recognized in 2015 and 2014.\nAccounts Receivable\nWe are required to estimate the collectibility of accounts receivable. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the likelihood of realization of receivables. Relevant assessment factors include the creditworthiness of the customer, our prior collection history with the customer and related aging of past due balances. The provision for doubtful accounts during 2015, 2014 and 2013 amounted to approximately $2.9 million, $2.9 million and $3.5 million, respectively. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, our accounts receivable of $1,359.9 million and $1,234.2 million, respectively, included allowances for doubtful accounts of $11.2 million and $10.4 million, respectively. The increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts was primarily due to an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts, partially offset by the write-off of previously reserved accounts receivable. Specific accounts receivable are evaluated when we believe a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its financial condition or its credit ratings. The allowance for doubtful accounts requirements are based on the best facts available and are re-evaluated and adjusted on a regular basis as additional information is received.\nInsurance Liabilities\nWe have loss payment deductibles for certain workers' compensation, automobile liability, general liability and property claims, have self-insured retentions for certain other casualty claims and are self-insured for employee-related health care claims. Losses are recorded based upon estimates of our liability for claims incurred and for claims incurred but not reported. The liabilities are derived from known facts, historical trends and industry averages utilizing the assistance of an actuary to determine the best estimate for the majority of these obligations. We believe the liabilities recognized on our balance sheets for these obligations are adequate. However, such obligations are difficult to assess and estimate due to numerous factors, including severity of injury, determination of liability in proportion to other parties, timely reporting of occurrences and effectiveness of safety and risk management programs. Therefore, if our actual experience differs from the assumptions and estimates used for recording the liabilities, adjustments may be required and will be recorded in the period that the experience becomes known. Our estimated insurance liabilities for workers' compensation, automobile liability, general liability and property claims increased by $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to higher revenues and an increase in estimated losses as a result of unfavorable claims experience. If our estimated insurance liabilities for workers'\ncompensation, automobile liability, general liability and property claims were to increase by 10%, it would have resulted in $14.4 million of additional expense for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nWe had net deferred income tax liabilities at December 31, 2015 and 2014 of $120.6 million and $127.8 million, respectively, primarily resulting from differences between the carrying value and income tax basis of certain identifiable intangible assets and depreciable fixed assets, which will impact our taxable income in future periods. Included within these net deferred income tax liabilities are $121.4 million and $114.2 million of deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. A valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred income tax asset will not be realized. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the total valuation allowance on deferred income tax assets, related to state net operating carryforwards, was approximately $0.8 million and $2.0 million, respectively. We have determined that as of December 31, 2015, a valuation allowance was not required on any of the remaining deferred tax assets because of significant deferred tax liabilities, exclusive of the deferred tax liabilities related to indefinite-lived intangible assets, and projected future taxable income.\nGoodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $843.2 million and $472.8 million, respectively, of goodwill and net identifiable intangible assets (primarily consisting of our contract backlog, developed technology/vendor network, customer relationships, non-competition agreements and trade names), primarily arising out of the acquisition of companies. As of December 31, 2014, goodwill and net identifiable intangible assets were $834.1 million and $502.1 million, respectively. The changes to goodwill since December 31, 2014 were related to the acquisition of three companies in 2015. The determination of related estimated useful lives for identifiable intangible assets and whether those assets are impaired involves significant judgments based upon short and long-term projections of future performance. These forecasts reflect assumptions regarding the ability to successfully integrate acquired companies, as well as macroeconomic conditions. ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other\u201d ( ASC 350\u201d) requires goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives not be amortized, but instead tested at least annually for impairment (which we test each October 1, absent any impairment indicators), and be written down if impaired. ASC 350 requires that goodwill be allocated to its respective reporting unit and that identifiable intangible assets with finite lives be amortized over their useful lives.\nWe test for impairment of our goodwill at the reporting unit level. Our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in Note 17, Segment Information\u201d, of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. In assessing whether our goodwill is impaired, we utilize the two-step process as prescribed by ASC 350. The first step of this test compares the fair value of the reporting unit, determined based upon discounted estimated future cash flows, to the carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, no further analysis is required and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and step two of the goodwill impairment test would need to be performed to measure the amount of an impairment loss, if any. In the second step, the impairment is computed by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill, an impairment loss in the amount of the excess is recognized and charged to operations. The weighted average cost of capital used in our annual testing for impairment as of October 1, 2015 was 11.1%, 11.1% and 11.0% for our domestic construction segments, our United States building services segment and our United States industrial services segment, respectively. The perpetual growth rate used for our annual testing was 2.7% for all of our domestic segments. Unfavorable changes in these key assumptions may affect future testing results and cause us to fail step one of the goodwill impairment testing process. For example, keeping all other assumptions constant, a 50 basis point increase in the weighted average costs of capital would cause the estimated fair value of our United Stated industrial services segment to approach its carrying value. A 50 basis point increase in the weighted average costs of capital would not significantly reduce the excess of the estimated fair value compared to the carrying value for any of our other domestic segments. In addition, keeping all other assumptions constant, a 50 basis point reduction in the perpetual growth rate would not significantly reduce the excess of the estimated fair value compared to the carrying value for any of our domestic segments. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, no impairment of our goodwill was recognized.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $843.2 million of goodwill on our balance sheet and, of this amount, approximately 45.6% relates to our United States industrial services segment, approximately 27.1% relates to our United States building services segment, approximately 26.8% relates to our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment and approximately 0.5% relates to our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment. As of the date of our latest impairment test, the carrying values of our United States industrial services, United States building services, United States mechanical construction and facilities services and United States electrical construction and facilities services segments were approximately $725.5 million, $445.1 million, $249.5 million and $62.9 million, respectively. The fair values of our United States industrial services, United States building services, United States mechanical construction and facilities services and United States electrical construction\nand facilities services segments exceeded their carrying values by approximately $52.5 million, $291.2 million, $773.2 million and $661.7 million, respectively.\nWe also test for the impairment of trade names that are not subject to amortization by calculating the fair value of such trade names using the relief from royalty payments\u201d methodology. This approach involves two steps: (a) estimating reasonable royalty rates for each trade name and (b) applying these royalty rates to a net revenue stream and discounting the resulting cash flows to determine fair value. This fair value is then compared with the carrying value of each trade name. If the carrying amount of the trade name is greater than the implied fair value of the trade name, an impairment in the amount of the excess is recognized and charged to operations. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2013, no impairment of our trade names was recognized. The annual impairment review of our trade names for the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted in a $1.5 million non-cash impairment charge as a result of a change in the fair value of subsidiary trade names associated with certain prior acquisitions reported within our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment and our United States building services segment.\nIn addition, we review for the impairment of other identifiable intangible assets that are being amortized whenever facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be fully recoverable. This test compares their carrying values to the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets. If the assets are impaired, the assets are written down to their fair values, generally determined based on their future discounted cash flows. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, no impairment of our other identifiable intangible assets was recognized.\nWe have certain businesses, particularly within our United States industrial services segment, whose results are highly impacted by the demand for some of our offerings within the industrial and oil and gas markets. Future performance of this segment, along with a continued evaluation of the conditions of its end user markets, will be important to ongoing impairment assessments. Should this segment's actual results suffer a decline or expected future results be revised downward, the risk of goodwill impairment or impairment of other identifiable intangible assets would increase.\nOur development of the present value of future cash flow projections used in impairment testing is based upon assumptions and estimates by management from a review of our operating results, business plans, anticipated growth rates and margins and weighted average cost of capital, among others. Those assumptions and estimates can change in future periods, and other factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management, such as interest rates. There can be no assurances that estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our goodwill and identifiable intangible asset impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. If our assumptions regarding future business performance or anticipated growth rates and/or margins are not achieved, or there is a rise in interest rates, we may be required to record goodwill and/or identifiable intangible asset impairment charges in future periods. It is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or, if it does, whether such a charge would be material.",

    "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe are one of the largest electrical and mechanical construction and facilities services firms in the United States. In addition, we provide a number of building services and industrial services. Our services are provided to a broad range of commercial, industrial, utility and institutional customers through approximately 70 operating subsidiaries and joint venture entities. Our offices are located in the United States and the United Kingdom.\nOperating Segments\nWe have the following reportable segments which provide services associated with the design, integration, installation, start-up, operation and maintenance of various systems: (a) United States electrical construction and facilities services (involving systems for electrical power transmission and distribution; premises electrical and lighting systems; low-voltage systems, such as fire alarm, security and process control; voice and data communication; roadway and transit lighting; and fiber optic lines); (b) United States mechanical construction and facilities services (involving systems for heating, ventilation, air conditioning, refrigeration and clean-room process ventilation; fire protection; plumbing, process and high-purity piping; controls and filtration; water and wastewater treatment; central plant heating and cooling; cranes and rigging; millwrighting; and steel fabrication, erection and welding); (c) United States building services; (d) United States industrial services; and (e) United Kingdom building services. The United States building services\u201d and United Kingdom building services\u201d segments principally consist of those operations which provide a portfolio of services needed to support the operation and maintenance of customers' facilities, including commercial and government site-based operations and maintenance; facility maintenance and services, including reception, security and catering services; outage services to utilities and industrial plants; military base operations support services; mobile maintenance and services; floor care and janitorial services; landscaping, lot sweeping and snow removal; facilities management; vendor management; call center services; installation and support for building systems; program development, management and maintenance for energy systems; technical consulting and diagnostic services; infrastructure and building projects for federal, state and local governmental agencies and bodies; and small modification and retrofit projects, which services are not generally related to customers' construction programs. The segment United States industrial services\u201d principally consists of those operations which provide industrial maintenance and services, including those for refineries and petrochemical plants, including on-site repairs, maintenance and service of heat exchangers, towers, vessels and piping; design, manufacturing, repair and hydro blast cleaning of shell and tube heat exchangers and related equipment; refinery turnaround planning and engineering services; specialty welding services; overhaul and maintenance of critical process units in refineries and petrochemical plants; and specialty technical services for refineries and petrochemical plants.\nWe acquired three companies in 2015, each for an immaterial amount. Two of the companies acquired primarily provide mechanical construction services, and their results of operations have been included in our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment. The results of operations for the other company acquired have been included in our United States building services segment.\nWe completed the acquisition of RepconStrickland, Inc. ( RSI\u201d) during 2013, and its results have been included in our United States industrial services segment since its acquisition. In addition, we completed two other acquisitions during 2013, and their results have been included in our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment. These acquired businesses expanded our service capabilities into new technical areas.\n2015 versus 2014\nOverview\nThe following table presents selected financial data for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands, except percentages and per share data):\n\nThe results of our operations for 2015 set new Company records in terms of revenues and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. Our 2015 results included increased revenues from all of our reportable segments. In addition, excluding the impact of the $11.7 million gain on the sale of a building and the $1.5 million impairment loss on identifiable intangible assets in 2014, our operating income (operating income as a percentage of revenues) increased in 2015 compared to 2014. Our overall 2015 operating income and operating margin were favorably impacted by improved operating performance within: (a) our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment, partially attributable to revenues of $12.1 million recognized as a result of the settlement of a claim on an institutional project located in the southeastern United States, and (b) our United States building services segment, as a result of increased profitability within this segment's mobile mechanical and commercial site-based services operations.\nOur operating results for 2015 were negatively impacted by: (a) our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment, (b) our United States industrial services segment and (c) our United Kingdom building services segment. Decreases in both operating income and operating margin within our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment were partially attributable to approximately $10.1 million of losses incurred on several transportation projects. Decreases in both operating income and operating margin within our United States industrial services segment were primarily due to: (a) the negative impact of a nationwide strike by union employees of certain major oil refineries in the first half of 2015, which led to both deferrals and losses of certain turnaround projects that generate relatively high gross profit margins, and (b) a decrease in the billing rates and related gross profit margins within our industrial shop services operations due to competitive market conditions resulting from decreased demand for new heat exchangers as a result of volatility in crude oil prices that led to a curtailment in capital spending.\nTwo of the companies acquired in 2015, which are reported in our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment, generated incremental revenues of $12.5 million and less than $0.1 million of operating income, net of $0.3 million of amortization expense associated with identifiable intangible assets. The results of operations for the third company acquired in 2015, which are reported in our United States building services segment, were de minimis.\nDiscussion and Analysis of Results of Operations\nRevenues\nAs described in more detail below, revenues for 2015 were $6.7 billion compared to $6.4 billion for 2014. The increase in revenues for 2015 was primarily attributable to: (a) increased revenues from both of our domestic construction segments, (b) increased demand for our industrial field services within our United States industrial services segment and (c) increased revenues from our mobile mechanical services operations within our United States building services segment. Revenues increased within our United States industrial services segment despite a nationwide strike by union employees of certain major oil refineries that negatively impacted the first half of 2015.\nThe following table presents our revenues for each of our operating segments and the approximate percentages that each segment's revenues were of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands, except for percentages):\n\nRevenues of our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment were $1,367.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to revenues of $1,312.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in revenues from commercial, healthcare and manufacturing construction projects, partially offset by a decrease in revenues from institutional construction projects.\nOur United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $2,312.8 million, a $111.6 million increase compared to revenues of $2,201.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in revenues from commercial and institutional construction projects, partially offset by a decline in revenues from manufacturing, water and wastewater and transportation construction projects. The results for the year ended December 31, 2015 included $12.5 million of revenues generated by companies acquired in 2015.\nRevenues of our United States building services segment were $1,739.3 million and $1,721.3 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in revenues was primarily attributable to increased revenues from: (a) our mobile mechanical services operations, in part due to significant activity in the California and New England regions and increased project and retrofit activities, and (b) our energy services operations. These increases were partially offset by decreased revenues from: (a) our government site-based services operations as a result of the completion in 2014 of two large long-term site-based joint venture projects not renewed pursuant to rebid, (b) our commercial site-based services operations as a result of: (i) a decline in add-on project activities, (ii) a decrease in revenues from its snow removal activities, as a result of less snowfall in geographical areas in which many of our contracts are based on a per snow event basis, and (iii) a decrease in revenues from supplier management contracts.\nRevenues of our United States industrial services segment for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $82.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in revenues was primarily due to large capital and maintenance project activity within our industrial field services operations. Revenues increased within this segment despite a nationwide strike by union employees of certain major oil refineries that negatively impacted the first half of 2015.\nOur United Kingdom building services segment revenues were $377.5 million in 2015 compared to $350.4 million in 2014. The increase in revenues was due to an increase in activity in the commercial market attributable to several new contract awards as well as increased work under existing contracts. The increase in revenues was partially offset by a decrease of $29.2 million relating to the effect of unfavorable exchange rates for the British pound versus the United States dollar.\nBacklog\nThe following table presents our operating segment backlog from unrelated entities and their respective percentages of total backlog (in thousands, except for percentages):\n\nOur backlog at December 31, 2015 was $3.77 billion compared to $3.63 billion at December 31, 2014. This increase in backlog was primarily attributable to an increase in backlog from our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment and our United States building services segment, partially offset by lower backlog from our other reportable segments. Backlog increases with awards of new contracts and decreases as we perform work on existing contracts. Backlog is not a term recognized under United States generally accepted accounting principles; however, it is a common measurement used in our industry. We include a project within our backlog at such time as a contract is awarded and agreement on contract terms has been reached. Backlog includes unrecognized revenues to be realized from uncompleted construction contracts plus unrecognized revenues expected to be realized over the remaining term of services contracts. However, we do not include in backlog contracts for which we are paid on a time and material basis and a fixed amount cannot be determined, and if the remaining term of a services contract exceeds 12 months, the unrecognized revenues attributable to such contract included in backlog are limited to only the next 12 months of revenues provided for in the contract award. Our backlog also includes amounts related to services contracts for which a fixed price contract value is not assigned when a reasonable estimate of total revenues can be made from budgeted amounts agreed to with our customer. Our backlog is comprised of: (a) original contract amounts, (b) change orders for which we have received written confirmations from our customers, (c) pending change orders for which we expect to receive confirmations in the ordinary course of business and (d) claim amounts that we have made against customers for which we have determined we have a legal basis under existing contractual arrangements and as to which we consider recovery to be probable. Such claim amounts were immaterial for all periods presented. Our backlog does not include anticipated revenues from unconsolidated joint ventures or variable interest entities and anticipated revenues from pass-through costs on contracts for which we are acting in the capacity of an agent and which are reported on the net basis. We believe our backlog is firm, although many contracts are subject to cancellation at the election of our customers. Historically, cancellations have not had a material adverse effect on us.\nCost of sales and Gross profit\nThe following table presents cost of sales, gross profit (revenues less cost of sales), and gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of revenues) for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands, except for percentages):\n\nOur gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $944.5 million, a $37.2 million increase compared to the gross profit of $907.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our gross profit margin was 14.1% for both 2015 and 2014. Favorable variances in both gross profit and gross profit margin within: (a) our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment, which included revenues of $12.1 million recognized as a result of the settlement of a claim on an institutional project located in the southeastern United States, and (b) our United States building services segment were partially offset by decreases in gross profit and gross profit margin within our United Kingdom building services and our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment. Gross profit within our United States industrial services segment slightly increased; however, gross margin within this segment declined due to a decrease in the billing rates and related gross profit margins within our industrial shop services operations due to competitive market conditions resulting from decreased demand for new heat exchangers as a result of volatility in crude oil prices that led to a curtailment in capital spending.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nThe following table presents selling, general and administrative expenses and SG&A margin (selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues) for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands, except for percentages):\n\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $656.6 million, a $30.1 million increase compared to selling, general and administrative expenses of $626.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 9.8% for both 2015 and 2014. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was due to higher employee related costs such as incentive compensation, salaries and medical insurance costs, as well as certain other costs including computer hardware and software expenses, partially offset by a decrease in legal costs. Increased incentive compensation was principally due to higher annual operating results within certain operations than in 2014, which resulted in increased accruals for their incentive compensation plans. The increase in salaries was attributable to an increase in headcount, commensurate with an increase in revenues, as well as cost of living adjustments and merit pay increases.\nRestructuring expenses\nRestructuring expenses were $0.8 million and $1.2 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The 2015 restructuring expenses included $0.9 million of employee severance obligations and the reversal of $0.1 million relating to the termination of leased facilities. The 2014 restructuring expenses included $0.6 million of employee severance obligations and $0.6 million relating to the termination of leased facilities. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the balance of restructuring related obligations yet to be paid was $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively. The majority of obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2014 was paid during 2015. The obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2015 will be paid during the first half of 2016.\nGain on sale of building\nOn July 22, 2014, we sold a building and land owned by one of our subsidiaries reported in the United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment. We recognized a gain of approximately $11.7 million on this transaction in the third quarter of 2014, which has been classified as a Gain on sale of building\u201d in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nImpairment loss on goodwill and identifiable intangible assets\nNo impairment of our identifiable intangible assets was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2015. In conjunction with our 2014 annual impairment test on October 1, we recognized a $1.5 million non-cash impairment charge related to subsidiary trade names within the United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment and the United States building services segment. The 2014 impairment primarily resulted from lower forecasted revenues from two companies within these segments. Additionally, no impairment of our goodwill was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nOperating income (loss)\nThe following table presents by segment our operating income (loss) and each segment's operating income (loss) as a percentage of such segment's revenues from unrelated entities for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands, except for percentages):\n\nAs described in more detail below, we had operating income of $287.1 million for 2015 compared to operating income of $289.9 million for 2014. Operating margin was 4.3% and 4.5% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. Included within operating income for 2014 was an $11.7 million gain on the sale of a building, resulting in a 0.2% impact on our consolidated operating margin for 2014.\nOperating income of our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $82.2 million compared to operating income of $90.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was due to a decrease in gross profit from transportation, institutional and manufacturing construction projects and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses due to higher employee related costs such as incentive compensation and salaries. The decrease in gross profit from transportation construction projects included approximately $10.1 million of losses incurred on several projects due to productivity issues and delays. The increase in incentive compensation was principally due to higher annual operating results within certain operations than in 2014, which resulted in increased accruals for certain of our incentive compensation plans. The decrease in operating income was partially offset by an increase in gross profit from: (a) commercial construction projects, partially due to profits recognized on contracts in the Mid-Atlantic region and (b) healthcare construction projects. The decrease in operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 was attributable to a decrease in gross profit margin, partially as a result of losses recorded on transportation projects, as well as an increase in the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to revenues resulting from an increase in incentive compensation due to higher annual operating results within certain operations than in 2014.\nOur United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $138.7 million, a $24.3 million increase compared to operating income of $114.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Operating income was favorably impacted by an increase in gross profit from institutional, commercial and manufacturing construction projects, partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. The results for 2015 included revenues of $12.1 million recognized as a result of the settlement of a claim on an institutional project located in the southeastern United States. The results for 2014 included the receipt of $3.0 million from former shareholders of a company we had acquired as a result of the settlement of a claim by us under the acquisition agreement; this payment has been recorded as a reduction of \"Cost of sales\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of an increase in incentive compensation due to higher annual operating results than in 2014, which resulted in increased accruals for certain of our incentive compensation plans. Companies acquired in 2015 generated operating income of less than $0.1 million, net of amortization expense of $0.3 million attributable to identifiable intangible assets. The increase in operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 was attributable to an increase in gross profit margin.\nOperating income of our United States building services segment was $70.5 million and $65.9 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to improved performance from: (a) our mobile mechanical services operations, partially due to increased profitability in projects, retrofits, repair services work and service contracts, and (b) our commercial site-based services operations, partially due to a reduction in legal costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in operating income from: (a) our energy services operations as, in 2014, we benefited from the successful completion of a large project and (b) our government site-based services operations as a result of the completion in 2014 of two large long-term site-based joint venture projects not renewed pursuant to rebid. The results for the year ended December 31, 2015 included income of approximately $2.7 million, net of associated legal costs, upon the favorable settlement of a claim by us against the former owner of a company we had previously acquired within our commercial site-based services operations. The increase in operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 was attributable to an increase in gross profit margin.\nOperating income of our United States industrial services segment for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $6.7 million compared to operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to: (a) a decrease in gross profit from our industrial shop services operations due to: (i) a decrease in the billing rates and related gross profit margins due to competitive market conditions resulting from decreased demand for new heat exchangers as a result of volatility in crude oil prices that led to a curtailment in capital spending and (ii) the mix of work, which included fewer repair projects than in 2014, that generate relatively high gross profit margins, (b) the negative impact of a nationwide strike by union employees of certain major oil refineries in the first half of 2015, which led to both deferrals and losses of certain turnaround projects that generate relatively high gross profit margins, and (c) an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses due to higher employee related costs such as salaries and employee benefits, partially as a result of increased headcount. The decrease in operating income was partially offset by large capital and maintenance project activity within our industrial field services operations. The decrease in operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 was attributable to a decrease in gross profit margin.\nOur United Kingdom building services segment's operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $11.6 million compared to operating income of $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in operating income and operating margin was primarily attributable to the impact of $4.8 million of income recognized in the second quarter of 2014 as a result of a reduction in the estimate of certain accrued contract costs that were no longer expected to be incurred. The overall decrease in gross profit in this segment was partially offset by an increase in gross profit from both new contract awards and increased project activity within the commercial market. This segment recorded a decrease in operating income of $0.9 million relating to the effect of unfavorable exchange rates for the British pound versus the United States dollar.\nOur corporate administration operating loss was $71.6 million for 2015 compared to $68.6 million in 2014. The increase in expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to an increase in certain employment costs, such as incentive compensation and salaries, as well as certain other expenses including legal costs. The increase in incentive compensation was partially due to higher awards earned than in 2014, which resulted in increased accruals for certain of our incentive compensation plans.\nNon-operating items\nInterest expense was $8.9 million and $9.1 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in interest expense for 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to lower borrowings outstanding.\nInterest income was $0.7 million and $0.8 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in interest income was primarily related to lower invested cash balances.\nFor joint ventures that have been accounted for using the consolidation method of accounting, noncontrolling interest represents the allocation of earnings to our joint venture partners who either have a minority-ownership interest in the joint venture or are not at risk for the majority of losses of the joint venture.\nOur 2015 income tax provision from continuing operations was $106.3 million compared to $103.5 million for 2014. The actual income tax rates on income from continuing operations before income taxes, less amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, were 38.1% and 37.4%, respectively. The increase in the 2015 income tax provision compared to 2014 was predominantly due to certain increases in the state tax provision attributable to the mix of earnings and the effect of a change in the United Kingdom statutory tax rate on deferred tax assets.\nDiscontinued operations\nDue to a historical pattern of losses in the construction operations of our United Kingdom segment and our negative assessment of construction market conditions in the United Kingdom for the foreseeable future, we announced during the quarter ended June 30, 2013 our decision to withdraw from the construction market in the United Kingdom. During the third quarter of 2014, we ceased construction operations in the United Kingdom. The results of the construction operations of our United Kingdom segment for all periods are presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements as discontinued operations.\n2014 versus 2013\nOverview\nThe following table presents selected financial data for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands, except percentages and per share data):\n\nOverall revenues, operating income and operating margin (operating income as a percentage of revenues) increased in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase in revenues is primarily attributable to higher revenues from our United States industrial services segment and our United Kingdom building services segment, partially offset by a decline in revenues from our (a) United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment, (b) United States building services segment and (c) United States electrical construction and facilities services segment. Companies acquired in 2013, which are reported in our United States industrial segment and our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment, generated incremental revenues of $231.2 million in 2014. This amount reflects acquired companies' revenues in 2014 only for the time period these entities were not owned by EMCOR in the comparable 2013 period.\nThe increases in operating income were primarily attributable to improved operating performance within all of our reportable segments, except for our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment and our United States building services segment. Operating income margins increased within all of our reportable segments, except for our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment and our United States industrial services segment. In addition, our operating income and operating margin were favorably impacted by an $11.7 million gain on the sale of a building. Companies acquired in 2013, which are reported in our United States industrial segment and our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment, contributed $9.3 million to operating income, net of $8.2 million of amortization expense associated with identifiable intangible assets. These amounts reflect acquired companies' operating results in 2014 only for the time period these entities were not owned by EMCOR in the comparable 2013 period.\nDiscussion and Analysis of Results of Operations\nRevenues\nAs described in more detail below, revenues for 2014 were $6.4 billion compared to $6.3 billion for 2013. The increase in revenues for 2014 was primarily attributable to revenues of $231.2 million attributable to companies acquired in 2013 (which reflects acquired companies' revenues in 2014 only for the time period these entities were not owned by EMCOR in the comparable 2013 period) and higher revenues from our United States industrial services segment and our United Kingdom building services segment. This increase was partially offset by lower revenues from our other reportable segments.\nThe following table presents our revenues for each of our operating segments and the approximate percentages that each segment's revenues were of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands, except for percentages):\n\nRevenues of our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment were $1,312.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to revenues of $1,345.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenues from institutional and manufacturing construction projects, primarily in the southern California and Washington D.C. markets, as well as a decrease in revenues from water and wastewater construction projects. These decreases were partially offset by higher levels of work from transportation, commercial and healthcare projects.\nOur United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $2,201.2 million, a $128.6 million decrease compared to revenues of $2,329.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. This decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to a decline in revenues from manufacturing construction projects, partially as the result of the completion in 2013 of several large projects within this market sector, which were not replaced. This decrease was partially offset by: (a) an increase in revenues from commercial, hospitality and institutional construction projects and (b) incremental revenues of $19.2 million generated by companies acquired in 2013. This amount reflects acquired companies' revenues in 2014 only for the time period these entities were not owned by EMCOR in the comparable 2013 period.\nRevenues of our United States building services segment were $1,721.3 million and $1,795.0 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. This decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to decreased revenues from: (a) our commercial site-based services operations, as a result of a decline in revenues from supplier management contracts, including a large contract that was terminated by agreement of both parties, (b) our energy services operations, due to a reduction in large project work, and (c) our government site-based services operations, as a result of the completion of a large long-term site-based joint venture project located in the Pacific Northwest not renewed pursuant to rebid. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in revenues from our mobile mechanical service operations, primarily within the California and New England markets.\nRevenues of our United States industrial services segment for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $320.6 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. For the seven months ended July 31, 2014, RSI generated incremental revenues of $212.0 million. This amount reflects RSI's revenues in 2014 only for the time period RSI was not owned by EMCOR in the comparable 2013 period. The increase in revenues was also attributable to an increased demand for our industrial field services operations, partially offset by a decrease in revenues from our industrial shop services operations.\nOur United Kingdom building services segment revenues were $350.4 million in 2014 compared to $343.6 million in 2013. This increase in revenues was due to an increase of $16.9 million relating to the effect of favorable exchange rates for the British pound versus the United States dollar and increased activity within the commercial and healthcare markets, partially offset by decreased activity within the transportation and institutional markets.\nBacklog\nThe following table presents our operating segment backlog from unrelated entities and their respective percentages of total backlog (in thousands, except for percentages):\n\nOur backlog at December 31, 2014 was $3.63 billion compared to $3.34 billion at December 31, 2013. This increase in backlog was primarily attributable to an increase in contracts awarded for work in our: (a) United States electrical construction and facilities services segment and (b) United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment. Backlog increases with awards of new contracts and decreases as we perform work on existing contracts.\nCost of sales and Gross profit\nThe following table presents cost of sales, gross profit (revenues less cost of sales), and gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of revenues) for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands, except for percentages):\n\nOur gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $907.2 million, an $85.6 million increase compared to the gross profit of $821.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to improved profitability within all of our reportable segments, except for our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment. Gross profit in 2013 within our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment was negatively impacted by aggregate losses of approximately $24.5 million from one of our subsidiaries at two projects located in the southeastern United States. Companies acquired in 2013 included in our United States industrial services segment and our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment contributed an aggregate of $35.9 million to gross profit in 2014. This amount reflects acquired companies' gross profit in 2014 only for the time period these entities were not owned by EMCOR in the comparable 2013 period.\nOur gross profit margin was 14.1% and 13.0% for 2014 and 2013, respectively. Gross profit margin for 2014 increased within most of our reportable segments. Our consolidated gross profit margin benefited from an increase in revenues from our United States industrial services segment, which historically generates higher gross profit margins than our other reportable segments. Gross profit margin for 2013 was adversely impacted by the two significant project write-downs reported in our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment, resulting in a 0.4% impact on consolidated gross profit margin.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nThe following table presents selling, general and administrative expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands, except for percentages):\n\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $626.5 million, a $45.8 million increase compared to selling, general and administrative expenses of $580.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 9.8% and 9.2% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. This increase in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily resulted from: (a) $26.6 million of\nexpenses directly related to companies acquired in 2013, including amortization expense of $8.2 million attributable to identifiable intangible assets (which reflect acquired companies' expenses in 2014 only for the time period these entities were not owned by EMCOR in the comparable 2013 period), (b) higher employee related costs such as incentive compensation and employee benefits and (c) higher legal costs, including the unfavorable settlement of a legal matter. In addition, our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased due to higher revenues from our United States industrial services segment, which has a higher fixed cost structure than our other reportable segments. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013 included $6.1 million of transaction costs associated with the acquisition of RSI. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013 were reduced by $6.8 million of income attributable to the reversal of contingent consideration accruals relating to acquisitions made prior to 2013.\nRestructuring expenses\nRestructuring expenses were $1.2 million and $0.6 million for 2014 and 2013, respectively. The 2014 restructuring expenses included $0.6 million of employee severance obligations and $0.6 million relating to the termination of leased facilities. The 2013 restructuring expenses included $0.5 million of employee severance obligations and $0.1 million relating to the termination of leased facilities. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the balance of restructuring related obligations yet to be paid was $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively. The majority of obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 were paid during 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nGain on sale of building\nOn July 22, 2014, we sold a building and land owned by one of our subsidiaries reported in the United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment. We recognized a gain of approximately $11.7 million on this transaction in the third quarter of 2014, which has been classified as a Gain on sale of building\u201d in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nImpairment loss on goodwill and identifiable intangible assets\nIn conjunction with our 2014 annual impairment test on October 1, we recognized a $1.5 million non-cash impairment charge related to subsidiary trade names within the United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment and the United States building services segment. The 2014 impairment primarily resulted from lower forecasted revenues from two companies within these segments. No impairment of our identifiable intangible assets was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2013. Additionally, no impairment of our goodwill was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.\nOperating income (loss)\nThe following table presents by segment our operating income (loss) and each segment's operating income (loss) as a percentage of such segment's revenues from unrelated entities for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands, except for percentages):\n\nAs described in more detail below, we had operating income of $289.9 million for 2014 compared to operating income of $240.4 million for 2013. Operating margin was 4.5% and 3.8% for 2014 and 2013, respectively. Included within operating income for 2014 was an $11.7 million gain on the sale of a building, resulting in a 0.2% impact on our consolidated operating margin for 2014. Operating income for 2013 was negatively impacted by aggregate losses of approximately $24.5 million from one of our subsidiaries at two projects located in the southeastern United States, resulting in a 0.4% impact on our consolidated operating margin for 2013.\nOperating income of our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $90.9 million compared to operating income of $98.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily the result of a decrease in gross profit attributable to institutional, transportation, manufacturing and water and wastewater construction projects, as well as an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, mainly attributable to employment costs. This segment was also negatively impacted by project losses incurred from one of our subsidiaries whose operations we are in the process of closing. The decrease in operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily the result of an increase in the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to revenues.\nOur United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $114.4 million, a $20.7 million increase compared to operating income of $93.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Operating income was favorably impacted by an increase in gross profit from institutional, commercial, healthcare and hospitality construction projects, partially offset by a decrease in gross profit from manufacturing and transportation construction projects. The results for 2014 included the receipt of $3.0 million from former shareholders of a company we had acquired as a result of the settlement of a claim by us under the acquisition agreement; this payment has been recorded as a reduction of \"Cost of sales\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The results for 2013 included aggregate losses of approximately $24.5 million from one of our subsidiaries at two projects located in the southeastern United States, resulting in a 1.1% impact on this segment's operating margin, partially offset by $6.7 million of income attributable to the reversal of contingent consideration accruals related to acquisitions made prior to 2013. Companies acquired in 2013 generated operating income of $0.9 million, net of amortization expense of $0.2 million attributable to identifiable intangible assets, for the year ended December 31, 2014. These amounts reflect acquired companies' operating results in 2014 only for the time period these entities were not owned by EMCOR in the comparable 2013 period. The increase in operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2014 was attributable to an increase in gross profit margin.\nOperating income of our United States building services segment was $65.9 million and $67.2 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to a decrease in operating income from this segment's: (a) commercial site-based services operations, due to: (i) decreased volume from supplier management contracts and (ii) higher legal costs, including the unfavorable settlement of a legal matter, and (b) energy services operations, due to a reduction of large project work. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in gross profit from this segment's: (a) mobile mechanical services operations, partially due to increased profitability in projects, retrofits and repair services work and (b) government site-based services operations, partially due to the successful close-out of two large long-term joint venture projects and reduced selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase in operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2014 was attributable to an increase in gross profit margin.\nOperating income of our United States industrial services segment for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $24.4 million compared to operating income for the year ended December 31, 2013. For the seven months ended July 31, 2014, RSI contributed $8.4 million of operating income, net of $8.0 million of amortization expense attributable to identifiable intangible assets. These amounts reflect RSI's operating results in 2014 only for the time period RSI was not owned by EMCOR in the comparable 2013 period. Operating income also benefited from an increase in demand for this segment's industrial field services. The increase in operating income was partially offset by a reduction in operating income from our industrial shop services operations, which had benefited from exceptionally strong demand during the first quarter of 2013.\nOur United Kingdom building services segment's operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $15.0 million compared to operating income of $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. This segment recognized income of $4.8 million during the second quarter of 2014, which has been recorded as a reduction of \"Cost of sales\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, as a result of a reduction in the estimate of certain accrued contract costs that were no longer expected to be incurred, which was partially offset by a decrease in income from the commercial and transportation markets. The increase in operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2014 was attributable to an increase in gross profit margin and a decrease in the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to revenues.\nOur corporate administration operating loss was $68.6 million for 2014 compared to $69.9 million in 2013. Our corporate administration operating loss for 2013 included $6.1 million of transaction costs associated with the acquisition of RSI. The benefit of the absence of these transaction costs for 2014 was partially offset by an increase in certain employment costs, such as incentive\ncompensation and employee benefits. Also, our corporate administration operating loss for 2013 was reduced by the receipt of an insurance recovery of approximately $2.6 million that was received in January 2013 associated with a previously disposed of operation, which is classified as a component of \"Cost of sales\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nNon-operating items\nInterest expense was $9.1 million and $8.8 million for 2014 and 2013, respectively. The $0.3 million increase in interest expense for 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to increased borrowings associated with the term loan executed in November 2013.\nInterest income was $0.8 million and $1.1 million for 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decrease in interest income was primarily related to lower invested cash balances.\nFor joint ventures that have been accounted for using the consolidation method of accounting, noncontrolling interest represents the allocation of earnings to our joint venture partners who either have a minority-ownership interest in the joint venture or are not at risk for the majority of losses of the joint venture.\nOur 2014 income tax provision from continuing operations was $103.5 million compared to $82.3 million for 2013. The actual income tax rates on income from continuing operations before income taxes, less amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, were 37.4% and 35.9%, respectively. The increase in the 2014 income tax provision compared to 2013 was primarily due to the effect of increased income before income taxes and the 2013 reversal of previously unrecognized income tax benefits.\nDiscontinued operations\nDue to a historical pattern of losses in the construction operations of our United Kingdom segment and our negative assessment of construction market conditions in the United Kingdom for the foreseeable future, we announced during the quarter ended June 30, 2013 our decision to withdraw from the construction market in the United Kingdom. During the third quarter of 2014, we ceased construction operations in the United Kingdom. The results of the construction operations of our United Kingdom segment for all periods are presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements as discontinued operations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table presents net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):\n\nOur consolidated cash balance increased by approximately $54.8 million from $432.1 million at December 31, 2014 to $486.8 million at December 31, 2015. Net cash provided by operating activities for 2015 was $266.7 million compared to $246.7 million of net cash provided by operating activities for 2014. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to: (a) a $70.7 million increase in net over-billings related to the timing of customer billings and payments, (b) a $50.6 million increase in accounts payable and (c) a $40.5 million increase in other working capital changes, partially offset by a $142.7 million increase in accounts receivable. Net cash used in investing activities was $59.8 million for 2015 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $21.7 million for 2014. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to payments to acquire businesses in 2015. Net cash used in financing activities for 2015 decreased by approximately $80.5 million compared to 2014. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to a decrease in funds used for the repurchase of common stock. Cash flows from discontinued operations were immaterial and are not expected to significantly affect future liquidity.\nOur consolidated cash balance decreased by approximately $7.8 million from $439.8 million at December 31, 2013 to $432.1 million at December 31, 2014. Net cash provided by operating activities for 2014 was $246.7 million compared to $150.1 million of net cash provided by operating activities for 2013. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to: (a) a $46.1 million increase in net income, (b) a $30.6 million decrease in accounts receivable and (c) a $16.0 million reduction in income taxes paid, partially offset by a $12.2 million decrease in accounts payable. Net cash used in investing activities was $21.7 million for 2014 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $483.4 million for 2013. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the lack of acquisitions in 2014. Net cash used in financing activities for 2014 increased by approximately $397.0 million compared to 2013. The increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an\nincrease in funds used for the repurchase of common stock of $175.9 million, the repayment of long-term debt, and the payment of regular quarterly dividends to stockholders, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nThe following is a summary of material contractual obligations and other commercial commitments (in millions):\n\n\n_________\n (1) On November",
    "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe are one of the largest electrical and mechanical construction and facilities services firms in the United States. In addition, we provide a number of building services and industrial services. Our services are provided to a broad range of commercial, industrial, utility and institutional customers through approximately 70 operating subsidiaries and joint venture entities. Our offices are located in the United States and the United Kingdom.\nOperating Segments\nWe have the following reportable segments which provide services associated with the design, integration, installation, start-up, operation and maintenance of various systems: (a) United States electrical construction and facilities services (involving systems for electrical power transmission and distribution; premises electrical and lighting systems; low-voltage systems, such as fire alarm, security and process control; voice and data communication; roadway and transit lighting; and fiber optic lines); (b) United States mechanical construction and facilities services (involving systems for heating, ventilation, air conditioning, refrigeration and clean-room process ventilation; fire protection; plumbing, process and high-purity piping; controls and filtration; water and wastewater treatment; central plant heating and cooling; cranes and rigging; millwrighting; and steel fabrication, erection and welding); (c) United States building services; (d) United States industrial services; and (e) United Kingdom building services. The United States building services\u201d and United Kingdom building services\u201d segments principally consist of those operations which provide a portfolio of services needed to support the operation and maintenance of customers' facilities, including commercial and government site-based operations and maintenance; facility maintenance and services, including reception, security and catering services; outage services to utilities and industrial plants; military base operations support services; mobile maintenance and services; floor care and janitorial services; landscaping, lot sweeping and snow removal; facilities management; vendor management; call center services; installation and support for building systems; program development, management and maintenance for energy systems; technical consulting and diagnostic services; infrastructure and building projects for federal, state and local governmental agencies and bodies; and small modification and retrofit projects, which services are not generally related to customers' construction programs.

In addition, we completed two other acquisitions during 2013, and their results have been included in our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment. These acquired businesses expanded our service capabilities into new technical areas.\n2015 versus 2014\nOverview\nThe following table presents selected financial data for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands, except percentages and per share data):\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,718,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,424,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues increase from prior year\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment loss on identifiable intangible assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of building\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>287,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>289,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income as a percentage of revenues\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>172,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>178,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to EMCOR Group, Inc.\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>172,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.59\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe results of our operations for 2015 set new Company records in terms of revenues and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. Our 2015 results included increased revenues from all of our reportable segments. In addition, excluding the impact of the $11.7 million gain on the sale of a building and the $1.5 million impairment loss on identifiable intangible assets in 2014, our operating income (operating income as a percentage of revenues) increased in 2015 compared to 2014. Our overall 2015 operating income and operating margin were favorably impacted by improved operating performance within: (a) our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment, partially attributable to revenues of $12.1 million recognized as a result of the settlement of a claim on an institutional project located in the southeastern United States, and (b) our United States building services segment, as a result of increased profitability within this segment's mobile mechanical and commercial site-based services operations.\nOur operating results for 2015 were negatively impacted by: (a) our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment, (b) our United States industrial services segment and (c) our United Kingdom building services segment. Decreases in both operating income and operating margin within our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment were partially attributable to approximately $10.1 million of losses incurred on several transportation projects. Decreases in both operating income and operating margin within our United States industrial services segment were primarily due to: (a) the negative impact of a nationwide strike by union employees of certain major oil refineries in the first half of 2015, which led to both deferrals and losses of certain turnaround projects that generate relatively high gross profit margins, and (b) a decrease in the billing rates and related gross profit margins within our industrial shop services operations due to competitive market conditions resulting from decreased demand for new heat exchangers as a result of volatility in crude oil prices that led to a curtailment in capital spending.\nTwo of the companies acquired in 2015, which are reported in our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment, generated incremental revenues of $12.5 million and less than $0.1 million of operating income, net of $0.3 million of amortization expense associated with identifiable intangible assets. The results of operations for the third company acquired in 2015, which are reported in our United States building services segment, were de minimis.\nDiscussion and Analysis of Results of Operations\nRevenues\nAs described in more detail below, revenues for 2015 were $6.7 billion compared to $6.4 billion for 2014. The increase in revenues for 2015 was primarily attributable to: (a) increased revenues from both of our domestic construction segments, (b) increased demand for our industrial field services within our United States industrial services segment and (c) increased revenues from our mobile mechanical services operations within our United States building services segment. Revenues increased within our United States industrial services segment despite a nationwide strike by union employees of certain major oil refineries that negatively impacted the first half of 2015.\nThe following table presents our revenues for each of our operating segments and the approximate percentages that each segment's revenues were of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands, except for percentages):\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nTotal\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues from unrelated entities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States electrical construction and facilities services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,367,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,311,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States mechanical construction and facilities services\n</td> <td>2,312,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,201,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States building services\n</td> <td>1,739,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,721,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States industrial services\n</td> <td>922,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>839,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total United States operations\n</td> <td>6,341,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,074,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United Kingdom building services\n</td> <td>377,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>350,444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total worldwide operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,718,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,424,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues of our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment were $1,367.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to revenues of $1,312.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in revenues from commercial, healthcare and manufacturing construction projects, partially offset by a decrease in revenues from institutional construction projects.\nOur United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $2,312.8 million, a $111.6 million increase compared to revenues of $2,201.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in revenues from commercial and institutional construction projects, partially offset by a decline in revenues from manufacturing, water and wastewater and transportation construction projects. The results for the year ended December 31, 2015 included $12.5 million of revenues generated by companies acquired in 2015.\nRevenues of our United States building services segment were $1,739.3 million and $1,721.3 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in revenues was primarily attributable to increased revenues from: (a) our mobile mechanical services operations, in part due to significant activity in the California and New England regions and increased project and retrofit activities, and (b) our energy services operations. These increases were partially offset by decreased revenues from: (a) our government site-based services operations as a result of the completion in 2014 of two large long-term site-based joint venture projects not renewed pursuant to rebid, (b) our commercial site-based services operations as a result of: (i) a decline in add-on project activities, (ii) a decrease in revenues from its snow removal activities, as a result of less snowfall in geographical areas in which many of our contracts are based on a per snow event basis, and (iii) a decrease in revenues from supplier management contracts.\nRevenues of our United States industrial services segment for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $82.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in revenues was primarily due to large capital and maintenance project activity within our industrial field services operations. Revenues increased within this segment despite a nationwide strike by union employees of certain major oil refineries that negatively impacted the first half of 2015.\nOur United Kingdom building services segment revenues were $377.5 million in 2015 compared to $350.4 million in 2014. The increase in revenues was due to an increase in activity in the commercial market attributable to several new contract awards as well as increased work under existing contracts. The increase in revenues was partially offset by a decrease of $29.2 million relating to the effect of unfavorable exchange rates for the British pound versus the United States dollar.\nBacklog\nThe following table presents our operating segment backlog from unrelated entities and their respective percentages of total backlog (in thousands, except for percentages):\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nTotal\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Backlog:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States electrical construction and facilities services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,145,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,176,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States mechanical construction and facilities services\n</td> <td>1,683,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,473,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States building services\n</td> <td>762,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>732,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States industrial services\n</td> <td>54,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total United States operations\n</td> <td>3,646,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,483,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United Kingdom building services\n</td> <td>125,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total worldwide operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,771,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,633,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur backlog at December 31, 2015 was $3.77 billion compared to $3.63 billion at December 31, 2014. This increase in backlog was primarily attributable to an increase in backlog from our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment and our United States building services segment, partially offset by lower backlog from our other reportable segments. Backlog increases with awards of new contracts and decreases as we perform work on existing contracts. Backlog is not a term recognized under United States generally accepted accounting principles; however, it is a common measurement used in our industry. We include a project within our backlog at such time as a contract is awarded and agreement on contract terms has been reached. Backlog includes unrecognized revenues to be realized from uncompleted construction contracts plus unrecognized revenues expected to be realized over the remaining term of services contracts. However, we do not include in backlog contracts for which we are paid on a time and material basis and a fixed amount cannot be determined, and if the remaining term of a services contract exceeds 12 months, the unrecognized revenues attributable to such contract included in backlog are limited to only the next 12 months of revenues provided for in the contract award. Our backlog also includes amounts related to services contracts for which a fixed price contract value is not assigned when a reasonable estimate of total revenues can be made from budgeted amounts agreed to with our customer. Our backlog is comprised of: (a) original contract amounts, (b) change orders for which we have received written confirmations from our customers, (c) pending change orders for which we expect to receive confirmations in the ordinary course of business and (d) claim amounts that we have made against customers for which we have determined we have a legal basis under existing contractual arrangements and as to which we consider recovery to be probable. Such claim amounts were immaterial for all periods presented. Our backlog does not include anticipated revenues from unconsolidated joint ventures or variable interest entities and anticipated revenues from pass-through costs on contracts for which we are acting in the capacity of an agent and which are reported on the net basis. We believe our backlog is firm, although many contracts are subject to cancellation at the election of our customers. Historically, cancellations have not had a material adverse effect on us.\nCost of sales and Gross profit\nThe following table presents cost of sales, gross profit (revenues less cost of sales), and gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of revenues) for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands, except for percentages):\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,774,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,517,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>944,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>907,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit margin\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $944.5 million, a $37.2 million increase compared to the gross profit of $907.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our gross profit margin was 14.1% for both 2015 and 2014. Favorable variances in both gross profit and gross profit margin within: (a) our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment, which included revenues of $12.1 million recognized as a result of the settlement of a claim on an institutional project located in the southeastern United States, and (b) our United States building services segment were partially offset by decreases in gross profit and gross profit margin within our United Kingdom building services and our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment. Gross profit within our United States industrial services segment slightly increased; however, gross margin within this segment declined due to a decrease in the billing rates and related gross profit margins within our industrial shop services operations due to competitive market conditions resulting from decreased demand for new heat exchangers as a result of volatility in crude oil prices that led to a curtailment in capital spending.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nThe following table presents selling, general and administrative expenses and SG&A margin (selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues) for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands, except for percentages):\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>656,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>626,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues\n</td> <td>9.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $656.6 million, a $30.1 million increase compared to selling, general and administrative expenses of $626.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 9.8% for both 2015 and 2014. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was due to higher employee related costs such as incentive compensation, salaries and medical insurance costs, as well as certain other costs including computer hardware and software expenses, partially offset by a decrease in legal costs. Increased incentive compensation was principally due to higher annual operating results within certain operations than in 2014, which resulted in increased accruals for their incentive compensation plans. The increase in salaries was attributable to an increase in headcount, commensurate with an increase in revenues, as well as cost of living adjustments and merit pay increases.\nRestructuring expenses\nRestructuring expenses were $0.8 million and $1.2 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The 2015 restructuring expenses included $0.9 million of employee severance obligations and the reversal of $0.1 million relating to the termination of leased facilities. The 2014 restructuring expenses included $0.6 million of employee severance obligations and $0.6 million relating to the termination of leased facilities. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the balance of restructuring related obligations yet to be paid was $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively. The majority of obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2014 was paid during 2015. The obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2015 will be paid during the first half of 2016.\nGain on sale of building\nOn July 22, 2014, we sold a building and land owned by one of our subsidiaries reported in the United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment. We recognized a gain of approximately $11.7 million on this transaction in the third quarter of 2014, which has been classified as a Gain on sale of building\u201d in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nImpairment loss on goodwill and identifiable intangible assets\nNo impairment of our identifiable intangible assets was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2015. In conjunction with our 2014 annual impairment test on October 1, we recognized a $1.5 million non-cash impairment charge related to subsidiary trade names within the United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment and the United States building services segment. The 2014 impairment primarily resulted from lower forecasted revenues from two companies within these segments. Additionally, no impairment of our goodwill was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nOperating income (loss)\nThe following table presents by segment our operating income (loss) and each segment's operating income (loss) as a percentage of such segment's revenues from unrelated entities for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands, except for percentages):\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nSegment\nRevenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nSegment\nRevenues\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States electrical construction and facilities services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States mechanical construction and facilities services\n</td> <td>138,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States building services\n</td> <td>70,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States industrial services\n</td> <td>56,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total United States operations\n</td> <td>347,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>334,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United Kingdom building services\n</td> <td>11,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate administration\n</td> <td>(71,642\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(68,578\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring expenses\n</td> <td>(824\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,168\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment loss on identifiable intangible assets\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,471\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of building\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total worldwide operations\n</td> <td>287,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>289,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other corporate items:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(8,932\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,075\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from continuing operations before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>278,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>281,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs described in more detail below, we had operating income of $287.1 million for 2015 compared to operating income of $289.9 million for 2014. Operating margin was 4.3% and 4.5% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. Included within operating income for 2014 was an $11.7 million gain on the sale of a building, resulting in a 0.2% impact on our consolidated operating margin for 2014.\nOperating income of our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $82.2 million compared to operating income of $90.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was due to a decrease in gross profit from transportation, institutional and manufacturing construction projects and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses due to higher employee related costs such as incentive compensation and salaries. The decrease in gross profit from transportation construction projects included approximately $10.1 million of losses incurred on several projects due to productivity issues and delays. The increase in incentive compensation was principally due to higher annual operating results within certain operations than in 2014, which resulted in increased accruals for certain of our incentive compensation plans. The decrease in operating income was partially offset by an increase in gross profit from: (a) commercial construction projects, partially due to profits recognized on contracts in the Mid-Atlantic region and (b) healthcare construction projects. The decrease in operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 was attributable to a decrease in gross profit margin, partially as a result of losses recorded on transportation projects, as well as an increase in the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to revenues resulting from an increase in incentive compensation due to higher annual operating results within certain operations than in 2014.\nOur United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $138.7 million, a $24.3 million increase compared to operating income of $114.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Operating income was favorably impacted by an increase in gross profit from institutional, commercial and manufacturing construction projects, partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. The results for 2015 included revenues of $12.1 million recognized as a result of the settlement of a claim on an institutional project located in the southeastern United States. The results for 2014 included the receipt of $3.0 million from former shareholders of a company we had acquired as a result of the settlement of a claim by us under the acquisition agreement; this payment has been recorded as a reduction of \"Cost of sales\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of an increase in incentive compensation due to higher annual operating results than in 2014, which resulted in increased accruals for certain of our incentive compensation plans. Companies acquired in 2015 generated operating income of less than $0.1 million, net of amortization expense of $0.3 million attributable to identifiable intangible assets. The increase in operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 was attributable to an increase in gross profit margin.\nOperating income of our United States building services segment was $70.5 million and $65.9 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to improved performance from: (a) our mobile mechanical services operations, partially due to increased profitability in projects, retrofits, repair services work and service contracts, and (b) our commercial site-based services operations, partially due to a reduction in legal costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in operating income from: (a) our energy services operations as, in 2014, we benefited from the successful completion of a large project and (b) our government site-based services operations as a result of the completion in 2014 of two large long-term site-based joint venture projects not renewed pursuant to rebid. The results for the year ended December 31, 2015 included income of approximately $2.7 million, net of associated legal costs, upon the favorable settlement of a claim by us against the former owner of a company we had previously acquired within our commercial site-based services operations. The increase in operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 was attributable to an increase in gross profit margin.\nOperating income of our United States industrial services segment for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $6.7 million compared to operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to: (a) a decrease in gross profit from our industrial shop services operations due to: (i) a decrease in the billing rates and related gross profit margins due to competitive market conditions resulting from decreased demand for new heat exchangers as a result of volatility in crude oil prices that led to a curtailment in capital spending and (ii) the mix of work, which included fewer repair projects than in 2014, that generate relatively high gross profit margins, (b) the negative impact of a nationwide strike by union employees of certain major oil refineries in the first half of 2015, which led to both deferrals and losses of certain turnaround projects that generate relatively high gross profit margins, and (c) an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses due to higher employee related costs such as salaries and employee benefits, partially as a result of increased headcount. The decrease in operating income was partially offset by large capital and maintenance project activity within our industrial field services operations. The decrease in operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 was attributable to a decrease in gross profit margin.\nOur United Kingdom building services segment's operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $11.6 million compared to operating income of $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in operating income and operating margin was primarily attributable to the impact of $4.8 million of income recognized in the second quarter of 2014 as a result of a reduction in the estimate of certain accrued contract costs that were no longer expected to be incurred. The overall decrease in gross profit in this segment was partially offset by an increase in gross profit from both new contract awards and increased project activity within the commercial market. This segment recorded a decrease in operating income of $0.9 million relating to the effect of unfavorable exchange rates for the British pound versus the United States dollar.\nOur corporate administration operating loss was $71.6 million for 2015 compared to $68.6 million in 2014. The increase in expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to an increase in certain employment costs, such as incentive compensation and salaries, as well as certain other expenses including legal costs. The increase in incentive compensation was partially due to higher awards earned than in 2014, which resulted in increased accruals for certain of our incentive compensation plans.\nNon-operating items\nInterest expense was $8.9 million and $9.1 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in interest expense for 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to lower borrowings outstanding.\nInterest income was $0.7 million and $0.8 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in interest income was primarily related to lower invested cash balances.\nFor joint ventures that have been accounted for using the consolidation method of accounting, noncontrolling interest represents the allocation of earnings to our joint venture partners who either have a minority-ownership interest in the joint venture or are not at risk for the majority of losses of the joint venture.\nOur 2015 income tax provision from continuing operations was $106.3 million compared to $103.5 million for 2014. The actual income tax rates on income from continuing operations before income taxes, less amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, were 38.1% and 37.4%, respectively. The increase in the 2015 income tax provision compared to 2014 was predominantly due to certain increases in the state tax provision attributable to the mix of earnings and the effect of a change in the United Kingdom statutory tax rate on deferred tax assets.\nDiscontinued operations\nDue to a historical pattern of losses in the construction operations of our United Kingdom segment and our negative assessment of construction market conditions in the United Kingdom for the foreseeable future, we announced during the quarter ended June 30, 2013 our decision to withdraw from the construction market in the United Kingdom. During the third quarter of 2014, we ceased construction operations in the United Kingdom. The results of the construction operations of our United Kingdom segment for all periods are presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements as discontinued operations.\n2014 versus 2013\nOverview\nThe following table presents selected financial data for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands, except percentages and per share data):\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,424,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,333,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues increase from prior year\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>647\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment loss on identifiable intangible assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of building\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>289,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>240,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income as a percentage of revenues\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>178,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to EMCOR Group, Inc.\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>123,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverall revenues, operating income and operating margin (operating income as a percentage of revenues) increased in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase in revenues is primarily attributable to higher revenues from our United States industrial services segment and our United Kingdom building services segment, partially offset by a decline in revenues from our (a) United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment, (b) United States building services segment and (c) United States electrical construction and facilities services segment. Companies acquired in 2013, which are reported in our United States industrial segment and our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment, generated incremental revenues of $231.2 million in 2014. This amount reflects acquired companies' revenues in 2014 only for the time period these entities were not owned by EMCOR in the comparable 2013 period.\nThe increases in operating income were primarily attributable to improved operating performance within all of our reportable segments, except for our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment and our United States building services segment. Operating income margins increased within all of our reportable segments, except for our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment and our United States industrial services segment. In addition, our operating income and operating margin were favorably impacted by an $11.7 million gain on the sale of a building. Companies acquired in 2013, which are reported in our United States industrial segment and our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment, contributed $9.3 million to operating income, net of $8.2 million of amortization expense associated with identifiable intangible assets. These amounts reflect acquired companies' operating results in 2014 only for the time period these entities were not owned by EMCOR in the comparable 2013 period.\nDiscussion and Analysis of Results of Operations\nRevenues\nAs described in more detail below, revenues for 2014 were $6.4 billion compared to $6.3 billion for 2013. The increase in revenues for 2014 was primarily attributable to revenues of $231.2 million attributable to companies acquired in 2013 (which reflects acquired companies' revenues in 2014 only for the time period these entities were not owned by EMCOR in the comparable 2013 period) and higher revenues from our United States industrial services segment and our United Kingdom building services segment. This increase was partially offset by lower revenues from our other reportable segments.\nThe following table presents our revenues for each of our operating segments and the approximate percentages that each segment's revenues were of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands, except for percentages):\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nTotal\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues from unrelated entities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States electrical construction and facilities services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,311,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,345,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States mechanical construction and facilities services\n</td> <td>2,201,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,329,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States building services\n</td> <td>1,721,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,794,978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States industrial services\n</td> <td>839,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>519,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total United States operations\n</td> <td>6,074,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,989,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United Kingdom building services\n</td> <td>350,444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>343,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total worldwide operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,424,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,333,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues of our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment were $1,312.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to revenues of $1,345.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenues from institutional and manufacturing construction projects, primarily in the southern California and Washington D.C. markets, as well as a decrease in revenues from water and wastewater construction projects. These decreases were partially offset by higher levels of work from transportation, commercial and healthcare projects.\nOur United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $2,201.2 million, a $128.6 million decrease compared to revenues of $2,329.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. This decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to a decline in revenues from manufacturing construction projects, partially as the result of the completion in 2013 of several large projects within this market sector, which were not replaced. This decrease was partially offset by: (a) an increase in revenues from commercial, hospitality and institutional construction projects and (b) incremental revenues of $19.2 million generated by companies acquired in 2013. This amount reflects acquired companies' revenues in 2014 only for the time period these entities were not owned by EMCOR in the comparable 2013 period.\nRevenues of our United States building services segment were $1,721.3 million and $1,795.0 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. This decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to decreased revenues from: (a) our commercial site-based services operations, as a result of a decline in revenues from supplier management contracts, including a large contract that was terminated by agreement of both parties, (b) our energy services operations, due to a reduction in large project work, and (c) our government site-based services operations, as a result of the completion of a large long-term site-based joint venture project located in the Pacific Northwest not renewed pursuant to rebid. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in revenues from our mobile mechanical service operations, primarily within the California and New England markets.\nRevenues of our United States industrial services segment for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $320.6 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. For the seven months ended July 31, 2014, RSI generated incremental revenues of $212.0 million. This amount reflects RSI's revenues in 2014 only for the time period RSI was not owned by EMCOR in the comparable 2013 period. The increase in revenues was also attributable to an increased demand for our industrial field services operations, partially offset by a decrease in revenues from our industrial shop services operations.\nOur United Kingdom building services segment revenues were $350.4 million in 2014 compared to $343.6 million in 2013. This increase in revenues was due to an increase of $16.9 million relating to the effect of favorable exchange rates for the British pound versus the United States dollar and increased activity within the commercial and healthcare markets, partially offset by decreased activity within the transportation and institutional markets.\nBacklog\nThe following table presents our operating segment backlog from unrelated entities and their respective percentages of total backlog (in thousands, except for percentages):\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nTotal\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Backlog:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States electrical construction and facilities services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,176,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>993,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States mechanical construction and facilities services\n</td> <td>1,473,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,325,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States building services\n</td> <td>732,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>761,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States industrial services\n</td> <td>101,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total United States operations\n</td> <td>3,483,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,175,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United Kingdom building services\n</td> <td>150,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>167,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total worldwide operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,633,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,343,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur backlog at December 31, 2014 was $3.63 billion compared to $3.34 billion at December 31, 2013. This increase in backlog was primarily attributable to an increase in contracts awarded for work in our: (a) United States electrical construction and facilities services segment and (b) United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment. Backlog increases with awards of new contracts and decreases as we perform work on existing contracts.\nCost of sales and Gross profit\nThe following table presents cost of sales, gross profit (revenues less cost of sales), and gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of revenues) for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands, except for percentages):\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,517,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,511,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>907,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>821,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit margin\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $907.2 million, an $85.6 million increase compared to the gross profit of $821.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to improved profitability within all of our reportable segments, except for our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment. Gross profit in 2013 within our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment was negatively impacted by aggregate losses of approximately $24.5 million from one of our subsidiaries at two projects located in the southeastern United States. Companies acquired in 2013 included in our United States industrial services segment and our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment contributed an aggregate of $35.9 million to gross profit in 2014. This amount reflects acquired companies' gross profit in 2014 only for the time period these entities were not owned by EMCOR in the comparable 2013 period.\nOur gross profit margin was 14.1% and 13.0% for 2014 and 2013, respectively. Gross profit margin for 2014 increased within most of our reportable segments. Our consolidated gross profit margin benefited from an increase in revenues from our United States industrial services segment, which historically generates higher gross profit margins than our other reportable segments. Gross profit margin for 2013 was adversely impacted by the two significant project write-downs reported in our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment, resulting in a 0.4% impact on consolidated gross profit margin.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nThe following table presents selling, general and administrative expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands, except for percentages):\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>626,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>580,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues\n</td> <td>9.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $626.5 million, a $45.8 million increase compared to selling, general and administrative expenses of $580.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 9.8% and 9.2% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. This increase in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily resulted from: (a) $26.6 million of\nexpenses directly related to companies acquired in 2013, including amortization expense of $8.2 million attributable to identifiable intangible assets (which reflect acquired companies' expenses in 2014 only for the time period these entities were not owned by EMCOR in the comparable 2013 period), (b) higher employee related costs such as incentive compensation and employee benefits and (c) higher legal costs, including the unfavorable settlement of a legal matter. In addition, our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased due to higher revenues from our United States industrial services segment, which has a higher fixed cost structure than our other reportable segments. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013 included $6.1 million of transaction costs associated with the acquisition of RSI. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013 were reduced by $6.8 million of income attributable to the reversal of contingent consideration accruals relating to acquisitions made prior to 2013.\nRestructuring expenses\nRestructuring expenses were $1.2 million and $0.6 million for 2014 and 2013, respectively. The 2014 restructuring expenses included $0.6 million of employee severance obligations and $0.6 million relating to the termination of leased facilities. The 2013 restructuring expenses included $0.5 million of employee severance obligations and $0.1 million relating to the termination of leased facilities. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the balance of restructuring related obligations yet to be paid was $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively. The majority of obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 were paid during 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nGain on sale of building\nOn July 22, 2014, we sold a building and land owned by one of our subsidiaries reported in the United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment. We recognized a gain of approximately $11.7 million on this transaction in the third quarter of 2014, which has been classified as a Gain on sale of building\u201d in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nImpairment loss on goodwill and identifiable intangible assets\nIn conjunction with our 2014 annual impairment test on October 1, we recognized a $1.5 million non-cash impairment charge related to subsidiary trade names within the United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment and the United States building services segment. The 2014 impairment primarily resulted from lower forecasted revenues from two companies within these segments. No impairment of our identifiable intangible assets was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2013. Additionally, no impairment of our goodwill was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.\nOperating income (loss)\nThe following table presents by segment our operating income (loss) and each segment's operating income (loss) as a percentage of such segment's revenues from unrelated entities for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands, except for percentages):\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nSegment\nRevenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nSegment\nRevenues\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States electrical construction and facilities services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>98,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States mechanical construction and facilities services\n</td> <td>114,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States building services\n</td> <td>65,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States industrial services\n</td> <td>63,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total United States operations\n</td> <td>334,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>297,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United Kingdom building services\n</td> <td>15,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate administration\n</td> <td>(68,578\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(69,891\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring expenses\n</td> <td>(1,168\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(647\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment loss on identifiable intangible assets\n</td> <td>(1,471\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of building\n</td> <td>11,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total worldwide operations\n</td> <td>289,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>240,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other corporate items:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(9,075\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,769\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from continuing operations before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>281,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>232,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs described in more detail below, we had operating income of $289.9 million for 2014 compared to operating income of $240.4 million for 2013. Operating margin was 4.5% and 3.8% for 2014 and 2013, respectively. Included within operating income for 2014 was an $11.7 million gain on the sale of a building, resulting in a 0.2% impact on our consolidated operating margin for 2014. Operating income for 2013 was negatively impacted by aggregate losses of approximately $24.5 million from one of our subsidiaries at two projects located in the southeastern United States, resulting in a 0.4% impact on our consolidated operating margin for 2013.\nOperating income of our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $90.9 million compared to operating income of $98.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily the result of a decrease in gross profit attributable to institutional, transportation, manufacturing and water and wastewater construction projects, as well as an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, mainly attributable to employment costs. This segment was also negatively impacted by project losses incurred from one of our subsidiaries whose operations we are in the process of closing. The decrease in operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily the result of an increase in the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to revenues.\nOur United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $114.4 million, a $20.7 million increase compared to operating income of $93.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Operating income was favorably impacted by an increase in gross profit from institutional, commercial, healthcare and hospitality construction projects, partially offset by a decrease in gross profit from manufacturing and transportation construction projects. The results for 2014 included the receipt of $3.0 million from former shareholders of a company we had acquired as a result of the settlement of a claim by us under the acquisition agreement; this payment has been recorded as a reduction of \"Cost of sales\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The results for 2013 included aggregate losses of approximately $24.5 million from one of our subsidiaries at two projects located in the southeastern United States, resulting in a 1.1% impact on this segment's operating margin, partially offset by $6.7 million of income attributable to the reversal of contingent consideration accruals related to acquisitions made prior to 2013. Companies acquired in 2013 generated operating income of $0.9 million, net of amortization expense of $0.2 million attributable to identifiable intangible assets, for the year ended December 31, 2014. These amounts reflect acquired companies' operating results in 2014 only for the time period these entities were not owned by EMCOR in the comparable 2013 period. The increase in operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2014 was attributable to an increase in gross profit margin.\nOperating income of our United States building services segment was $65.9 million and $67.2 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to a decrease in operating income from this segment's: (a) commercial site-based services operations, due to: (i) decreased volume from supplier management contracts and (ii) higher legal costs, including the unfavorable settlement of a legal matter, and (b) energy services operations, due to a reduction of large project work. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in gross profit from this segment's: (a) mobile mechanical services operations, partially due to increased profitability in projects, retrofits and repair services work and (b) government site-based services operations, partially due to the successful close-out of two large long-term joint venture projects and reduced selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase in operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2014 was attributable to an increase in gross profit margin.\nOperating income of our United States industrial services segment for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $24.4 million compared to operating income for the year ended December 31, 2013. For the seven months ended July 31, 2014, RSI contributed $8.4 million of operating income, net of $8.0 million of amortization expense attributable to identifiable intangible assets. These amounts reflect RSI's operating results in 2014 only for the time period RSI was not owned by EMCOR in the comparable 2013 period. Operating income also benefited from an increase in demand for this segment's industrial field services. The increase in operating income was partially offset by a reduction in operating income from our industrial shop services operations, which had benefited from exceptionally strong demand during the first quarter of 2013.\nOur United Kingdom building services segment's operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $15.0 million compared to operating income of $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. This segment recognized income of $4.8 million during the second quarter of 2014, which has been recorded as a reduction of \"Cost of sales\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, as a result of a reduction in the estimate of certain accrued contract costs that were no longer expected to be incurred, which was partially offset by a decrease in income from the commercial and transportation markets. The increase in operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2014 was attributable to an increase in gross profit margin and a decrease in the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to revenues.\nOur corporate administration operating loss was $68.6 million for 2014 compared to $69.9 million in 2013. Our corporate administration operating loss for 2013 included $6.1 million of transaction costs associated with the acquisition of RSI. The benefit of the absence of these transaction costs for 2014 was partially offset by an increase in certain employment costs, such as incentive\ncompensation and employee benefits. Also, our corporate administration operating loss for 2013 was reduced by the receipt of an insurance recovery of approximately $2.6 million that was received in January 2013 associated with a previously disposed of operation, which is classified as a component of \"Cost of sales\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nNon-operating items\nInterest expense was $9.1 million and $8.8 million for 2014 and 2013, respectively. The $0.3 million increase in interest expense for 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to increased borrowings associated with the term loan executed in November 2013.\nInterest income was $0.8 million and $1.1 million for 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decrease in interest income was primarily related to lower invested cash balances.\nFor joint ventures that have been accounted for using the consolidation method of accounting, noncontrolling interest represents the allocation of earnings to our joint venture partners who either have a minority-ownership interest in the joint venture or are not at risk for the majority of losses of the joint venture.\nOur 2014 income tax provision from continuing operations was $103.5 million compared to $82.3 million for 2013. The actual income tax rates on income from continuing operations before income taxes, less amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, were 37.4% and 35.9%, respectively. The increase in the 2014 income tax provision compared to 2013 was primarily due to the effect of increased income before income taxes and the 2013 reversal of previously unrecognized income tax benefits.\nDiscontinued operations\nDue to a historical pattern of losses in the construction operations of our United Kingdom segment and our negative assessment of construction market conditions in the United Kingdom for the foreseeable future, we announced during the quarter ended June 30, 2013 our decision to withdraw from the construction market in the United Kingdom. During the third quarter of 2014, we ceased construction operations in the United Kingdom. The results of the construction operations of our United Kingdom segment for all periods are presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements as discontinued operations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table presents net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>266,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>246,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(59,808\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(21,668\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(483,422\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(149,473\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(229,950\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>167,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,610\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,796\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>832\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur consolidated cash balance increased by approximately $54.8 million from $432.1 million at December 31, 2014 to $486.8 million at December 31, 2015. Net cash provided by operating activities for 2015 was $266.7 million compared to $246.7 million of net cash provided by operating activities for 2014. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to: (a) a $70.7 million increase in net over-billings related to the timing of customer billings and payments, (b) a $50.6 million increase in accounts payable and (c) a $40.5 million increase in other working capital changes, partially offset by a $142.7 million increase in accounts receivable. Net cash used in investing activities was $59.8 million for 2015 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $21.7 million for 2014. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to payments to acquire businesses in 2015. Net cash used in financing activities for 2015 decreased by approximately $80.5 million compared to 2014. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to a decrease in funds used for the repurchase of common stock. Cash flows from discontinued operations were immaterial and are not expected to significantly affect future liquidity.\nOur consolidated cash balance decreased by approximately $7.8 million from $439.8 million at December 31, 2013 to $432.1 million at December 31, 2014. Net cash provided by operating activities for 2014 was $246.7 million compared to $150.1 million of net cash provided by operating activities for 2013. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to: (a) a $46.1 million increase in net income, (b) a $30.6 million decrease in accounts receivable and (c) a $16.0 million reduction in income taxes paid, partially offset by a $12.2 million decrease in accounts payable. Net cash used in investing activities was $21.7 million for 2014 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $483.4 million for 2013. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the lack of acquisitions in 2014. Net cash used in financing activities for 2014 increased by approximately $397.0 million compared to 2013. The increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an\nincrease in funds used for the repurchase of common stock of $175.9 million, the repayment of long-term debt, and the payment of regular quarterly dividends to stockholders, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nThe following is a summary of material contractual obligations and other commercial commitments (in millions):\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less\nthan\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term Loan (including interest currently at 1.67%) (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>329.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>306.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>239.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Open purchase obligations (2)\n</td> <td>1,021.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>802.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>199.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term obligations, including current portion (3)\n</td> <td>363.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>310.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liabilities related to uncertain income tax positions\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,963.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>931.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>903.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount of Commitment Expirations by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Commercial Commitments\n</td> <td>Total\nAmounts\nCommitted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less\nthan\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Letters of credit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________\n (1) On November"
