This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in those forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those described under Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d The tables and information in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations\u201d section were derived from exact numbers and may have immaterial rounding differences.\nOverview\nExecutive Summary\nThroughout 2017, our continuing operational strategic goals included growing revenue and expanding our operating margins by leveraging our infrastructure, focusing on higher returning assets and driving continuous improvements in efficiency. To achieve these goals, we concentrated on generating growth in our core rental business through strong organic growth. We also actively manage fleet utilization and seek to control costs.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d), which, among other things, reduces the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, and requires mandatory repatriation of foreign earnings. As a result of the Tax Act, we remeasured our net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a net tax benefit of $77.6 million. In addition, we recorded a provisional income tax expense of $3.1 million related to the repatriation of foreign earnings. We estimate that our 2018 consolidated effective tax rate will be between 24% and 26%. We do not expect a significant near-term impact on cash paid for taxes.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our network includes 121 Storage Solutions locations, 17 Tank & Pump locations and 16 combined locations. Our Storage Solutions fleet consists of approximately 215,000 units and our Tank & Pump Solutions business has a fleet of approximately 12,100 units.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, our achievements include:\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Grew total rental revenues 4.7% year-over-year, when adjusting for the unfavorable effect of currency fluctuations,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Within the Storage Solutions business, which represented approximately 82% of rental revenue in 2017:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> Grew total rental revenues 6.0% year-over-year, when adjusting for unfavorable currency fluctuations,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> Increased year-over-year Storage Solutions rental rates by 4.2%, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> Increased average units on rent by 4.6%, and year-end units on rent by 6.0%,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Successfully positioned our Tank & Pump Solutions business to take advantage of positive trends in our underlying markets, resulting in:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> Sequential rental revenue growth each quarter of 2017, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> Fourth quarter year-over-year rental revenue growth of 14.2%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Generated adjusted EBITDA of $184.8 million, with a 34.6% margin,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Achieved world-class safety results, with a North American TRIR of less than 1.0,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Implemented digital solutions across our businesses to drive market share, especially with large customers that value this deepened technology, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Generated $65.6 million in free cash flow and returned $48.5 million to shareholders through dividends and treasury share repurchases.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBusiness Environment and Outlook\nApproximately 66% of our rental revenue during the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017 was derived from our North American Storage Solutions business, 18% was derived from our Tank & Pump Solutions business in North America and 16% was derived from our U.K. Storage Solutions business. Our business is subject to the general health of the economy and we utilize a variety of general economic indicators to assess market trends and determine the direction of our business. Based on analyst growth estimates for the industries we operate in, we currently expect that the majority of our end markets will continue to drive demand for our products in 2018. In particular, construction, which represents approximately 41% of our consolidated rental revenue is forecasted for continued growth for the next several years. While only 2% of our consolidated rental revenue is generated by oil and gas customers, the oil and gas industry is forecasted to grow in 2018. In the U.K. our end markets are currently stable; however, the overall U.K. economy faces some uncertainty related to Brexit.\nAccounting and Operating Overview\nOur principal operating revenues and expenses are:\nRevenues:\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Rental revenues include all rent and ancillary revenues we receive for our rental fleet.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Sales revenues consist primarily of sales of new and used fleet and, to a lesser extent, parts and supplies sold to customers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCosts and Expenses:\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Rental, selling and general expenses include, among other expenses, payroll and payroll-related costs (including share-based compensation and commissions for our sales team), fleet transportation and fuel costs, repair and maintenance costs for our rental fleet and transportation equipment, real estate lease expense, insurance costs, and general corporate expenses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Cost of sales is the net book value of the units that were sold during the reported period and includes both our cost to buy, transport, remanufacture and modify used containers and our cost to manufacture Storage Solutions units and other structures.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation on our rental fleet, our property, plant and equipment, and amortization of definite-lived intangible assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to focusing on GAAP measurements, we focus on EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow to measure our operating results. As such, we include in this Annual Report on Form 10-K reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. We also evaluate our operations on a constant currency basis. These reconciliations and descriptions of why we believe these measures provide useful information to investors as well as a description of the limitations of these measures are included in Item 6.

In the prior year, $410.6 million, or 80.7%, related to the Storage Solutions business and $98.1 million, or 19.3%, related to the Tank & Pump Solutions business.\nRental Revenues. Storage Solutions rental revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 increased $19.4 million, or 5.0%, as compared to the prior-year period. Adjusting for an unfavorable change in currency translation rates rental revenue increased approximately 6.0%, as compared to the prior-year period. The increase was driven by a 3.1% increase in year-over-year rental rates and a 4.6% increase in units on rent. Adjusting for the unfavorable currency effect, yield (calculated as rental revenues divided by average units on rent) increased approximately 1.4% as compared to the prior-year period, driven by the rate increase in the current-year period, offset by changes in mix and other rental items. The full year rental revenue increase was impacted by strong fourth quarter year-over-year increases in seasonal business. Storage Solutions rental revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 9.8%, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, when adjusted for the impact of currency fluctuations.\nRental revenues within the Tank & Pump Solutions business decreased $0.7 million, or 0.8%, for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior-year period. Decreased year-over-year rental revenue in the first nine months of 2017 was largely offset by increased year-over-year rental revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017. Rental revenues for the first nine months of 2017 decreased $3.9 million, or 5.5% when compared to the same period in 2016, due primarily to decreased demand from our downstream customers as well as fewer infrastructure projects in our pump business. Fourth quarter 2017 rental revenue for our Tank & Pump Solutions business increased $3.2 million, or 14.2%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 due to the resumption of previously deferred maintenance in our downstream market, increased demand overall and new business. Demand from our customers is improving and we have positioned ourselves as a company to take advantage of positive trends in the underlying markets.\nSales Revenues. We focus on rental revenues. In general, sales of units from our fleet occur due to a particular customer need, or due to having fleet in excess of demand at a particular location. Storage Solutions sales revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 increased $5.4 million, or 25.1%, to $27.0 million, compared to $21.6 million in the prior-year period. The growth was largely due to increased activity in the U.K. resulting from a recent acquisition. Tank & Pump Solutions sales revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 increased $0.5 million to $5.4 million, compared to $4.9 million in the prior-year period.\nCosts and Expenses.

Rental, selling and general expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 of $336.4 million increased $27.1 million, or 8.8%, as compared to 2016. Of this total increase, $22.5 million related to the Storage Solutions business and $4.7 million related to the Tank & Pump Solutions business. As a percentage of total revenues, rental, selling and general expenses were 63.1% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, which was up from 60.8% in 2016.\nWithin the Storage Solutions business, rental, selling and general expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 increased $22.5 million, or 9.2%, from 2016. Included in Storage Solutions rental, selling and general expenses for 2017 and 2016 were $2.6 million and $0.8 million, respectively, of expenses that were not indicative of our operations, primarily costs associated with the severance and transition of executive officers.\nExcluding the expenses discussed above, rental, selling and general expenses within the Storage Solutions business increased $20.7 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the 2016 period. When further adjusted for the effect of the change in currency translation rates, rental selling and general expenses for the Storage Solutions business increased $23.3 million. This increase was driven largely by higher variable compensation in 2017, as compared to 2016. In addition, transportation costs and payroll increased due to increased rental activity.\nRental, selling and general expenses for the Tank & Pump Solutions business increased $4.7 million in 2017, as compared to 2016. The increase was largely due to increased payroll and variable compensation.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales is the cost related to our sales revenue only. Within the Storage Solutions business, cost of sales was $17.9 million and $13.3 million in the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Storage Solutions sales profit was $9.1 million and $8.3 million for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Sales profit expressed as a percentage of sales revenue (sales profit margin) was 33.6% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 38.3% in the prior-year period. The decrease in profit margin is due to sales activity related to the recent U.K. acquisition.\nWithin the Tank & Pump Solutions business, cost of sales was $3.1 million and $3.2 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Tank & Pump Solutions sales profit was $2.4 million and $1.8 million for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nRestructuring expenses. The restructuring expenses in 2017 and 2016 resulted primarily to the continuation of projects initiated in prior years. Included in restructuring expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were\napproximately $1.3 million and $2.0 million, respectively, of expenses related to the integration of our wholly owned subsidiary ETS into the existing Mobile Mini infrastructure. Also included in restructuring expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $0.9 million and $3.3 million, respectively of costs related to the divestiture of our wood mobile office business, primarily related to the abandonment of yards, or portions of yards. The remaining restructuring expenses in both years relate largely to divisional and corporate departmental restructurings. We expect to recognize less than $0.5 million in restructuring expenses related to these restructurings in 2018.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense of $63.4 million decreased slightly in the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 2016.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased $3.0 million to $35.7 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $32.7 million in the prior-year period. The 9.2% increase is primarily due to higher interest rates on the line of credit, partially offset by a decrease in the effective interest rate on our bonds due to the issuance of the 2024 Notes and extinguishment of the 2020 Notes in the second quarter of 2016.\nOur average debt outstanding in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $934.5 million, as compared to $929.1 million in the prior-year period. The weighted average interest rate on our debt was 3.6% and 3.3% for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, excluding the amortization of debt issuance costs. Taking into account the amortization of debt issuance costs, the weighted average interest rate was 3.8% and 3.5% for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nDebt Extinguishment Expense and Deferred Financing Costs Write-off. As a result of the redemption of the 2020 Notes in 2016, we recognized $9.2 million in debt extinguishment expense, consisting of $7.9 million in debt redemption premiums and $1.3 million in contractually required interest above the amount payable prior to the redemption. Additionally, we wrote off $2.3 million of previously deferred costs associated with the 2020 Notes that had not yet been amortized.\n(Benefit) Provision for Income Taxes. The effective income tax (benefit) rate of (64.9%) for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily impacted by the accounting for the U.S. Tax reform enacted on December 22, 2017 which reduced the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The company recognized a net benefit of $77.6 million related to the remeasurement of its net deferred tax liabilities for this rate change, affecting the rate by (104.7%). Additionally, the company recorded a provisional expense of $3.1 million for the mandatory repatriation of foreign earnings, affecting the rate by 4.2%. Excluding the effects of tax reform, our tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 35.6%.\nThe increase to 35.6% from the effective tax rate of 31.4% for the prior-year period is due to an enacted U.K. rate change in 2016, reducing the rate applied to deferred tax balances from 18% to 17%, which resulted in a $0.9 million benefit for the year ended December 31, 2016. Additionally, changes in foreign rate differentials contributed to the overall effective tax rate increase. The change in foreign rate differentials was caused by the utilization of all remaining U.K. net operating losses during 2017, resulting in higher tax rates on our current year U.K. income. Based on information currently available to us, we estimate that our 2018 effective tax rate will be between 24% and 26%.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately $206.4 million, which expires, if unused, from 2028 to 2034. In addition, we had net operating loss carryforwards in the various states in which we operate. Over the past three years, we have generated $122.2 million of federal taxable income and we expect to utilize the unreserved net operating loss carryforwards prior to expiration. At December 31, 2017, we had $79.8 million of gross deferred tax assets included within the net deferred tax liability on our balance sheet, and a $1.1 million valuation allowance. We believe, based on internal projections, that we will generate sufficient taxable income needed to realize the corresponding unreserved federal and state deferred tax assets to the extent they are recorded as deferred tax assets in our balance sheet. However, given that the federal net operating loss carryforwards that give rise to the deferred tax asset expire over seven years beginning in 2028, there could be changes in management's judgment in future periods with respect to the recoverability of these assets. See Note 7 Income Taxes\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion on income taxes.\nNet Income. As a result of the income statement activity discussed above, we had net income of $122.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Excluding the effect of the tax legislation, we estimate our net income would have been approximately $47.7 million, as compared to $47.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA. For the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017, we realized adjusted EBITDA of $184.8 million, a decrease of $5.6 million, or 2.9%, as compared to adjusted EBITDA of $190.4 million in 2016. Growth in our\nStorage Solutions business revenue was offset by a decrease in the Tank & Pump Solutions business, overall increased rental, selling and general costs primarily driven by increased variable compensation in the current-year period and an unfavorable currency exchange rate. Our adjusted EBITDA margins were 34.6% and 37.4 % for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, adjusted EBITDA related to the Storage Solutions business decreased $1.0 million, or 0.6%, to $158.0 million, from $159.0 million in the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA related to the Tank & Pump Solutions business decreased $4.5 million, or 14.5%, to $26.8 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, from $31.4 million during 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were 36.3% for the Storage Solutions business and 27.4% for the Tank & Pump Solutions business.\nThe full-year adjusted EBITDA was favorably impacted by a strong fourth quarter in which we realized adjusted EBITDA of $55.6 million, an increase of $1.5 million, or 2.7%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenue growth due to increased Tank & Pump Solutions business, and robust growth in our seasonal Storage Solutions revenues, while largely offset by increased variable compensation and other rental, selling and general expense increases, resulted in overall adjusted EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter.\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2016, Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2015\nThe

In 2015, $423.5 million, or 79.8%, related to the Storage Solutions business and $107.3 million, or 20.2%, related to the Tank & Pump Solutions business. The wood mobile office business divested in May 2015 contributed approximately $16.9 million of total revenue and $15.8 million of rental revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nRental Revenues. Storage Solutions rental revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 increased $7.8 million, or 2.1%, as compared to 2015, excluding the effect of the wood mobile office fleet divestiture discussed above. Adjusting for an unfavorable change in currency translation rates and excluding the divested wood mobile office assets, rental revenue increased approximately 4.7% in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase was driven by a 2.3% increase in year-over-year rental rates and a 1.9% increase in units on rent. Excluding the divested wood mobile office fleet and adjusting for the unfavorable currency effect, yield in 2016 increased approximately 2.7% as compared to 2015, largely driven by the rate increase in 2016. The 4.7% rental revenue growth was achieved despite challenges related to turnover in our North American sales force, which we actively addressed through revised hiring processes, incremental sales management and focused training.\nRental revenues within the Tank & Pump Solutions business decreased $6.7 million, or 6.7%, for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015. This decline was primarily driven by decreases in upstream revenues due to challenges in the oil and gas sector, as well as a decrease in our diversified business caused by weakness in the mining sector and fewer infrastructure projects. Revenues in the downstream market increased slightly in 2016, as compared to 2015. High-capacity production resulting from lower oil prices has caused the postponement of maintenance projects in that sector.\nSales Revenues. We focus on rental revenues. In general, sales of units from our fleet occur due to a particular customer need, or due to having fleet in excess of demand at a particular location. Storage Solutions sales revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 decreased $0.8 million, or 3.6%, to $21.6 million, compared to $22.4 million in the 2015. Tank & Pump Solutions sales revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 decreased $2.6 million to $4.9 million, compared to $7.6 million in 2015.\nCosts and Expenses.

Rental, selling and general expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 of $309.3 million decreased $17.0 million, or 5.2%, as compared to the prior-year period. This net decrease resulted from an $18.2 million reduction related to the Storage Solutions business, offset by a $1.3 million increase related to the Tank & Pump Solutions business. As a percentage of total revenues, rental, selling and general expenses were 60.8% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, which was down from 61.5% in 2015.\nWithin the Storage Solutions business, rental, selling and general expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 decreased $18.2 million, or 6.9%, from 2015. Included in the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $0.8 million and $7.9 million, respectively, of expenses that were not indicative of our operations. In 2016, the expenses were associated with the departure of an executive officer, a sales tax remittance and acquisition-related expenses. The rental, selling and general expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 included $2.6 million in acquisition-related expenses, $4.4 million of transition service expenses and $0.9 million of expenses related to an unclaimed property settlement.\nExcluding the expenses discussed above, rental, selling and general expenses within the Storage Solutions business decreased $11.2 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015. This decrease in Storage Solutions business rental, selling and general expenses was driven largely by fluctuations in currency translation rates, decreased variable compensation, including stock-based compensation, as well as lower fleet freight and fuel costs resulting from decreased activity due to the divestiture of our wood mobile office fleet, as well as lower fuel prices generally. Salaries and wages and other operating costs within the Storage Solutions business increased due to the expansion of shared services, as well as the implementation and operation of our new ERP system; however, these increases were largely offset by increased allocations of overhead expenses to the Tank & Pump Solutions business as we continue to consolidate our infrastructure and shared services.\nRental, selling and general expenses for the Tank & Pump Solutions business increased $1.3 million in 2016, as compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to increased allocations of overhead expenses to the Tank & Pump Solutions business, partially offset by decreases in salaries and wages and other operating costs. In 2016, the consolidation of our infrastructure and shared services resulted in the elimination of redundant employee positions. In addition, lower fleet freight and fuel costs resulted from decreased rental activity.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales is the cost related to our sales revenue only. Within the Storage Solutions business, cost of sales was $13.3 million and $14.6 million in the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nStorage Solutions sales profit was $8.3 million and $7.8 million for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Sales profit margin was 38.3% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 34.9% in 2015.\nWithin the Tank & Pump Solutions business, cost of sales was $3.2 million and $5.1 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Tank & Pump Solutions sales profit was $1.8 million and $2.5 million for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nRestructuring expenses. The restructuring expenses in 2016 resulted primarily to the continuation of projects initiated in prior years.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, $2.0 million and $19.7 million, respectively, related to activities associated with the integration of ETS into the existing Mobile Mini infrastructure, including the re-alignment of sales leadership with operational leadership.\nIntegration includes such activities as:\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Combining Storage Solutions and Tank & Pump locations in markets where both lines of business are present,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Expanding either line of business to new geographies where we maintain a presence in the other,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Eliminating duplicative or redundant positions at both the corporate level and in operations, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Determining the appropriate processes, including the alignment of sales leadership with operational leadership, and eliminating infrastructure that does not function optimally in the new environment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAlso included in restructuring expense were costs to shift our business away from the wood mobile office business, including abandonment of yards, totaling approximately $3.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOf the total $6.0 million of restructuring expense recognized in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, approximately $0.4 million was non-cash. Of the total $20.8 million of restructuring expense recognized in the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, approximately $17.0 million was non-cash.\nAsset Impairment Charge and Loss on Divestiture, Net. The $66.1 million net asset impairment charge and loss on divestiture for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was due to the impairment and sale of our wood mobile office fleet in our North American portable storage segment. See additional discussion regarding the impairment of the wood mobile office assets in Note 4 Impairment and Divestiture of North American Wood Mobile Offices\u201d to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $3.4 million in the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015. This increase was due primarily to increased depreciation expense related to property, plant and equipment, including the implementation of our new ERP system. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in depreciation expense related to the wood mobile office units divested in May 2015. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $1.3 million of depreciation expense related to these units.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense decreased $3.2 million, or 8.8%, to $32.7 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, compared to $35.9 million in 2015. Our average debt outstanding in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $929.1 million, as compared to $902.9 million in the prior-year period. The weighted average interest rate on our debt was 3.3% and 3.6% for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, excluding the amortization of debt issuance costs. Taking into account the amortization of debt issuance costs, the weighted average interest rate was 3.5% and 4.0% for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThe decrease in the effective interest rate was due to the issuance of the 2024 Notes and extinguishment of the 2020 Notes in the second quarter of 2016, along with the refinancing of our line of credit in the fourth quarter of 2015. Each of these activities resulted in lowered interest rates. See additional discussion in Note 6 Debt\u201d to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.\nDebt Extinguishment Expense and Deferred Financing Costs Write-off. As a result of the redemption of the 2020 Notes during 2016, we recognized $9.2 million in debt extinguishment expense, consisting of $7.9 million in debt redemption\npremiums and $1.3 million in contractually required interest above the amount payable prior to the redemption. Additionally, we wrote off $2.3 million of previously deferred costs associated with the 2020 Notes that had not yet been amortized.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we had a $21.7 million provision for income taxes, compared to a net benefit of $4.8 million in 2015. Our effective income tax rate was 31.4% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Our 2016 income tax was affected by an enacted tax rate change in the U.K. reducing the tax rate from 18% to 17% and deductions for stock compensation. Our 2015 income tax was affected similarly by an enacted rate change in the U.K. income tax rate reducing the tax rate from 20% to 18%, as well as losses in North America driven by the asset impairment and restructuring expenses as discussed previously in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The change in the U.K. income tax rate resulted in a $0.9 million benefit and $1.4 million benefit for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nExcluding the North America asset impairment and the $1.4 million cumulative effect on 2015 deferred liabilities of the U.K. rate change, our tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 33.4%. The decrease from 33.4% to 31.4% resulted primarily from the enacted tax rate change in the U.K. as discussed above and certain stock compensation deductions.\nNet Income. As a result of the income statement activity discussed above, we had net income of $47.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $5.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.\nAdjusted EBITDA. For the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2016, we realized adjusted EBITDA of $190.4 million, a decrease of $10.5 million, or 5.2%, as compared to adjusted EBITDA of $200.8 million in the prior-year period. Growth in our Storage Solutions business was offset by short-term pressure resulting from the divestiture of our wood mobile office fleet, unfavorable currency fluctuations of $4.0 million, increased repairs and maintenance expense, and increased operating costs related to our recently implemented ERP system, as well as the year-over-year decline in Tank & Pump Solutions rental revenue. Our adjusted EBITDA margins were 37.4% and 38.1% for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, adjusted EBITDA related to the Storage Solutions business decreased $1.7 million, or 1.1%, to $159.0 million, from $160.7 million in 2015. Adjusted EBITDA related to the Tank & Pump Solutions business decreased $8.8 million, or 21.8%, to $31.4 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, from $40.2 million in 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 were 38.7% for the Storage Solutions business and 32.0% for the Tank & Pump Solutions business.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nRenting is a capital-intensive business that requires us to acquire assets before they generate revenues, cash flow and earnings. The majority of the assets that we rent have very long useful lives and require relatively little maintenance expenditures. Most of the capital we have deployed in our rental business historically has been used to expand our operations geographically, to execute opportunistic acquisitions, to increase the number of units available for rent at our existing locations, and to add to the mix of products we offer. During recent years, our operations have generated annual cash flow that exceeds our pre-tax earnings, particularly due to cash flow from operations and the deferral of income taxes caused by accelerated depreciation of our fixed assets in our tax return filings. Our strong cash from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 of $135.6 million, $136.2 million and $152.8 million, respectively, resulted in free cash flow of $65.6 million, $64.7 million and $73.6 million, respectively. In addition to free cash flow, our principal current source of liquidity is the Credit Agreement described below.\nRevolving Credit Facility. On December 14, 2015, we entered into the Credit Agreement with Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, as administrative agent, and other lenders party thereto. The Credit Agreement provides for a five-year, $1.0 billion first lien senior secured revolving credit facility maturing on or before the earlier of (i) December 14, 2020 and (ii) the date that is 90 days prior to the final maturity date of the Senior Notes if such Senior Notes remain outstanding on such date. The Credit Agreement also provides for the issuance of irrevocable standby letters of credit by U.S. lenders in amounts totaling up to $50.0 million, by U.K.-based lenders in amounts totaling up to $20.0 million, and by Canadian-based lenders in amounts totaling up to $20.0 million.\nThe obligations of us and our subsidiary guarantors under the Credit Agreement are secured by a blanket lien on substantially all of our assets. At December 31, 2017, we had $634.3 million of borrowings outstanding and $361.4 million of additional borrowing availability under the Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with the terms of the Credit\nAgreement as of December 31, 2017 and were above the minimum borrowing availability threshold and therefore not subject to any financial maintenance covenants.\nAmounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement and repaid or prepaid during the term may be reborrowed. Outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement bear interest at our option at either: (i) the London interbank offered rate ( LIBOR\u201d) plus an applicable margin ( LIBOR Loans\u201d), or (ii) the prime rate plus an applicable margin ( Base Rate Loans\u201d). The applicable margin for each type of loan is based on an availability-based pricing grid and ranges from 1.25% to 1.75% for LIBOR Loans and 0.25% to 0.75% for Base Rate Loans at each measurement date. The margins in effect as of December 31, 2017 are 1.50% for LIBOR Loans and 0.50% for Base Rate Loans.\nAvailability of borrowings under the Credit Agreement is subject to a borrowing base calculation based upon a valuation of our eligible accounts receivable, eligible rental fleet (including units held for sale, work-in-process and raw materials) and machinery and equipment, each multiplied by an applicable advance rate or limit. The rental fleet is appraised at least once annually by a third-party appraisal firm and up to 90% of the net orderly liquidation value, as defined in the Credit Agreement, is included in the borrowing base to determine how much we may borrow under the Credit Agreement.\nThe Credit Agreement provides for U.K. borrowings, which are, at our option, denominated in either Pounds Sterling or Euros, by our U.K. subsidiary based upon a U.K. borrowing base; Canadian borrowings, which are denominated in Canadian dollars, by our Canadian subsidiary based upon a Canadian borrowing base; and U.S. borrowings, which are denominated in U.S. dollars, based upon a U.S. borrowing base along with any Canadian assets not included in the Canadian subsidiary.\nThe Credit Agreement also contains customary negative covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things: (i) allow certain liens to attach to Mobile Mini or subsidiary assets, (ii) repurchase or pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments on capital stock and certain other securities, or prepay certain indebtedness, (iii) incur additional indebtedness or engage in certain other types of financing transactions, and (iv) make acquisitions or other investments. In addition, we must comply with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each quarter, upon the minimum availability amount under the Credit Agreement falling below the greater of (y) $90 million and (z) 10% of the lesser of the then total revolving loan commitment and aggregate borrowing base.\nWe believe our cash provided by operating activities will provide for our normal capital needs for the next twelve months. If not, we have sufficient borrowings available under our Credit Agreement to meet any additional funding requirements. We monitor the financial strength of our lenders on an ongoing basis using publicly-available information. Based upon that information, we do not presently believe that there is a likelihood that any of our lenders will be unable to honor their respective commitments under the Credit Agreement.\nSenior Notes. On May 9, 2016, we issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes at an initial offering price of 100% of their face value. The net proceeds from the sale of the 2024 Notes were used to (i) redeem all $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 2020 Notes at a redemption price of 103.938% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date of June 8, 2016, (ii) repay a portion of the indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Agreement, and (iii) pay fees and expenses related to the offering of the 2024 Notes.\nThe 2024 Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.875% per year, accruing from May 9, 2016, have an eight-year term and mature on July 1, 2024. Interest on the 2024 Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on January 1 and July 1, beginning on January 1, 2017. The 2024 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain of our existing and future domestic subsidiaries.\nCash Flow Summary\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 122,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 47,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt extinguishment expense and deferred financing costs write-off\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset impairment charge and loss on divestiture, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 66,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash restructuring expense, excluding share-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (49,980\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,629\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 76,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by\noperating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 108,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 150,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in certain assets and liabilities, net of effect of businesses acquired\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,459\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (19,077\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,331\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 135,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 136,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 152,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (70,006\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (88,153\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14,415\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (57,043\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (44,853\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (140,576\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of exchange rate changes on cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (714\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,126\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $135.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $136.2 million in the prior year, a slight decrease. The twelve months ended December 31, 2017 reflects an increase in net income of $75.0 million. Non-cash adjustments in 2017 total $22.9 million as compared to $108.1 million in 2016. This fluctuation is primarily a result of the Tax Act in 2017 and debt extinguishment costs in 2016. The change in working capital accounts resulted in cash outflows of $9.5 million in 2017 and $19.1 million in 2016. The $8.9 million decrease in cash outflows is largely due to increases in accounts receivable during 2016 due to the implementation of our new ERP system, as well as changes in the invoicing process instituted by our largest Storage Solutions customer.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $136.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, compared to $152.8 million in 2015, a decrease of $16.6 million. The twelve months ended December 31, 2016 reflects an increase in net income to $47.2 million, from net income of $5.6 million in 2015. Non-cash adjustments in 2016 totaled $108.1 million as compared to $150.6 million in 2015. In 2016 and 2015 non-cash adjustments included debt extinguishment costs and 2015 non-cash adjustments also included impairment and restructuring charges. The change in working capital accounts resulted in cash outflows of $19.1 million in the 2016 period and $3.3 million in the 2015 period. The $15.7 million decrease in cash outflows was largely due to the temporary increase in receivables at December 31, 2016. This outflow was partially offset by an increase in accrued liabilities primarily due to the timing of interest payments related to the 2024 Notes. Interest payments on the 2024 Notes are payable in January and June, as compared to the 2020 Notes for which interest payments were payable in June and December.\nCash provided by operating activities is enhanced by the deferral of most income taxes due to the rapid tax depreciation rate of our assets and our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards. At December 31, 2017, we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately $206.4 million and a net deferred tax liability of $173.8 million.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $70.0 million in 2017, compared to $88.2 million in 2016 and $14.4 million in 2015. In 2016 and 2015, we paid $16.6 million and $18.5 million, respectively, for acquisitions. Also included in investing activities for 2015 is $83.3 million of proceeds related to the divestiture of our wood mobile office business. Rental fleet expenditures were as follows for the periods indicated:\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Additions to Rental Fleet, Excluding Acquisitions\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> North America Storage Solutions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> United Kingdom Storage Solutions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,405\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tank & Pump Solutions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated additions to rental fleet, excluding acquisitions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proceeds from sale of rental fleet\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12,953\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13,679\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16,865\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rental fleet net capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 43,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 57,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRental fleet expenditures were $63.7 million in 2017, an increase of 11.0% compared to 2016, and decreased 23.2% in 2016 as compared to 2015. Expenditures for rental fleet were made to meet demand in geographic areas of high utilization for which it did not make economic sense to reposition our fleet, as well as to meet customer demand for specific types of units. Proceeds from sale of rental fleet units decreased 5.3% in 2017, compared to 2016, and decreased 18.9% in 2016, compared to 2015. In general, sales of units from our fleet occur due to a particular customer need, or due to having fleet in excess of demand at a particular location; as such, the proceeds from sale of rental units will normally fluctuate from year to year.\nProperty, plant and equipment net capital expenditures were $19.3 million in 2017, $27.9 million in 2016 and $21.3 million in 2015. Included in 2016 and 2015 are $14.9 million and $17.9 million, respectively, of computer hardware and software expenditures largely related to our new ERP system. The 2017 expenditures and remaining 2016 and 2015 expenditures for property, plant and equipment were primarily for replacement of our transportation equipment. Included in the $9.9 million of proceeds from sale of property plant and equipment for 2015 is $6.8 million of proceeds received in conjunction with the sale of a legacy location in Southern California, which was disposed of in conjunction with restructuring activity.\nThe amount of cash that we use during any period in investing activities is almost entirely within management's discretion. We have no contracts or other arrangements pursuant to which we are required to purchase a fixed or minimum amount of goods or services in connection with any portion of our business. Capital expenditures includes expenses such as the cost to buy or replace forklifts, trucks and trailers that we use to move and deliver our products to our customers, and for our computer information and communication systems. In addition to the cash expenditures, we acquired property, plant and equipment through capital leases totaling $9.5 million, $19.0 million and $17.6 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These leases were primarily for transportation related equipment.\nWe anticipate our near term investing activities in 2018 will be similar to 2017 and will be primarily focused on supporting growth in the U.K. and Tank & Pump Solutions business, additional Storage Solutions rental fleet through remanufacturing, and transportation equipment. In addition, we may invest in opportunistic acquisitions.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $57.0 million in 2017, $44.9 million in 2016 and $140.6 million in 2015. Activity in 2016 includes the issuance of $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes at an initial offering price of 100% of their face value. The net proceeds from the sale of the 2024 Notes were used to (i) redeem all $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 2020 Notes at a redemption price of 103.938% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date of June 8, 2016, (ii) repay a portion of the indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Agreement, and (iii) pay fees and expenses related to the offering of the 2024 Notes.\nWe have used free cash flow, along with proceeds from our wood mobile office divestiture, to purchase treasury stock, pay down borrowings and pay dividends. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, we paid cash dividends of $40.2 million, $36.4 million and $33.7 million, respectively, to our stockholders and purchased shares of our common stock of $8.4 million, $11.3 million and $61.8 million (primarily under our share repurchase program), respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had $634.3 million of borrowings outstanding under our Credit Agreement and approximately $361.4 million of additional borrowings were available to us. Deferred financing cost expenditures in 2016 largely relate to the issuance of the 2024 Notes. Deferred financing costs in 2015 primarily relate to the Credit Agreement.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nOur contractual obligations primarily consist of our outstanding balance under the Credit Agreement, $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes and obligations under capital leases. We also have operating lease commitments for: (i) real estate properties for the majority of our locations with remaining lease terms typically ranging from one to ten years (ii) delivery, transportation and yard equipment, typically under a five-year lease with purchase options at the end of the lease term at a stated or fair market value price, and (iii) office related equipment. At December 31, 2017, primarily in connection with securing our insurance policies, we provided certain insurance carriers and others with approximately $4.3 million in letters of credit. We currently do not have any obligations under purchase agreements or commitments.\nThe table below provides a summary of our contractual commitments as of December 31, 2017. Lease renewal options that we currently anticipate exercising at the end of the initial lease period have been included in the schedule below.\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less Than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 634,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 634,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payment obligations under our revolving credit\nfacility (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,783\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payment obligations under our Senior Notes (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 95,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Obligations under capital leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payment obligations under our capital leases (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 89,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,181,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 60,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 747,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 305,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Scheduled interest rate obligations under our Credit Agreement, which is subject to a variable rate of interest, were calculated using our weighted average rate as of December 31, 2017 of 3.0%.

Construction customers typically reflect higher demand during months with more temperate weather, while demand for our portable storage units by large retailers is stronger from September through December because these retailers need to store more inventories for the holiday season. Our retail customers usually return these rented units to us in December and early in the following year. In the Tank & Pump Solutions business, demand from customers is typically higher in the middle of the year from March to October, driven by the timing of customer maintenance projects. The demand for rental of our pumps may also be impacted by weather, specifically when temperatures drop below freezing.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments\nOur significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, some of which require significant judgment.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions are based upon expert information, our evaluation of historical results and anticipated future events, and these estimates may change as additional information becomes available. We have identified below our accounting policies that we believe could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying estimates or assumptions.\nRevenue Recognition. Rental revenue is generated from the direct rental of our fleet to our customers, including ancillary revenue such as fleet delivery and pickup. We enter into contracts with our customers to rent equipment based on a monthly rate for our Storage Solutions fleet and a daily, weekly or monthly rate for our Tank & Pump Solutions fleet. Revenues from renting are recognized ratably over the rental period. The rental continues until cancelled by the customer or\nthe Company. Customers may utilize our equipment delivery and pick-up services in conjunction with the rental of equipment, but it is not required. Revenue pursuant to the pick up or delivery of a rented unit is recognized in rental revenue upon completion of the service. When customers are billed in advance, we defer recognition of revenue and record unearned rental revenue at the end of the period. If equipment is returned prior to the end of the contractually obligated period, the excess, if any, between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay, over the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date, is recognized as incremental revenue upon return.\nSales revenue is primarily generated by the sale of new and used units, and to a lesser extent, parts and supplies sold to Tank & Pump Solutions customers. We recognize revenues from sales of units upon delivery when the risk of loss passes, the price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We sell our units pursuant to sales contracts stating the fixed sales price.\nPurchase Accounting. We account for acquisitions under the acquisition method. Under the acquisition method of accounting, we record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair market value on the date of acquisition. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable net assets. Estimated fair values of acquired assets and liabilities is provisional and could change as additional information is received. We finalize valuations as soon as practicable, but not later than one-year from the acquisition date. Any subsequent changes to purchase price allocations results in a corresponding adjustment to goodwill.\nThe determination of the fair value of intangible assets requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if amortizable, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. We estimate the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition.\nGoodwill. For acquired businesses, we record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the respective acquisition dates. Based on these values, the excess purchase prices over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Of the $708.9 million total goodwill at December 31, 2017, $468.8 million related to the North American Storage Solutions segment, $58.9 million related to the U.K. Storage Solutions segment and $181.2 million related to the Tank & Pump Solutions segment.\nGoodwill impairment testing requires judgment, including: the identification of the reporting units; determination of the fair value of each reporting unit; the assignment of assets, liabilities and goodwill to each reporting unit; estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows and discount rates; and an assumption regarding the form of the transaction in which the reporting unit would be acquired by a market participant. Management assesses potential impairment of goodwill on an annual basis at December 31, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nSome factors management considers important which could indicate an impairment review include the following:\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> significant under-performance relative to historical, expected or projected future operating results;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> market capitalization relative to net book value; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> significant negative industry or general economic trends.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement may choose to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that goodwill might be impaired and whether or not to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. When the two-step impairment test is performed, the first step requires a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting unit's net assets to the respective carrying value of net assets. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's net assets is less than its fair value, no indication of impairment exists and a second step is not performed. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit's net assets is higher than its fair value, there is an indication that an impairment may exist and a second step must be performed. If the second step is necessary, management is required to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the goodwill. The fair value of the reporting units would be assigned to the respective assets and liabilities of each reporting unit as if the reporting units had been acquired in separate and individual business combinations and the fair value of the reporting units was the price paid to acquire the reporting units. The excess of the fair value of the reporting units over the amounts assigned to their respective assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill, an impairment loss must be recognized for the difference.\nWhen assessing the fair value of the reporting units under the two-step impairment test, management considers both the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is based on quoted market prices of companies comparable to the reporting unit being valued. Under the income approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated cash flows. The income approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions, including estimated future revenue growth rates and discount rates. Other estimates relate to tax payments, operating margins and capital expenditures. Each approach is given equal weight in arriving at the fair value of the reporting unit.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we assessed qualitative factors and determined it is more likely than not each of the reporting unit's assigned goodwill had estimated fair values greater than the respective reporting unit's individual net asset carrying values; therefore, the two step impairment test was not performed.\nIn connection with our goodwill impairment test that was conducted as of December 31, 2015, we chose to perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units. Our goodwill impairment testing as of this date indicated that both of our Storage Solutions reporting units and our Tank & Pump Solutions reporting unit had estimated fair values which substantially exceeded their respective carrying amounts. The second step of the impairment test was not required for any of the reporting units.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets (Other than Goodwill). Our rental fleet, property, plant and equipment, and finite-lived intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may be impaired. (See potential impairment indicators under Goodwill\u201d above.) If this review indicates the carrying value of these assets will not be recoverable, as measured based on estimated undiscounted cash flows over their remaining life, the carrying amount would be adjusted to fair value. The cash flow estimates contain management's best estimates using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time of evaluation.\nDuring the first quarter of 2015, we entered into discussions regarding the possible sale of our wood mobile offices within our North American portable storage segment. The discussions indicated that the wood mobile offices might be sold at an amount below carrying value and we conducted a review for impairment for these long-lived assets as of March 31, 2015. Based on this review, an impairment loss was recorded in the quarter ended March 31, 2015. The total impairment of the wood mobile offices was $64.6 million during 2015. See additional discussion regarding the impairment and the divestiture of the wood mobile offices in Note 4 Impairment and Divestiture of North American Wood Mobile Offices\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nThere were no indicators of impairment at December 31, 2017 or December 31, 2016.\nRental Fleet. Rental fleet is capitalized at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the unit using the straight-line method. Rental fleet is depreciated whether or not it is out on rent. Capitalized cost of our rental fleet includes the price paid to acquire the unit and freight charges to the location when the unit is first placed in service, and when applicable, the cost of our manufacturing or remanufacturing, which includes the cost of customizing units. Ordinary repair and maintenance costs are charged to operations as incurred.\nWe periodically review depreciable lives and residual values against various factors, including the results of our lenders' independent appraisal of our rental fleet, practices of our competitors in comparable industries and profit margins achieved on sales of depreciated units.\nThe table below depicts the estimated useful lives and residual values (presented as a percentage of capitalized cost) for our major categories of Storage Solutions rental fleet.\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Residual\nValue as\nPercentage of\nOriginal Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Useful Life\nin Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Storage Solutions:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Steel storage containers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Steel ground level offices\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below depicts the estimated useful lives for our major categories of Tank & Pump Solutions rental fleet when purchased new. We estimate zero residual value for our Tank & Pump Solutions fleet as there is a limited secondary market for Tank & Pump Solutions products.\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Useful Life\nin Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tank & Pump Solutions:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Steel tanks\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Roll-off boxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15 - 20\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Vacuum boxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stainless steel tank trailers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> De-watering boxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pumps and filtration equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe estimated useful lives and residual values of our rental fleet might change in the future based on changing circumstances. If these estimates change in the future, we may be required to recognize increased or decreased depreciation expense for these assets. For instance, if all our rental fleet units had been placed in service with useful lives 25% less or greater than our current estimated useful lives, we estimate that our annual depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 would have been $10.4 million higher or $6.2 million lower, respectively.\nSimilarly, if our rental fleet units had been placed in service with estimated residual values decreased by 10% of the original cost, for example from 55% to 45% (with Tank & Pump Solutions residual values remaining at 0%), depreciation expense would have been approximately $3.4 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2017. If our rental fleet units had been placed in service with estimated residual values increased by 10% of the original cost, for example, from 55% to 65% for steel storage containers and from 0% to 10% for Tank & Pump Solutions, our depreciation expense would have been lower by approximately $5.0 million, for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nIncome Taxes. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we recognize income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. For each jurisdiction, we estimate the actual amount of taxes currently payable or receivable as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nA valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related benefits will not be realized. In determining the amount of the valuation allowance, we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction. If we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets, we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense. Conversely, if we determine that we will ultimately be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided, all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced with a credit to income tax expense.\nThe majority of our deferred tax asset relates to federal net operating loss carryforwards that have future expiration dates. Management believes that adequate future taxable income will be generated through future operations, or through available tax planning strategies to recover the unreserved portion of these assets. However, given that the federal net operating loss carryforwards that give rise to the deferred tax asset expire over 7 years beginning in 2028, there could be changes in management's judgment in future periods with respect to the recoverability of these assets.\nTax regulations within the various jurisdictions within which we operate are subject to interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and require the application of significant judgment. Our income taxes are subject to examination by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. There may be differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of income.\nWe have recorded certain income tax effects for the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) which was enacted on December 22, 2017 in those situations where we have all information necessary. Additionally, we have recorded a provisional effect where we could reasonably estimate the effect of the Tax Act.

operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in those forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those described under Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d The tables and information in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations\u201d section were derived from exact numbers and may have immaterial rounding differences.\nOverview\nExecutive Summary\nThroughout 2017, our continuing operational strategic goals included growing revenue and expanding our operating margins by leveraging our infrastructure, focusing on higher returning assets and driving continuous improvements in efficiency. To achieve these goals, we concentrated on generating growth in our core rental business through strong organic growth. We also actively manage fleet utilization and seek to control costs.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d), which, among other things, reduces the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, and requires mandatory repatriation of foreign earnings. As a result of the Tax Act, we remeasured our net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a net tax benefit of $77.6 million. In addition, we recorded a provisional income tax expense of $3.1 million related to the repatriation of foreign earnings. We estimate that our 2018 consolidated effective tax rate will be between 24% and 26%. We do not expect a significant near-term impact on cash paid for taxes.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our network includes 121 Storage Solutions locations, 17 Tank & Pump locations and 16 combined locations. Our Storage Solutions fleet consists of approximately 215,000 units and our Tank & Pump Solutions business has a fleet of approximately 12,100 units.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, our achievements include:\n \u2022 Grew total rental revenues 4.7% year-over-year, when adjusting for the unfavorable effect of currency fluctuations, \n \u2022 Within the Storage Solutions business, which represented approximately 82% of rental revenue in 2017: \n - Grew total rental revenues 6.0% year-over-year, when adjusting for unfavorable currency fluctuations, \n - Increased year-over-year Storage Solutions rental rates by 4.2%, and \n - Increased average units on rent by 4.6%, and year-end units on rent by 6.0%, \n \u2022 Successfully positioned our Tank & Pump Solutions business to take advantage of positive trends in our underlying markets, resulting in: \n - Sequential rental revenue growth each quarter of 2017, and \n - Fourth quarter year-over-year rental revenue growth of 14.2% \n \u2022 Generated adjusted EBITDA of $184.8 million, with a 34.6% margin, \n \u2022 Achieved world-class safety results, with a North American TRIR of less than 1.0, \n \u2022 Implemented digital solutions across our businesses to drive market share, especially with large customers that value this deepened technology, and \n \u2022 Generated $65.6 million in free cash flow and returned $48.5 million to shareholders through dividends and treasury share repurchases. \nBusiness Environment and Outlook\nApproximately 66% of our rental revenue during the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017 was derived from our North American Storage Solutions business, 18% was derived from our Tank & Pump Solutions business in North America and 16% was derived from our U.K. Storage Solutions business. Our business is subject to the general health of the economy and we utilize a variety of general economic indicators to assess market trends and determine the direction of our business. Based on analyst growth estimates for the industries we operate in, we currently expect that the majority of our end markets will continue to drive demand for our products in 2018. In particular, construction, which represents approximately 41% of our consolidated rental revenue is forecasted for continued growth for the next several years. While only 2% of our consolidated rental revenue is generated by oil and gas customers, the oil and gas industry is forecasted to grow in 2018. In the U.K. our end markets are currently stable; however, the overall U.K. economy faces some uncertainty related to Brexit.\nAccounting and Operating Overview\nOur principal operating revenues and expenses are:\nRevenues:\n \u2022 Rental revenues include all rent and ancillary revenues we receive for our rental fleet. \n \u2022 Sales revenues consist primarily of sales of new and used fleet and, to a lesser extent, parts and supplies sold to customers. \nCosts and Expenses:\n \u2022 Rental, selling and general expenses include, among other expenses, payroll and payroll-related costs (including share-based compensation and commissions for our sales team), fleet transportation and fuel costs, repair and maintenance costs for our rental fleet and transportation equipment, real estate lease expense, insurance costs, and general corporate expenses. \n \u2022 Cost of sales is the net book value of the units that were sold during the reported period and includes both our cost to buy, transport, remanufacture and modify used containers and our cost to manufacture Storage Solutions units and other structures. \n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation on our rental fleet, our property, plant and equipment, and amortization of definite-lived intangible assets. \nIn addition to focusing on GAAP measurements, we focus on EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow to measure our operating results. As such, we include in this Annual Report on Form 10-K reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. We also evaluate our operations on a constant currency basis. These reconciliations and descriptions of why we believe these measures provide useful information to investors as well as a description of the limitations of these measures are included in Item 6. Selected Financial Data.\u201d\nResults of Operations\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2017, Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2016\nThe following table sets forth for each of the periods indicated our statements of operations data and expresses revenue and expense data as percentage of total revenues for the periods presented:\n\n\n (1) See Non-GAAP Data and Reconciliations\u201d earlier in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n (2) The calculation of adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue includes a net reduction to revenues related to transactions not indicative of our business. See Non-GAAP Data and Reconciliations\u201d earlier in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nThe following table sets forth certain financial information as calculated on a constant currency basis:\n\n (1) See Non-GAAP Data and Reconciliations\u201d earlier in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nTotal Revenues. The following tables depict revenue by type of business for the twelve-month periods ended December 31:\n\n\nOf the $533.5 million of total revenues in 2017, $435.5 million, or 81.6%, related to the Storage Solutions business and $98.1 million, or 18.4%, related to the Tank & Pump Solutions business. In the prior year, $410.6 million, or 80.7%, related to the Storage Solutions business and $98.1 million, or 19.3%, related to the Tank & Pump Solutions business.\nRental Revenues. Storage Solutions rental revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 increased $19.4 million, or 5.0%, as compared to the prior-year period. Adjusting for an unfavorable change in currency translation rates rental revenue increased approximately 6.0%, as compared to the prior-year period. The increase was driven by a 3.1% increase in year-over-year rental rates and a 4.6% increase in units on rent. Adjusting for the unfavorable currency effect, yield (calculated as rental revenues divided by average units on rent) increased approximately 1.4% as compared to the prior-year period, driven by the rate increase in the current-year period, offset by changes in mix and other rental items. The full year rental revenue increase was impacted by strong fourth quarter year-over-year increases in seasonal business. Storage Solutions rental revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 9.8%, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, when adjusted for the impact of currency fluctuations.\nRental revenues within the Tank & Pump Solutions business decreased $0.7 million, or 0.8%, for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior-year period. Decreased year-over-year rental revenue in the first nine months of 2017 was largely offset by increased year-over-year rental revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017. Rental revenues for the first nine months of 2017 decreased $3.9 million, or 5.5% when compared to the same period in 2016, due primarily to decreased demand from our downstream customers as well as fewer infrastructure projects in our pump business. Fourth quarter 2017 rental revenue for our Tank & Pump Solutions business increased $3.2 million, or 14.2%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 due to the resumption of previously deferred maintenance in our downstream market, increased demand overall and new business. Demand from our customers is improving and we have positioned ourselves as a company to take advantage of positive trends in the underlying markets.\nSales Revenues. We focus on rental revenues. In general, sales of units from our fleet occur due to a particular customer need, or due to having fleet in excess of demand at a particular location. Storage Solutions sales revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 increased $5.4 million, or 25.1%, to $27.0 million, compared to $21.6 million in the prior-year period. The growth was largely due to increased activity in the U.K. resulting from a recent acquisition. Tank & Pump Solutions sales revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 increased $0.5 million to $5.4 million, compared to $4.9 million in the prior-year period.\nCosts and Expenses. The following tables depict costs and expenses by type of business for the twelve-month periods ended December 31:\n\n\nRental, Selling and General Expenses. Rental, selling and general expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 of $336.4 million increased $27.1 million, or 8.8%, as compared to 2016. Of this total increase, $22.5 million related to the Storage Solutions business and $4.7 million related to the Tank & Pump Solutions business. As a percentage of total revenues, rental, selling and general expenses were 63.1% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, which was up from 60.8% in 2016.\nWithin the Storage Solutions business, rental, selling and general expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 increased $22.5 million, or 9.2%, from 2016. Included in Storage Solutions rental, selling and general expenses for 2017 and 2016 were $2.6 million and $0.8 million, respectively, of expenses that were not indicative of our operations, primarily costs associated with the severance and transition of executive officers.\nExcluding the expenses discussed above, rental, selling and general expenses within the Storage Solutions business increased $20.7 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the 2016 period. When further adjusted for the effect of the change in currency translation rates, rental selling and general expenses for the Storage Solutions business increased $23.3 million. This increase was driven largely by higher variable compensation in 2017, as compared to 2016. In addition, transportation costs and payroll increased due to increased rental activity.\nRental, selling and general expenses for the Tank & Pump Solutions business increased $4.7 million in 2017, as compared to 2016. The increase was largely due to increased payroll and variable compensation.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales is the cost related to our sales revenue only. Within the Storage Solutions business, cost of sales was $17.9 million and $13.3 million in the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Storage Solutions sales profit was $9.1 million and $8.3 million for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Sales profit expressed as a percentage of sales revenue (sales profit margin) was 33.6% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 38.3% in the prior-year period. The decrease in profit margin is due to sales activity related to the recent U.K. acquisition.\nWithin the Tank & Pump Solutions business, cost of sales was $3.1 million and $3.2 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Tank & Pump Solutions sales profit was $2.4 million and $1.8 million for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nRestructuring expenses. The restructuring expenses in 2017 and 2016 resulted primarily to the continuation of projects initiated in prior years. Included in restructuring expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were\napproximately $1.3 million and $2.0 million, respectively, of expenses related to the integration of our wholly owned subsidiary ETS into the existing Mobile Mini infrastructure. Also included in restructuring expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $0.9 million and $3.3 million, respectively of costs related to the divestiture of our wood mobile office business, primarily related to the abandonment of yards, or portions of yards. The remaining restructuring expenses in both years relate largely to divisional and corporate departmental restructurings. We expect to recognize less than $0.5 million in restructuring expenses related to these restructurings in 2018.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense of $63.4 million decreased slightly in the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 2016.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased $3.0 million to $35.7 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $32.7 million in the prior-year period. The 9.2% increase is primarily due to higher interest rates on the line of credit, partially offset by a decrease in the effective interest rate on our bonds due to the issuance of the 2024 Notes and extinguishment of the 2020 Notes in the second quarter of 2016.\nOur average debt outstanding in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $934.5 million, as compared to $929.1 million in the prior-year period. The weighted average interest rate on our debt was 3.6% and 3.3% for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, excluding the amortization of debt issuance costs. Taking into account the amortization of debt issuance costs, the weighted average interest rate was 3.8% and 3.5% for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nDebt Extinguishment Expense and Deferred Financing Costs Write-off. As a result of the redemption of the 2020 Notes in 2016, we recognized $9.2 million in debt extinguishment expense, consisting of $7.9 million in debt redemption premiums and $1.3 million in contractually required interest above the amount payable prior to the redemption. Additionally, we wrote off $2.3 million of previously deferred costs associated with the 2020 Notes that had not yet been amortized.\n(Benefit) Provision for Income Taxes. The effective income tax (benefit) rate of (64.9%) for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily impacted by the accounting for the U.S. Tax reform enacted on December 22, 2017 which reduced the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The company recognized a net benefit of $77.6 million related to the remeasurement of its net deferred tax liabilities for this rate change, affecting the rate by (104.7%). Additionally, the company recorded a provisional expense of $3.1 million for the mandatory repatriation of foreign earnings, affecting the rate by 4.2%. Excluding the effects of tax reform, our tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 35.6%.\nThe increase to 35.6% from the effective tax rate of 31.4% for the prior-year period is due to an enacted U.K. rate change in 2016, reducing the rate applied to deferred tax balances from 18% to 17%, which resulted in a $0.9 million benefit for the year ended December 31, 2016. Additionally, changes in foreign rate differentials contributed to the overall effective tax rate increase. The change in foreign rate differentials was caused by the utilization of all remaining U.K. net operating losses during 2017, resulting in higher tax rates on our current year U.K. income. Based on information currently available to us, we estimate that our 2018 effective tax rate will be between 24% and 26%.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately $206.4 million, which expires, if unused, from 2028 to 2034. In addition, we had net operating loss carryforwards in the various states in which we operate. Over the past three years, we have generated $122.2 million of federal taxable income and we expect to utilize the unreserved net operating loss carryforwards prior to expiration. At December 31, 2017, we had $79.8 million of gross deferred tax assets included within the net deferred tax liability on our balance sheet, and a $1.1 million valuation allowance. We believe, based on internal projections, that we will generate sufficient taxable income needed to realize the corresponding unreserved federal and state deferred tax assets to the extent they are recorded as deferred tax assets in our balance sheet. However, given that the federal net operating loss carryforwards that give rise to the deferred tax asset expire over seven years beginning in 2028, there could be changes in management's judgment in future periods with respect to the recoverability of these assets. See Note 7 Income Taxes\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion on income taxes.\nNet Income. As a result of the income statement activity discussed above, we had net income of $122.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Excluding the effect of the tax legislation, we estimate our net income would have been approximately $47.7 million, as compared to $47.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA. For the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017, we realized adjusted EBITDA of $184.8 million, a decrease of $5.6 million, or 2.9%, as compared to adjusted EBITDA of $190.4 million in 2016. Growth in our\nStorage Solutions business revenue was offset by a decrease in the Tank & Pump Solutions business, overall increased rental, selling and general costs primarily driven by increased variable compensation in the current-year period and an unfavorable currency exchange rate. Our adjusted EBITDA margins were 34.6% and 37.4 % for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, adjusted EBITDA related to the Storage Solutions business decreased $1.0 million, or 0.6%, to $158.0 million, from $159.0 million in the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA related to the Tank & Pump Solutions business decreased $4.5 million, or 14.5%, to $26.8 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, from $31.4 million during 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were 36.3% for the Storage Solutions business and 27.4% for the Tank & Pump Solutions business.\nThe full-year adjusted EBITDA was favorably impacted by a strong fourth quarter in which we realized adjusted EBITDA of $55.6 million, an increase of $1.5 million, or 2.7%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenue growth due to increased Tank & Pump Solutions business, and robust growth in our seasonal Storage Solutions revenues, while largely offset by increased variable compensation and other rental, selling and general expense increases, resulted in overall adjusted EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter.\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2016, Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2015\nThe following table sets forth for each of the periods indicated our statements of operations data and expresses revenue and expense data as percentage of total revenues for the periods presented:\n\n\n (1) See Non-GAAP Data and Reconciliations\u201d earlier in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n (2) The calculation of adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue includes a net reduction to revenues related to transactions not indicative of our business. See Non-GAAP Data and Reconciliations\u201d earlier in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nThe following table sets forth certain financial information as calculated on a constant currency basis:\n\n (1) See Non-GAAP Data and Reconciliations\u201d earlier in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nTotal Revenues. The following tables depict revenue by type of business for the twelve-month periods ended December 31:\n\n\nOf the $508.6 million of total revenues in 2016, $410.6 million, or 80.7%, related to the Storage Solutions business and $98.1 million, or 19.3%, related to the Tank & Pump Solutions business. In 2015, $423.5 million, or 79.8%, related to the Storage Solutions business and $107.3 million, or 20.2%, related to the Tank & Pump Solutions business. The wood mobile office business divested in May 2015 contributed approximately $16.9 million of total revenue and $15.8 million of rental revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nRental Revenues. Storage Solutions rental revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 increased $7.8 million, or 2.1%, as compared to 2015, excluding the effect of the wood mobile office fleet divestiture discussed above. Adjusting for an unfavorable change in currency translation rates and excluding the divested wood mobile office assets, rental revenue increased approximately 4.7% in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase was driven by a 2.3% increase in year-over-year rental rates and a 1.9% increase in units on rent. Excluding the divested wood mobile office fleet and adjusting for the unfavorable currency effect, yield in 2016 increased approximately 2.7% as compared to 2015, largely driven by the rate increase in 2016. The 4.7% rental revenue growth was achieved despite challenges related to turnover in our North American sales force, which we actively addressed through revised hiring processes, incremental sales management and focused training.\nRental revenues within the Tank & Pump Solutions business decreased $6.7 million, or 6.7%, for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015. This decline was primarily driven by decreases in upstream revenues due to challenges in the oil and gas sector, as well as a decrease in our diversified business caused by weakness in the mining sector and fewer infrastructure projects. Revenues in the downstream market increased slightly in 2016, as compared to 2015. High-capacity production resulting from lower oil prices has caused the postponement of maintenance projects in that sector.\nSales Revenues. We focus on rental revenues. In general, sales of units from our fleet occur due to a particular customer need, or due to having fleet in excess of demand at a particular location. Storage Solutions sales revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 decreased $0.8 million, or 3.6%, to $21.6 million, compared to $22.4 million in the 2015. Tank & Pump Solutions sales revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 decreased $2.6 million to $4.9 million, compared to $7.6 million in 2015.\nCosts and Expenses. The following tables depict costs and expenses by type of business for the twelve-month periods ended December 31:\n\n\nRental, Selling and General Expenses. Rental, selling and general expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 of $309.3 million decreased $17.0 million, or 5.2%, as compared to the prior-year period. This net decrease resulted from an $18.2 million reduction related to the Storage Solutions business, offset by a $1.3 million increase related to the Tank & Pump Solutions business. As a percentage of total revenues, rental, selling and general expenses were 60.8% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, which was down from 61.5% in 2015.\nWithin the Storage Solutions business, rental, selling and general expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 decreased $18.2 million, or 6.9%, from 2015. Included in the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $0.8 million and $7.9 million, respectively, of expenses that were not indicative of our operations. In 2016, the expenses were associated with the departure of an executive officer, a sales tax remittance and acquisition-related expenses. The rental, selling and general expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 included $2.6 million in acquisition-related expenses, $4.4 million of transition service expenses and $0.9 million of expenses related to an unclaimed property settlement.\nExcluding the expenses discussed above, rental, selling and general expenses within the Storage Solutions business decreased $11.2 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015. This decrease in Storage Solutions business rental, selling and general expenses was driven largely by fluctuations in currency translation rates, decreased variable compensation, including stock-based compensation, as well as lower fleet freight and fuel costs resulting from decreased activity due to the divestiture of our wood mobile office fleet, as well as lower fuel prices generally. Salaries and wages and other operating costs within the Storage Solutions business increased due to the expansion of shared services, as well as the implementation and operation of our new ERP system; however, these increases were largely offset by increased allocations of overhead expenses to the Tank & Pump Solutions business as we continue to consolidate our infrastructure and shared services.\nRental, selling and general expenses for the Tank & Pump Solutions business increased $1.3 million in 2016, as compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to increased allocations of overhead expenses to the Tank & Pump Solutions business, partially offset by decreases in salaries and wages and other operating costs. In 2016, the consolidation of our infrastructure and shared services resulted in the elimination of redundant employee positions. In addition, lower fleet freight and fuel costs resulted from decreased rental activity.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales is the cost related to our sales revenue only. Within the Storage Solutions business, cost of sales was $13.3 million and $14.6 million in the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nStorage Solutions sales profit was $8.3 million and $7.8 million for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Sales profit margin was 38.3% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 34.9% in 2015.\nWithin the Tank & Pump Solutions business, cost of sales was $3.2 million and $5.1 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Tank & Pump Solutions sales profit was $1.8 million and $2.5 million for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nRestructuring expenses. The restructuring expenses in 2016 resulted primarily to the continuation of projects initiated in prior years.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, $2.0 million and $19.7 million, respectively, related to activities associated with the integration of ETS into the existing Mobile Mini infrastructure, including the re-alignment of sales leadership with operational leadership.\nIntegration includes such activities as:\n \u2022 Combining Storage Solutions and Tank & Pump locations in markets where both lines of business are present, \n \u2022 Expanding either line of business to new geographies where we maintain a presence in the other, \n \u2022 Eliminating duplicative or redundant positions at both the corporate level and in operations, and \n \u2022 Determining the appropriate processes, including the alignment of sales leadership with operational leadership, and eliminating infrastructure that does not function optimally in the new environment. \nAlso included in restructuring expense were costs to shift our business away from the wood mobile office business, including abandonment of yards, totaling approximately $3.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOf the total $6.0 million of restructuring expense recognized in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, approximately $0.4 million was non-cash. Of the total $20.8 million of restructuring expense recognized in the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, approximately $17.0 million was non-cash.\nAsset Impairment Charge and Loss on Divestiture, Net. The $66.1 million net asset impairment charge and loss on divestiture for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was due to the impairment and sale of our wood mobile office fleet in our North American portable storage segment. See additional discussion regarding the impairment of the wood mobile office assets in Note 4 Impairment and Divestiture of North American Wood Mobile Offices\u201d to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $3.4 million in the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015. This increase was due primarily to increased depreciation expense related to property, plant and equipment, including the implementation of our new ERP system. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in depreciation expense related to the wood mobile office units divested in May 2015. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $1.3 million of depreciation expense related to these units.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense decreased $3.2 million, or 8.8%, to $32.7 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, compared to $35.9 million in 2015. Our average debt outstanding in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $929.1 million, as compared to $902.9 million in the prior-year period. The weighted average interest rate on our debt was 3.3% and 3.6% for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, excluding the amortization of debt issuance costs. Taking into account the amortization of debt issuance costs, the weighted average interest rate was 3.5% and 4.0% for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThe decrease in the effective interest rate was due to the issuance of the 2024 Notes and extinguishment of the 2020 Notes in the second quarter of 2016, along with the refinancing of our line of credit in the fourth quarter of 2015. Each of these activities resulted in lowered interest rates. See additional discussion in Note 6 Debt\u201d to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.\nDebt Extinguishment Expense and Deferred Financing Costs Write-off. As a result of the redemption of the 2020 Notes during 2016, we recognized $9.2 million in debt extinguishment expense, consisting of $7.9 million in debt redemption\npremiums and $1.3 million in contractually required interest above the amount payable prior to the redemption. Additionally, we wrote off $2.3 million of previously deferred costs associated with the 2020 Notes that had not yet been amortized.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we had a $21.7 million provision for income taxes, compared to a net benefit of $4.8 million in 2015. Our effective income tax rate was 31.4% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Our 2016 income tax was affected by an enacted tax rate change in the U.K. reducing the tax rate from 18% to 17% and deductions for stock compensation. Our 2015 income tax was affected similarly by an enacted rate change in the U.K. income tax rate reducing the tax rate from 20% to 18%, as well as losses in North America driven by the asset impairment and restructuring expenses as discussed previously in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The change in the U.K. income tax rate resulted in a $0.9 million benefit and $1.4 million benefit for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nExcluding the North America asset impairment and the $1.4 million cumulative effect on 2015 deferred liabilities of the U.K. rate change, our tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 33.4%. The decrease from 33.4% to 31.4% resulted primarily from the enacted tax rate change in the U.K. as discussed above and certain stock compensation deductions.\nNet Income. As a result of the income statement activity discussed above, we had net income of $47.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $5.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.\nAdjusted EBITDA. For the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2016, we realized adjusted EBITDA of $190.4 million, a decrease of $10.5 million, or 5.2%, as compared to adjusted EBITDA of $200.8 million in the prior-year period. Growth in our Storage Solutions business was offset by short-term pressure resulting from the divestiture of our wood mobile office fleet, unfavorable currency fluctuations of $4.0 million, increased repairs and maintenance expense, and increased operating costs related to our recently implemented ERP system, as well as the year-over-year decline in Tank & Pump Solutions rental revenue. Our adjusted EBITDA margins were 37.4% and 38.1% for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, adjusted EBITDA related to the Storage Solutions business decreased $1.7 million, or 1.1%, to $159.0 million, from $160.7 million in 2015. Adjusted EBITDA related to the Tank & Pump Solutions business decreased $8.8 million, or 21.8%, to $31.4 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, from $40.2 million in 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 were 38.7% for the Storage Solutions business and 32.0% for the Tank & Pump Solutions business.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nRenting is a capital-intensive business that requires us to acquire assets before they generate revenues, cash flow and earnings. The majority of the assets that we rent have very long useful lives and require relatively little maintenance expenditures. Most of the capital we have deployed in our rental business historically has been used to expand our operations geographically, to execute opportunistic acquisitions, to increase the number of units available for rent at our existing locations, and to add to the mix of products we offer. During recent years, our operations have generated annual cash flow that exceeds our pre-tax earnings, particularly due to cash flow from operations and the deferral of income taxes caused by accelerated depreciation of our fixed assets in our tax return filings. Our strong cash from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 of $135.6 million, $136.2 million and $152.8 million, respectively, resulted in free cash flow of $65.6 million, $64.7 million and $73.6 million, respectively. In addition to free cash flow, our principal current source of liquidity is the Credit Agreement described below.\nRevolving Credit Facility. On December 14, 2015, we entered into the Credit Agreement with Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, as administrative agent, and other lenders party thereto. The Credit Agreement provides for a five-year, $1.0 billion first lien senior secured revolving credit facility maturing on or before the earlier of (i) December 14, 2020 and (ii) the date that is 90 days prior to the final maturity date of the Senior Notes if such Senior Notes remain outstanding on such date. The Credit Agreement also provides for the issuance of irrevocable standby letters of credit by U.S. lenders in amounts totaling up to $50.0 million, by U.K.-based lenders in amounts totaling up to $20.0 million, and by Canadian-based lenders in amounts totaling up to $20.0 million.\nThe obligations of us and our subsidiary guarantors under the Credit Agreement are secured by a blanket lien on substantially all of our assets. At December 31, 2017, we had $634.3 million of borrowings outstanding and $361.4 million of additional borrowing availability under the Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with the terms of the Credit\nAgreement as of December 31, 2017 and were above the minimum borrowing availability threshold and therefore not subject to any financial maintenance covenants.\nAmounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement and repaid or prepaid during the term may be reborrowed. Outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement bear interest at our option at either: (i) the London interbank offered rate ( LIBOR\u201d) plus an applicable margin ( LIBOR Loans\u201d), or (ii) the prime rate plus an applicable margin ( Base Rate Loans\u201d). The applicable margin for each type of loan is based on an availability-based pricing grid and ranges from 1.25% to 1.75% for LIBOR Loans and 0.25% to 0.75% for Base Rate Loans at each measurement date. The margins in effect as of December 31, 2017 are 1.50% for LIBOR Loans and 0.50% for Base Rate Loans.\nAvailability of borrowings under the Credit Agreement is subject to a borrowing base calculation based upon a valuation of our eligible accounts receivable, eligible rental fleet (including units held for sale, work-in-process and raw materials) and machinery and equipment, each multiplied by an applicable advance rate or limit. The rental fleet is appraised at least once annually by a third-party appraisal firm and up to 90% of the net orderly liquidation value, as defined in the Credit Agreement, is included in the borrowing base to determine how much we may borrow under the Credit Agreement.\nThe Credit Agreement provides for U.K. borrowings, which are, at our option, denominated in either Pounds Sterling or Euros, by our U.K. subsidiary based upon a U.K. borrowing base; Canadian borrowings, which are denominated in Canadian dollars, by our Canadian subsidiary based upon a Canadian borrowing base; and U.S. borrowings, which are denominated in U.S. dollars, based upon a U.S. borrowing base along with any Canadian assets not included in the Canadian subsidiary.\nThe Credit Agreement also contains customary negative covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things: (i) allow certain liens to attach to Mobile Mini or subsidiary assets, (ii) repurchase or pay dividends or make certain other restricted", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in those forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those described under Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d The tables and information in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations\u201d section were derived from exact numbers and may have immaterial rounding differences.\nOverview\nExecutive Summary\nThroughout 2017, our continuing operational strategic goals included growing revenue and expanding our operating margins by leveraging our infrastructure, focusing on higher returning assets and driving continuous improvements in efficiency. To achieve these goals, we concentrated on generating growth in our core rental business through strong organic growth. We also actively manage fleet utilization and seek to control costs.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d), which, among other things, reduces the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, and requires mandatory repatriation of foreign earnings. As a result of the Tax Act, we remeasured our net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a net tax benefit of $77.6 million. In addition, we recorded a provisional income tax expense of $3.1 million related to the repatriation of foreign earnings. We estimate that our 2018 consolidated effective tax rate will be between 24% and 26%. We do not expect a significant near-term impact on cash paid for taxes.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our network includes 121 Storage Solutions locations, 17 Tank & Pump locations and 16 combined locations. Our Storage Solutions fleet consists of approximately 215,000 units and our Tank & Pump Solutions business has a fleet of approximately 12,100 units.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, our achievements include:\n \u2022 Grew total rental revenues 4.7% year-over-year, when adjusting for the unfavorable effect of currency fluctuations, \n \u2022 Within the Storage Solutions business, which represented approximately 82% of rental revenue in 2017: \n - Grew total rental revenues 6.0% year-over-year, when adjusting for unfavorable currency fluctuations, \n - Increased year-over-year Storage Solutions rental rates by 4.2%, and \n - Increased average units on rent by 4.6%, and year-end units on rent by 6.0%, \n \u2022 Successfully positioned our Tank & Pump Solutions business to take advantage of positive trends in our underlying markets, resulting in: \n - Sequential rental revenue growth each quarter of 2017, and \n - Fourth quarter year-over-year rental revenue growth of 14.2% \n \u2022 Generated adjusted EBITDA of $184.8 million, with a 34.6% margin, \n \u2022 Achieved world-class safety results, with a North American TRIR of less than 1.0, \n \u2022 Implemented digital solutions across our businesses to drive market share, especially with large customers that value this deepened technology, and \n \u2022 Generated $65.6 million in free cash flow and returned $48.5 million to shareholders through dividends and treasury share repurchases. \nBusiness Environment and Outlook\nApproximately 66% of our rental revenue during the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017 was derived from our North American Storage Solutions business, 18% was derived from our Tank & Pump Solutions business in North America and 16% was derived from our U.K. Storage Solutions business. Our business is subject to the general health of the economy and we utilize a variety of general economic indicators to assess market trends and determine the direction of our business. Based on analyst growth estimates for the industries we operate in, we currently expect that the majority of our end markets will continue to drive demand for our products in 2018. In particular, construction, which represents approximately 41% of our consolidated rental revenue is forecasted for continued growth for the next several years. While only 2% of our consolidated rental revenue is generated by oil and gas customers, the oil and gas industry is forecasted to grow in 2018. In the U.K. our end markets are currently stable; however, the overall U.K. economy faces some uncertainty related to Brexit.\nAccounting and Operating Overview\nOur principal operating revenues and expenses are:\nRevenues:\n \u2022 Rental revenues include all rent and ancillary revenues we receive for our rental fleet. \n \u2022 Sales revenues consist primarily of sales of new and used fleet and, to a lesser extent, parts and supplies sold to customers. \nCosts and Expenses:\n \u2022 Rental, selling and general expenses include, among other expenses, payroll and payroll-related costs (including share-based compensation and commissions for our sales team), fleet transportation and fuel costs, repair and maintenance costs for our rental fleet and transportation equipment, real estate lease expense, insurance costs, and general corporate expenses. \n \u2022 Cost of sales is the net book value of the units that were sold during the reported period and includes both our cost to buy, transport, remanufacture and modify used containers and our cost to manufacture Storage Solutions units and other structures. \n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation on our rental fleet, our property, plant and equipment, and amortization of definite-lived intangible assets. \nIn addition to focusing on GAAP measurements, we focus on EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow to measure our operating results. As such, we include in this Annual Report on Form 10-K reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. We also evaluate our operations on a constant currency basis. These reconciliations and descriptions of why we believe these measures provide useful information to investors as well as a description of the limitations of these measures are included in Item 6.

In the prior year, $410.6 million, or 80.7%, related to the Storage Solutions business and $98.1 million, or 19.3%, related to the Tank & Pump Solutions business.\nRental Revenues. Storage Solutions rental revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 increased $19.4 million, or 5.0%, as compared to the prior-year period. Adjusting for an unfavorable change in currency translation rates rental revenue increased approximately 6.0%, as compared to the prior-year period. The increase was driven by a 3.1% increase in year-over-year rental rates and a 4.6% increase in units on rent. Adjusting for the unfavorable currency effect, yield (calculated as rental revenues divided by average units on rent) increased approximately 1.4% as compared to the prior-year period, driven by the rate increase in the current-year period, offset by changes in mix and other rental items. The full year rental revenue increase was impacted by strong fourth quarter year-over-year increases in seasonal business. Storage Solutions rental revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 9.8%, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, when adjusted for the impact of currency fluctuations.\nRental revenues within the Tank & Pump Solutions business decreased $0.7 million, or 0.8%, for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior-year period. Decreased year-over-year rental revenue in the first nine months of 2017 was largely offset by increased year-over-year rental revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017. Rental revenues for the first nine months of 2017 decreased $3.9 million, or 5.5% when compared to the same period in 2016, due primarily to decreased demand from our downstream customers as well as fewer infrastructure projects in our pump business. Fourth quarter 2017 rental revenue for our Tank & Pump Solutions business increased $3.2 million, or 14.2%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 due to the resumption of previously deferred maintenance in our downstream market, increased demand overall and new business. Demand from our customers is improving and we have positioned ourselves as a company to take advantage of positive trends in the underlying markets.\nSales Revenues. We focus on rental revenues. In general, sales of units from our fleet occur due to a particular customer need, or due to having fleet in excess of demand at a particular location. Storage Solutions sales revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 increased $5.4 million, or 25.1%, to $27.0 million, compared to $21.6 million in the prior-year period. The growth was largely due to increased activity in the U.K. resulting from a recent acquisition. Tank & Pump Solutions sales revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 increased $0.5 million to $5.4 million, compared to $4.9 million in the prior-year period.\nCosts and Expenses.

Rental, selling and general expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 of $336.4 million increased $27.1 million, or 8.8%, as compared to 2016. Of this total increase, $22.5 million related to the Storage Solutions business and $4.7 million related to the Tank & Pump Solutions business. As a percentage of total revenues, rental, selling and general expenses were 63.1% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, which was up from 60.8% in 2016.\nWithin the Storage Solutions business, rental, selling and general expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 increased $22.5 million, or 9.2%, from 2016. Included in Storage Solutions rental, selling and general expenses for 2017 and 2016 were $2.6 million and $0.8 million, respectively, of expenses that were not indicative of our operations, primarily costs associated with the severance and transition of executive officers.\nExcluding the expenses discussed above, rental, selling and general expenses within the Storage Solutions business increased $20.7 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the 2016 period. When further adjusted for the effect of the change in currency translation rates, rental selling and general expenses for the Storage Solutions business increased $23.3 million. This increase was driven largely by higher variable compensation in 2017, as compared to 2016. In addition, transportation costs and payroll increased due to increased rental activity.\nRental, selling and general expenses for the Tank & Pump Solutions business increased $4.7 million in 2017, as compared to 2016. The increase was largely due to increased payroll and variable compensation.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales is the cost related to our sales revenue only. Within the Storage Solutions business, cost of sales was $17.9 million and $13.3 million in the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Storage Solutions sales profit was $9.1 million and $8.3 million for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Sales profit expressed as a percentage of sales revenue (sales profit margin) was 33.6% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 38.3% in the prior-year period. The decrease in profit margin is due to sales activity related to the recent U.K. acquisition.\nWithin the Tank & Pump Solutions business, cost of sales was $3.1 million and $3.2 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Tank & Pump Solutions sales profit was $2.4 million and $1.8 million for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nRestructuring expenses. The restructuring expenses in 2017 and 2016 resulted primarily to the continuation of projects initiated in prior years. Included in restructuring expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were\napproximately $1.3 million and $2.0 million, respectively, of expenses related to the integration of our wholly owned subsidiary ETS into the existing Mobile Mini infrastructure. Also included in restructuring expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $0.9 million and $3.3 million, respectively of costs related to the divestiture of our wood mobile office business, primarily related to the abandonment of yards, or portions of yards. The remaining restructuring expenses in both years relate largely to divisional and corporate departmental restructurings. We expect to recognize less than $0.5 million in restructuring expenses related to these restructurings in 2018.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense of $63.4 million decreased slightly in the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 2016.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased $3.0 million to $35.7 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $32.7 million in the prior-year period. The 9.2% increase is primarily due to higher interest rates on the line of credit, partially offset by a decrease in the effective interest rate on our bonds due to the issuance of the 2024 Notes and extinguishment of the 2020 Notes in the second quarter of 2016.\nOur average debt outstanding in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $934.5 million, as compared to $929.1 million in the prior-year period. The weighted average interest rate on our debt was 3.6% and 3.3% for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, excluding the amortization of debt issuance costs. Taking into account the amortization of debt issuance costs, the weighted average interest rate was 3.8% and 3.5% for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nDebt Extinguishment Expense and Deferred Financing Costs Write-off. As a result of the redemption of the 2020 Notes in 2016, we recognized $9.2 million in debt extinguishment expense, consisting of $7.9 million in debt redemption premiums and $1.3 million in contractually required interest above the amount payable prior to the redemption. Additionally, we wrote off $2.3 million of previously deferred costs associated with the 2020 Notes that had not yet been amortized.\n(Benefit) Provision for Income Taxes. The effective income tax (benefit) rate of (64.9%) for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily impacted by the accounting for the U.S. Tax reform enacted on December 22, 2017 which reduced the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The company recognized a net benefit of $77.6 million related to the remeasurement of its net deferred tax liabilities for this rate change, affecting the rate by (104.7%). Additionally, the company recorded a provisional expense of $3.1 million for the mandatory repatriation of foreign earnings, affecting the rate by 4.2%. Excluding the effects of tax reform, our tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 35.6%.\nThe increase to 35.6% from the effective tax rate of 31.4% for the prior-year period is due to an enacted U.K. rate change in 2016, reducing the rate applied to deferred tax balances from 18% to 17%, which resulted in a $0.9 million benefit for the year ended December 31, 2016. Additionally, changes in foreign rate differentials contributed to the overall effective tax rate increase. The change in foreign rate differentials was caused by the utilization of all remaining U.K. net operating losses during 2017, resulting in higher tax rates on our current year U.K. income. Based on information currently available to us, we estimate that our 2018 effective tax rate will be between 24% and 26%.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately $206.4 million, which expires, if unused, from 2028 to 2034. In addition, we had net operating loss carryforwards in the various states in which we operate. Over the past three years, we have generated $122.2 million of federal taxable income and we expect to utilize the unreserved net operating loss carryforwards prior to expiration. At December 31, 2017, we had $79.8 million of gross deferred tax assets included within the net deferred tax liability on our balance sheet, and a $1.1 million valuation allowance. We believe, based on internal projections, that we will generate sufficient taxable income needed to realize the corresponding unreserved federal and state deferred tax assets to the extent they are recorded as deferred tax assets in our balance sheet. However, given that the federal net operating loss carryforwards that give rise to the deferred tax asset expire over seven years beginning in 2028, there could be changes in management's judgment in future periods with respect to the recoverability of these assets. See Note 7 Income Taxes\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion on income taxes.\nNet Income. As a result of the income statement activity discussed above, we had net income of $122.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Excluding the effect of the tax legislation, we estimate our net income would have been approximately $47.7 million, as compared to $47.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA. For the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017, we realized adjusted EBITDA of $184.8 million, a decrease of $5.6 million, or 2.9%, as compared to adjusted EBITDA of $190.4 million in 2016. Growth in our\nStorage Solutions business revenue was offset by a decrease in the Tank & Pump Solutions business, overall increased rental, selling and general costs primarily driven by increased variable compensation in the current-year period and an unfavorable currency exchange rate. Our adjusted EBITDA margins were 34.6% and 37.4 % for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, adjusted EBITDA related to the Storage Solutions business decreased $1.0 million, or 0.6%, to $158.0 million, from $159.0 million in the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA related to the Tank & Pump Solutions business decreased $4.5 million, or 14.5%, to $26.8 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, from $31.4 million during 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were 36.3% for the Storage Solutions business and 27.4% for the Tank & Pump Solutions business.\nThe full-year adjusted EBITDA was favorably impacted by a strong fourth quarter in which we realized adjusted EBITDA of $55.6 million, an increase of $1.5 million, or 2.7%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenue growth due to increased Tank & Pump Solutions business, and robust growth in our seasonal Storage Solutions revenues, while largely offset by increased variable compensation and other rental, selling and general expense increases, resulted in overall adjusted EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter.\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2016, Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2015\nThe

In 2015, $423.5 million, or 79.8%, related to the Storage Solutions business and $107.3 million, or 20.2%, related to the Tank & Pump Solutions business. The wood mobile office business divested in May 2015 contributed approximately $16.9 million of total revenue and $15.8 million of rental revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nRental Revenues. Storage Solutions rental revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 increased $7.8 million, or 2.1%, as compared to 2015, excluding the effect of the wood mobile office fleet divestiture discussed above. Adjusting for an unfavorable change in currency translation rates and excluding the divested wood mobile office assets, rental revenue increased approximately 4.7% in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase was driven by a 2.3% increase in year-over-year rental rates and a 1.9% increase in units on rent. Excluding the divested wood mobile office fleet and adjusting for the unfavorable currency effect, yield in 2016 increased approximately 2.7% as compared to 2015, largely driven by the rate increase in 2016. The 4.7% rental revenue growth was achieved despite challenges related to turnover in our North American sales force, which we actively addressed through revised hiring processes, incremental sales management and focused training.\nRental revenues within the Tank & Pump Solutions business decreased $6.7 million, or 6.7%, for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015. This decline was primarily driven by decreases in upstream revenues due to challenges in the oil and gas sector, as well as a decrease in our diversified business caused by weakness in the mining sector and fewer infrastructure projects. Revenues in the downstream market increased slightly in 2016, as compared to 2015. High-capacity production resulting from lower oil prices has caused the postponement of maintenance projects in that sector.\nSales Revenues. We focus on rental revenues. In general, sales of units from our fleet occur due to a particular customer need, or due to having fleet in excess of demand at a particular location. Storage Solutions sales revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 decreased $0.8 million, or 3.6%, to $21.6 million, compared to $22.4 million in the 2015. Tank & Pump Solutions sales revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 decreased $2.6 million to $4.9 million, compared to $7.6 million in 2015.\nCosts and Expenses.

Rental, selling and general expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 of $309.3 million decreased $17.0 million, or 5.2%, as compared to the prior-year period. This net decrease resulted from an $18.2 million reduction related to the Storage Solutions business, offset by a $1.3 million increase related to the Tank & Pump Solutions business. As a percentage of total revenues, rental, selling and general expenses were 60.8% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, which was down from 61.5% in 2015.\nWithin the Storage Solutions business, rental, selling and general expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 decreased $18.2 million, or 6.9%, from 2015. Included in the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $0.8 million and $7.9 million, respectively, of expenses that were not indicative of our operations. In 2016, the expenses were associated with the departure of an executive officer, a sales tax remittance and acquisition-related expenses. The rental, selling and general expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 included $2.6 million in acquisition-related expenses, $4.4 million of transition service expenses and $0.9 million of expenses related to an unclaimed property settlement.\nExcluding the expenses discussed above, rental, selling and general expenses within the Storage Solutions business decreased $11.2 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015. This decrease in Storage Solutions business rental, selling and general expenses was driven largely by fluctuations in currency translation rates, decreased variable compensation, including stock-based compensation, as well as lower fleet freight and fuel costs resulting from decreased activity due to the divestiture of our wood mobile office fleet, as well as lower fuel prices generally. Salaries and wages and other operating costs within the Storage Solutions business increased due to the expansion of shared services, as well as the implementation and operation of our new ERP system; however, these increases were largely offset by increased allocations of overhead expenses to the Tank & Pump Solutions business as we continue to consolidate our infrastructure and shared services.\nRental, selling and general expenses for the Tank & Pump Solutions business increased $1.3 million in 2016, as compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to increased allocations of overhead expenses to the Tank & Pump Solutions business, partially offset by decreases in salaries and wages and other operating costs. In 2016, the consolidation of our infrastructure and shared services resulted in the elimination of redundant employee positions. In addition, lower fleet freight and fuel costs resulted from decreased rental activity.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales is the cost related to our sales revenue only. Within the Storage Solutions business, cost of sales was $13.3 million and $14.6 million in the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nStorage Solutions sales profit was $8.3 million and $7.8 million for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Sales profit margin was 38.3% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 34.9% in 2015.\nWithin the Tank & Pump Solutions business, cost of sales was $3.2 million and $5.1 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Tank & Pump Solutions sales profit was $1.8 million and $2.5 million for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nRestructuring expenses. The restructuring expenses in 2016 resulted primarily to the continuation of projects initiated in prior years.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, $2.0 million and $19.7 million, respectively, related to activities associated with the integration of ETS into the existing Mobile Mini infrastructure, including the re-alignment of sales leadership with operational leadership.\nIntegration includes such activities as:\n \u2022 Combining Storage Solutions and Tank & Pump locations in markets where both lines of business are present, \n \u2022 Expanding either line of business to new geographies where we maintain a presence in the other, \n \u2022 Eliminating duplicative or redundant positions at both the corporate level and in operations, and \n \u2022 Determining the appropriate processes, including the alignment of sales leadership with operational leadership, and eliminating infrastructure that does not function optimally in the new environment. \nAlso included in restructuring expense were costs to shift our business away from the wood mobile office business, including abandonment of yards, totaling approximately $3.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOf the total $6.0 million of restructuring expense recognized in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, approximately $0.4 million was non-cash. Of the total $20.8 million of restructuring expense recognized in the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, approximately $17.0 million was non-cash.\nAsset Impairment Charge and Loss on Divestiture, Net. The $66.1 million net asset impairment charge and loss on divestiture for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was due to the impairment and sale of our wood mobile office fleet in our North American portable storage segment. See additional discussion regarding the impairment of the wood mobile office assets in Note 4 Impairment and Divestiture of North American Wood Mobile Offices\u201d to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $3.4 million in the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015. This increase was due primarily to increased depreciation expense related to property, plant and equipment, including the implementation of our new ERP system. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in depreciation expense related to the wood mobile office units divested in May 2015. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $1.3 million of depreciation expense related to these units.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense decreased $3.2 million, or 8.8%, to $32.7 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, compared to $35.9 million in 2015. Our average debt outstanding in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $929.1 million, as compared to $902.9 million in the prior-year period. The weighted average interest rate on our debt was 3.3% and 3.6% for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, excluding the amortization of debt issuance costs. Taking into account the amortization of debt issuance costs, the weighted average interest rate was 3.5% and 4.0% for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThe decrease in the effective interest rate was due to the issuance of the 2024 Notes and extinguishment of the 2020 Notes in the second quarter of 2016, along with the refinancing of our line of credit in the fourth quarter of 2015. Each of these activities resulted in lowered interest rates. See additional discussion in Note 6 Debt\u201d to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.\nDebt Extinguishment Expense and Deferred Financing Costs Write-off. As a result of the redemption of the 2020 Notes during 2016, we recognized $9.2 million in debt extinguishment expense, consisting of $7.9 million in debt redemption\npremiums and $1.3 million in contractually required interest above the amount payable prior to the redemption. Additionally, we wrote off $2.3 million of previously deferred costs associated with the 2020 Notes that had not yet been amortized.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we had a $21.7 million provision for income taxes, compared to a net benefit of $4.8 million in 2015. Our effective income tax rate was 31.4% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Our 2016 income tax was affected by an enacted tax rate change in the U.K. reducing the tax rate from 18% to 17% and deductions for stock compensation. Our 2015 income tax was affected similarly by an enacted rate change in the U.K. income tax rate reducing the tax rate from 20% to 18%, as well as losses in North America driven by the asset impairment and restructuring expenses as discussed previously in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The change in the U.K. income tax rate resulted in a $0.9 million benefit and $1.4 million benefit for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nExcluding the North America asset impairment and the $1.4 million cumulative effect on 2015 deferred liabilities of the U.K. rate change, our tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 33.4%. The decrease from 33.4% to 31.4% resulted primarily from the enacted tax rate change in the U.K. as discussed above and certain stock compensation deductions.\nNet Income. As a result of the income statement activity discussed above, we had net income of $47.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $5.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.\nAdjusted EBITDA. For the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2016, we realized adjusted EBITDA of $190.4 million, a decrease of $10.5 million, or 5.2%, as compared to adjusted EBITDA of $200.8 million in the prior-year period. Growth in our Storage Solutions business was offset by short-term pressure resulting from the divestiture of our wood mobile office fleet, unfavorable currency fluctuations of $4.0 million, increased repairs and maintenance expense, and increased operating costs related to our recently implemented ERP system, as well as the year-over-year decline in Tank & Pump Solutions rental revenue. Our adjusted EBITDA margins were 37.4% and 38.1% for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, adjusted EBITDA related to the Storage Solutions business decreased $1.7 million, or 1.1%, to $159.0 million, from $160.7 million in 2015. Adjusted EBITDA related to the Tank & Pump Solutions business decreased $8.8 million, or 21.8%, to $31.4 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, from $40.2 million in 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 were 38.7% for the Storage Solutions business and 32.0% for the Tank & Pump Solutions business.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nRenting is a capital-intensive business that requires us to acquire assets before they generate revenues, cash flow and earnings. The majority of the assets that we rent have very long useful lives and require relatively little maintenance expenditures. Most of the capital we have deployed in our rental business historically has been used to expand our operations geographically, to execute opportunistic acquisitions, to increase the number of units available for rent at our existing locations, and to add to the mix of products we offer. During recent years, our operations have generated annual cash flow that exceeds our pre-tax earnings, particularly due to cash flow from operations and the deferral of income taxes caused by accelerated depreciation of our fixed assets in our tax return filings. Our strong cash from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 of $135.6 million, $136.2 million and $152.8 million, respectively, resulted in free cash flow of $65.6 million, $64.7 million and $73.6 million, respectively. In addition to free cash flow, our principal current source of liquidity is the Credit Agreement described below.\nRevolving Credit Facility. On December 14, 2015, we entered into the Credit Agreement with Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, as administrative agent, and other lenders party thereto. The Credit Agreement provides for a five-year, $1.0 billion first lien senior secured revolving credit facility maturing on or before the earlier of (i) December 14, 2020 and (ii) the date that is 90 days prior to the final maturity date of the Senior Notes if such Senior Notes remain outstanding on such date. The Credit Agreement also provides for the issuance of irrevocable standby letters of credit by U.S. lenders in amounts totaling up to $50.0 million, by U.K.-based lenders in amounts totaling up to $20.0 million, and by Canadian-based lenders in amounts totaling up to $20.0 million.\nThe obligations of us and our subsidiary guarantors under the Credit Agreement are secured by a blanket lien on substantially all of our assets. At December 31, 2017, we had $634.3 million of borrowings outstanding and $361.4 million of additional borrowing availability under the Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with the terms of the Credit\nAgreement as of December 31, 2017 and were above the minimum borrowing availability threshold and therefore not subject to any financial maintenance covenants.\nAmounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement and repaid or prepaid during the term may be reborrowed. Outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement bear interest at our option at either: (i) the London interbank offered rate ( LIBOR\u201d) plus an applicable margin ( LIBOR Loans\u201d), or (ii) the prime rate plus an applicable margin ( Base Rate Loans\u201d). The applicable margin for each type of loan is based on an availability-based pricing grid and ranges from 1.25% to 1.75% for LIBOR Loans and 0.25% to 0.75% for Base Rate Loans at each measurement date. The margins in effect as of December 31, 2017 are 1.50% for LIBOR Loans and 0.50% for Base Rate Loans.\nAvailability of borrowings under the Credit Agreement is subject to a borrowing base calculation based upon a valuation of our eligible accounts receivable, eligible rental fleet (including units held for sale, work-in-process and raw materials) and machinery and equipment, each multiplied by an applicable advance rate or limit. The rental fleet is appraised at least once annually by a third-party appraisal firm and up to 90% of the net orderly liquidation value, as defined in the Credit Agreement, is included in the borrowing base to determine how much we may borrow under the Credit Agreement.\nThe Credit Agreement provides for U.K. borrowings, which are, at our option, denominated in either Pounds Sterling or Euros, by our U.K. subsidiary based upon a U.K. borrowing base; Canadian borrowings, which are denominated in Canadian dollars, by our Canadian subsidiary based upon a Canadian borrowing base; and U.S. borrowings, which are denominated in U.S. dollars, based upon a U.S. borrowing base along with any Canadian assets not included in the Canadian subsidiary.\nThe Credit Agreement also contains customary negative covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things: (i) allow certain liens to attach to Mobile Mini or subsidiary assets, (ii) repurchase or pay dividends or make certain other restricted"}
