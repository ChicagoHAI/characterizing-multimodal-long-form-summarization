MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nExecutive Summary\nOur company is comprised of a dynamic portfolio of media and digital businesses that provide content that matters and brands that deliver. Our media business includes 46 television stations operating in 38 markets, offering high-quality television programming and digital content. Our digital business primarily consists of our Cars.com and CareerBuilder business units that operate in the automotive and human capital solutions industries. Cars.com is a leading online destination for automotive consumers offering credible, objective information about car shopping, selling and servicing. CareerBuilder helps companies target, attract and retain workforce talent through an array of product offerings including talent management software and other advertising and recruitment solutions.\nOn September 7, 2016, we announced our intention to spin-off the Cars.com business unit into a separate stand-alone public company and we also announced our plans to conduct a strategic review of our 53% ownership interest in CareerBuilder. While we perform the necessary steps to complete the spin and strategic review, we will maintain the current operating and reporting structure and will continue to report the financial results of both entities in continuing operations within our Digital Segment.\nFiscal year: Beginning in fiscal year 2015, we changed our financial reporting cycle to a calendar year-end. Accordingly, our 2015 fiscal year began on December 29, 2014 (the day after the end of the 2014 fiscal year) and ended on December 31, 2015. Historically, our fiscal year was a 52-53 week fiscal year that ended on the last Sunday of the calendar year. As a result, our 2015 fiscal year had two more days than fiscal year 2016. The impact of the extra days in 2015 did not have a material impact on our financial statements; and therefore, we have not restated the historical results.\nConsolidated Results from Operations\nA consolidated summary of our results is presented below.\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In millions of dollars\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Media\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1%)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Digital\n</td> <td>1,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3%\n</td> <td>1,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47%\n</td> <td>934\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3%)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>955\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and admin. expenses\n</td> <td>1,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2%\n</td> <td>1,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39%\n</td> <td>767\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1%)\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6%\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td>115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1%\n</td> <td>114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73%\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairment and facility consolidation charges (gains)\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>***\n</td> <td>(59\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>***\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>707\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-operating expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(260\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(10%)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(290\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>***\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>283\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14%)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>234\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(51\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(19%)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(63\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(7%)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(68\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48%)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>688\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from continuing operations per share - basic\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48%)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from continuing operations per share - diluted\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(47%)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.97\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Note: Numbers may not sum due to rounding.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated Operating Revenue\nOperating revenues increased $290 million, or 10%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. This increase is comprised of a $252 million increase from our Media Segment and a $39 million increase at our Digital Segment. Record Media Segment revenues of $1.93 billion were driven by political advertising revenue of $155 million, record Summer Olympics revenue of $56 million in the third quarter of 2016, and a substantial increase of retransmission revenue of $133 million and online revenue of $13 million. These increases were partially offset by a $20 million decrease in core advertising due in part to election year political displacement. Increases in the Digital Segment were driven by continued revenue growth at Cars.com of $37 million, G/O Digital of $28 million and CareerBuilder of $16 million. These increases at the Digital Segment were partially offset by the absence of $32 million of revenue contributed in 2015 by our PointRoll business, which was sold in November 2015.\nOperating revenues increased $425 million, or 16%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. This increase comprised a $435 million increase from our Digital Segment, partially offset by a $10 million decline at our Media Segment. Media Segment revenues for 2015 decreased 1% to $1.68 billion, as growth in retransmission revenue of $87 million, online revenue of $15 million, and higher core revenue of $26 million were offset by a decline of political advertising revenue of $138 million (from the record level of political advertising revenue of $159 million achieved in 2014). Digital Segment revenues totaled $1.37 billion for 2015, an increase of 47%. The increase reflects the impact of the Cars.com acquisition (acquired on October 1, 2014) as well as the strong organic growth of Cars.com revenue, as well as price increases for affiliates implemented October 1, 2014, resulting in an increase in revenue of $451 million in 2015. Partially offsetting the revenue increase at Cars.com, was a decrease of $20 million as a result of a decline in revenue and sale of our PointRoll business in November 2015.\nCosts of Revenue\nCost of revenue increased $116 million, or 13%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. This increase was primarily due to an $89 million increase in programming costs incurred by the Media Segment. In addition, our 2016 business acquisitions contributed $17 million to the increase, and cost increases at Cars.com added $11 million to our cost of revenue (primarily due to higher traffic acquisition costs and increased compensation costs).\nCost of revenue decreased $32 million, or 3%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. This decrease was due to a $25 million decrease at CareerBuilder primarily due to the expiration and non-renewal of certain revenue-share arrangements.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses increased $26 million, or 2%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase was primarily driven by the 2016 business acquisitions of Aurico, DealerRater, and Workterra, which increased selling, general, and administrative expenses by $18 million. In addition, severance expense increased $9 million year-over-year driven by a voluntary retirement program in our Media Segment completed in 2016. Our 2016 expenses also increased due to the absence of rental income at our corporate headquarters, which was $5 million in 2015, resulting from our sale of the building in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses increased $301 million, or 39%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. The majority of the increase was due to the October 2014 acquisition of the remaining ownership of Cars.com which resulted in a year over year increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $217 million.\nDepreciation Expense\nDepreciation expense decreased $1 million, or 1%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. This decrease is primarily due to a $5 million decline in depreciation at Corporate, primarily driven by the October 2015 sale of our corporate headquarters building that resulted in a year-over-year decrease in depreciation expense of $4 million. The decrease was also driven by the sale of our PointRoll business in November 2015, which led to a year-over-year decline in depreciation expense of $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by a $5 million increase in CareerBuilder's depreciation, which was due to the acquisition of new computer equipment, an increase in internally developed software and new leasehold improvements.\nDepreciation expense increased $5 million, or 6%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. The increase was due to the acquisition of Cars.com in October 2014 which resulted in a year over year increase in depreciation expense of $6 million.\nIntangible Asset Amortization Expense\nIntangible asset amortization expense increased by less than $1 million, or less than 1%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase was primarily driven by the 2016 acquisitions, which was substantially offset by a decline in amortization expense associated with previous acquisitions as a result of reaching the end of their useful lives.\nIntangible asset amortization expense increased $48 million, or 73%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. The October 2014 acquisition of Cars.com resulted in amortization expense in 2015 and 2014 of $73 million and $18 million, respectively. This increase was partially offset by a $7 million reduction in amortization expense related to certain intangible assets in 2015 as a result of reaching the end of their useful lives.\nAsset impairment and Facility Consolidation Charges (Gains)\nAsset impairment and facility consolidation charges (gains) fluctuated $91 million from a gain of ($59) million in 2015 to a charge of $32 million in 2016. The fluctuation was mainly due to the absence of the $90 million net gain from the sale of our corporate headquarters building in 2015. The 2016 charges were comprised of a goodwill impairment charge of $15 million incurred in the third quarter of 2016, a $6 million impairment related to a programming asset, a $5 million impairment charge related to a long-lived-asset, and a $5 million lease related charge.\nAsset impairment and facility consolidation charges (gains) fluctuated $104 million from charges of $45 million in 2014 to a gain of ($59) million in 2015. The year-over-year fluctuation was driven by the $90 million net gain from the sale of our corporate headquarters building in 2015, and by non-cash impairment charges of $31 million in 2014 related to certain reporting units within our Digital Segment (primarily PointRoll, ShopLocal and BLiNQ).\nOperating Income\nOperating income increased $59 million, or 6%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase was driven by the changes in revenue and operating expenses described above. Further, the increase in 2016 was partially offset by the absence of the $90 million gain on the sale of our corporate headquarters building in 2015. Our consolidated operating margins were lower at 29% in 2016 compared to 30% in 2015, primarily driven by the absence in 2016 of the net gain on the sale of our corporate headquarters building reported in 2015.\nOperating income increased $206 million, or 29%, in 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily driven by the acquisition of Cars.com which contributed $180 million of the increase. Our consolidated operating margins improved to 30% in 2015 compared to 27% in 2014 driven by improvement in margins from our Digital Segment as well as the net gain on the sale of our corporate headquarters building, partially offset by the impact from the absence of Winter Olympics and political spending in 2014.\nPayroll expense trends: Payroll expense is the largest element of our normal operating expenses, and is summarized below, expressed as a percentage of total pre-tax operating expenses. Payroll expense as a percentage of total pre-tax operating expenses decreased in 2016, reflecting that total operating expenses grew at a faster rate than payroll expense. Table 26: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payroll costs\n</td> <td>35.8%\n</td> <td>41.1%\n</td> <td>41.0%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-operating income and expense\nEquity earnings (losses): This income statement category reflects earnings or losses from our equity method investments. Equity losses increased $2 million, or 42% in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increased losses were primarily due to ($4 million) of impairment charges related to two equity method investments recorded in 2016. These impairment losses were partially offset by a year over year improvement in results for other equity method investments.\nEquity earnings (losses) fluctuated $156 million from a $151 million gain in 2014 to a ($5 million) loss in 2015. This fluctuation was primarily due to the absence of a $148 million gain on the sale of Apartments.com by Classified Ventures in 2014.\nInterest expense: Interest expense decreased $42 million, or 15%, in 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to lower average outstanding total debt balance and a lower average interest rate, reflecting the extinguishment of higher cost debt in 2015 and 2016, including the 10% senior notes and 7.125% notes that we repaid in April and November of 2016, respectively. The total average outstanding debt was $4.25 billion in 2016 compared to $4.37 billion in 2015. The weighted average interest rate on total outstanding debt was 5.29% in 2016, compared to 5.98% in 2015.\nInterest expense increased $1 million, or less than 1%, in 2015 as compared to 2014, due to a higher average debt level of $4.37 billion in 2015 compared to $3.85 billion in 2014. The higher average debt level was related to additional borrowing related to both the Belo and Cars.com acquisitions in 2013 and 2014, respectively, partly offset by a lower average interest rate. The weighted average interest rate on total outstanding debt was 5.98% in 2015, compared to 6.65% in 2014.\nA further discussion of our borrowing and related interest cost is presented in the Liquidity and capital resources\u201d section of this report beginning on page 26 and in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.\nOther non-operating items: Other non-operating items fluctuated $9 million from a loss of $12 million in 2015 to a loss of $20 million in 2016. The 2016 non-operating loss primarily consisted of $24 million in costs associated with the spin-off of our Cars.com business unit, the strategic review of CareerBuilder, and acquisition related costs. Our 2015 non-operating loss consisted of $45 million in costs related to the spin-off of our former publishing business and $9 million in costs incurred in connection with the early extinguishment of debt. These costs in 2015 were offset by a gain of $44 million on the sale of a business.\nOther non-operating items in 2014 represented a net gain of $404 million, with the majority related to the write-up of our prior 27% investment in Cars.com to fair value post-acquisition and a gain related to required accounting for the pre-existing affiliate agreement between Cars.com and us. This gain was partially offset by acquisition costs and expenses incurred for the spin-off of our publishing businesses completed in 2015.\nProvision for income taxes\nWe reported pre-tax income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA of $661 million for 2016. The effective tax rate on pre-tax income was 32.8%.\nWe reported pre-tax income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA of $560 million for 2015. The effective tax rate on pre-tax income was 36.1%.\nThe 2016 effective tax rate decreased as compared to 2015 primarily due to a decrease in TEGNA's state effective tax rate applied to our deferred tax items. This reduction of our state effective tax rate was driven by various tax planning initiatives, in particular a state income tax project that was concluded in the fourth quarter of 2016. When these tax items are reported on our future state tax returns, they will be subject to a lower tax rate than had been recorded previously, which created a deferred tax benefit in 2016 that reduced our effective tax rate. In addition, in the first quarter of 2016 we early adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) guidance on employee share-based payments that requires all excess tax benefits and tax deduction shortfalls to be recognized as an income tax benefit or expense in the income statement. As a result in 2016, we realized an excess tax benefit with respect to our employee share-based payments, which reduced our effective tax rate by 1% as compared to 2015. This FASB guidance will continue to apply in the future; however, among other factors, the amount of the income tax benefit or expense will be dependent on our future stock price, which cannot be accurately predicted.\nWe reported pre-tax income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA of $922 million for 2014. The provision for income taxes reflects a special net tax benefit from the sale of a non-strategic subsidiary at a loss, for which a partial tax benefit was recognized. The effective tax rate in 2014 was 25.4%.\nFurther information concerning income tax matters is contained in Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements.\nNet income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA Inc.\nNet income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA Inc. and related per share amounts are presented in the table below.\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In millions of dollars, except per share amounts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA Inc.\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48%)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>688\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Per basic share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48%)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Per diluted share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(47%)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.97\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA Inc. consists of net income from continuing operations reduced by net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, from CareerBuilder and its subsidiaries. We reported net income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA of $444 million or $2.02 per diluted share for 2016 compared to $357 million or $1.56 per diluted share for 2015.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $51 million in 2016, $63 million in 2015 and $68 million in 2014.\nEarnings per share benefited from a net decrease of approximately ten million diluted shares from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016, and approximately two million dilutive shares from December 31, 2014, to December 31, 2015, as a result of share repurchases, which were partially offset by share issuances under our stock-based award programs.\nOutlook for 2017: Based on current trends, we expect Media Segment revenue in the first quarter of 2017 to be flat to slightly above the first quarter of 2016. The year-over-year comparison will be unfavorably impacted by substantially lower political advertising revenue ($16 million in the first quarter of 2016) and the move of the Super Bowl to our 3 small FOX stations in 2017 from our 11 CBS stations in 2016. Excluding the unfavorable impact of the Super Bowl shift (approximately $9 million) and lower politically-related advertising, the percentage increase in Media Segment revenues is expected to be in the mid-single digits in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016.\nIn addition, beginning in January 2017, 11 of our NBC stations will be making reverse compensation payments for the first time. As such, 2017 will be a unique year as there will be an unfavorable gap between the increase in retransmission revenue we earn from multichannel video programming distributors (MVPD), compared to the increase in reverse compensation we will pay our affiliates. At the end of 2016, we renegotiated several new retransmission agreements with major MVPD carriers, and as a result, we have reduced our net retransmission gap in 2017 to approximately $25 million to $30 million. Further, we expect our strategic initiatives launched in 2016 (as discussed in our Media Segment section within Item 1 Business) will more than offset the remaining net retransmission gap in 2017.\nFor Cars.com, we are expecting modest single-digit revenue growth in the first quarter of 2017. We expect to see revenue growth in Cars.com national and major accounts businesses, but at a lower rate than during the same quarter last year primarily related to reduction in spending at two national accounts due to a transition to an advertising agency and a change in placement strategy during the first quarter. Once these transitions are completed, we expect these two\nnational accounts to increase their spending as we progress throughout the year.\nExcluding the impact of these two accounts, we expect Cars.com national and major accounts to be up in the range of 12% to 15% in the first quarter of 2017. While Cars.com is taking steps to improve, and in some cases restructure, the relationships with our affiliates, we expect a mid single-digit revenue decline in the first quarter of 2017 for affiliate revenues.\nThe following is a discussion of operating results of our Media and Digital Segments:\nMedia Segment\nAt the end of 2016, our Media operations included 46 television stations either owned or serviced through shared service agreements or other similar agreements.

The increase was driven by political advertising, a record level of Summer Olympics advertising, and a substantial increase in retransmission revenues. Core advertising revenues, which consist of local and national non-political advertising (and includes Olympics advertising), decreased $20 million or 2%, mostly due to: political advertising displacement; softer markets in the insurance and retail categories; and an $8 million impact related to two fewer days in 2016 as compared to 2015 as a result of the fiscal year-end change. These decreases were partially offset by a record $56 million Summer Olympics advertising revenue in the third quarter of 2016 which was up over 20% compared to the last Summer Olympics in 2012. Political advertising revenue increased $133 million due to the presidential election year political spending. Political revenues are cyclical and higher in even years (e.g. 2014, 2016). Retransmission revenues increased $133 million or 30% in 2016, reflecting retransmission agreements renewed at the end of last year, as well as annual rate increases for existing agreements. Digital revenues within our Media Segment increased $13 million or 12% primarily due to continued growth of digital marketing services products.\nMedia Segment operating expenses increased $159 million or 16% in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase was mainly due to an increase of $89 million in programming costs (primarily associated with reverse compensation to network affiliates related to retransmission revenue) as well as investments in growth initiatives, $19 million primarily related to severance charges incurred with the voluntary early retirement program and the absence of a $13 million building sale gain in the first quarter of 2015.\nAsset impairment charges recognized in 2016 primarily relate to a $6 million charge associated with an internally produced program and a $2 million impairment of a long-lived asset that is now classified as held for sale and was written down to its fair value in 2016.\nExcluding the impacts of the voluntary early retirement program expense and asset impairment charges in 2016 and the building sale gain in 2015, Media Segment operating expenses increased 14% in 2016.\nAs a result of all of these factors, Media Segment operating income increased to $806 million in 2016 from $714 million in 2015.\nMedia Segment results 2015-2014: Media Segment revenues decreased $10 million to $1.68 billion or 1% in 2015 as compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the absence of record level of political advertising revenue of $159 million and $41 million in Winter Olympics advertising revenue achieved during 2014. The change to a calendar year-end reporting cycle extended our fiscal 2015 by four extra days which increased Media Segment revenue by $11 million. Core advertising revenues increased $26 million or 3% in 2015. Political advertising revenue declined $138 million to $21 million in 2015. Retransmission revenues increased $87 million or 24% in 2015 resulting from newly negotiated agreements and annual rate increases. Within the Media Segment, digital revenue increased $15 million or 15% compared to 2014, reflecting continued growth from digital marketing services products.\nMedia Segment operating expenses increased $23 million or 2% in 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $22 million in programming costs as well as a $16 million increase in cost of digital initiatives, partially offset by a $13 million building sale gain in the first quarter of 2015.\nAs a result of all of these factors, Media Segment operating income decreased to $714 million in 2015 from $747 million in 2014.\nDigital Segment\nOur Digital Segment includes results for our stand-alone digital subsidiaries including Cars.com, CareerBuilder, G/O Digital and Cofactor (also operating as ShopLocal) business units. In December 2016, we sold our Cofactor business unit. In November 2015, we sold our PointRoll business unit which was previously part of Cofactor.\nMany of our other digital offerings are highly integrated within our Media Segment offerings; therefore, the results of these integrated digital offerings are reported within the operating results of our Media Segment.\nA summary of our Digital Segment results is presented below:\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In millions of dollars\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>934\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>1,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3%\n</td> <td>993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38%\n</td> <td>722\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9%\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44%\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1%\n</td> <td>92\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>***\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairment and facility consolidation charges\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5%)\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29%)\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>1,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3%\n</td> <td>1,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40%\n</td> <td>814\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNote: Numbers may not sum due to rounding.\nDigital Segment results 2016-2015: Our 2016 Digital Segment revenue was $1.41 billion, a record high. Digital Segment revenues increased $39 million, or 3%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase was driven by continued revenue growth at Cars.com of $37 million, or 6%, G/O Digital of $28 million or 94% (due to combination of a new commercial agreement which started in mid 2015 and organic growth) and CareerBuilder of $16 million, or 2%. These increases were partially offset by the sale of our former PointRoll business which contributed $32 million of revenue in 2015. The increase in Cars.com revenues was due to an increase in retail revenue (driven by increased subscription package volume and upsells and the acquisition of DealerRater) and higher national advertising purchased by auto manufacturers. The increase in CareerBuilder revenue was driven by $40 million of increases from employer services (driven by the acquisition of Aurico and higher revenue across sales channels due), $12 million of increased resume database revenues (due to sales and renewals of its new Recruitment Edge product) and $12 million from continued growth in software as a service (SaaS) revenues. These increases at CareerBuilder were partially offset by lower job site revenue of $48 million (due to lower job postings and competitive pricing pressure).\nDigital Segment expenses increased $38 million or 3% in 2016 as compared to 2015. This increase was driven by higher expenses at CareerBuilder of $47 million, primarily due to the acquisition of Aurico and Workterra. Also impacting the increase in 2016 was an increase in G/O Digital operating expenses of $24 million (due to a new commercial agreement which started in mid 2015) and an increase at Cars.com of $14 million (consistent with revenue growth). These increases are partially offset by the sale of our PointRoll business which resulted in a decline in operating expenses of $36 million, and the absence of $8 million of costs associated with our former BLiNQ business which was shut down in the second quarter of 2015.\nAs a result of these factors, Digital Segment operating income increased to $230 million in 2016.\nDigital Segment results 2015-2014: Digital Segment revenues increased $435 million, or 47%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. The increase was driven by the $451 million incremental full year impact of the Cars.com acquisition on October 1, 2014, partially offset by a decrease of revenues at CareerBuilder of $15 million, or 2%. The decrease in CareerBuilder revenues in 2015 was driven by the strategic shift in focus in its product offerings. During 2015, CareerBuilder continued its transition toward higher-margin software-as-a-service solutions, including its pre-hire platform and new recruitment software products. As a result, SaaS revenues increased $35 million, or 30%. These revenue increases were offset by declines from lower-margin, transactional source and screen arrangements and other transactional offerings totaling approximately $56 million, as CareerBuilder moved away from these product offerings to focus on the SaaS platform solutions. In addition, 2015 revenue increased $26 million due to G/O Digital (due to combination of a new commercial agreement which started in mid 2015 and organic growth), which was offset by 2015 declines in revenue of $24 million from various other digital business units (primarily PointRoll).\nDigital Segment expenses in 2015 increased $325 million, or 40%, primarily due to the $271 million incremental full year impact of the Cars.com acquisition and G/O Digital increase of $21 million (due to combination of a new commercial agreement in mid 2015 and organic growth). These increases were offset by a decrease in CareerBuilder expenses of $14 million, or 2%, (reflecting lower revenue and strategic shift in focus on its product offerings), and a $13 million reduction in expenses in the BLiNQ business, which was shut down in the second quarter of 2015.\nAs a result of these factors, Digital Segment operating income increased by $109 million or 91% in 2015.\nOperating results non-GAAP information\nPresentation of non-GAAP information: We use non-GAAP financial performance and liquidity measures to supplement the financial information presented on a GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the related GAAP measures, nor should they be considered superior to the related GAAP measures, and should be read together with financial information presented on a GAAP basis. Also, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nManagement and our Board of Directors use the non-GAAP financial measures for purposes of evaluating business unit and consolidated company performance. Furthermore, the Executive Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors uses non-GAAP measures such as Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow to evaluate management's performance. Therefore, we believe that each of the non-GAAP measures presented provides useful information to investors and other stakeholders by allowing them to view our business through the eyes of management and our Board of Directors, facilitating comparisons of results across historical periods and focus on the underlying ongoing operating performance of our business. We discuss in this Form 10-K non-GAAP financial performance measures that exclude from our reported GAAP results the impact of special items\u201d consisting of severance expense, impairment charges on operating assets and equity investments, facility consolidation charges, gains related to building sales, gains/losses related to business disposals, expenses related to business acquisitions, costs associated with the company's spin-off transactions, and benefits to our income tax provision. We also adjust net income attributed to noncontrolling interests to the extent any of the above items are related to our CareerBuilder business unit. We believe that such expenses, charges and gains are not indicative of normal, ongoing operations. Such items vary from period to period and are significantly impacted by the timing and nature of these events. Therefore, while we may incur or recognize these types of expenses, charges and gains in the future, we believe that removing these items for purposes of calculating the non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with a more focused presentation of our ongoing operating performance.\nWe discuss Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial performance measure that we believe offers a useful view of the overall operation of its businesses. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA before (1) net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, (2) interest expense, (3) income taxes, (4) equity income (losses) in unconsolidated investees, net, (5) other non-operating items such as spin-off transaction expense, investment income and currency gains and losses, (6) severance expense, (7) facility consolidation charges, (8) impairment charges, (9) depreciation and (10) amortization. When Adjusted EBITDA is discussed in reference to performance on a consolidated basis, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is Net income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA. We do not analyze non-operating items such as interest expense and income taxes on a segment level; therefore, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Adjusted EBITDA when performance is discussed on a segment level is Operating income. Users should consider the limitations of using Adjusted EBITDA, including the fact that this measure does not provide a complete measure of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to purport to be an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. In particular, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow available for management's discretionary expenditures, as this measure does not consider certain cash requirements, such as working capital needs, capital expenditures, contractual commitments, interest payments, tax payments and other debt service requirements.\nWe also discuss free cash flow, a non-GAAP liquidity measure (see Selected Financial Data on page 67). Free cash flow is defined as net cash flow from operating activities\u201d as reported on the statement of cash flows reduced by purchase of property and equipment\u201d. We believe that free cash flow is a useful measure for management and investors to evaluate the level of cash generated by operations and the ability of its operations to fund investments in new and existing businesses, return cash to shareholders under the company's capital program, repay indebtedness, add to our cash balance, or use in other discretionary activities. We use free cash flow to monitor cash available for repayment of indebtedness and in discussions with the investment community. Like Adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow is not intended to be a measure of cash flow available for management's discretionary use.\nDiscussion of special charges and credits affecting reported results:

The increase was driven by in an increase of $121 million or 15% in the Media Segment and the absence of $52 million in publishing-related unallocated costs that occurred in 2015. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA margins increased to 36.9% in 2016 from 34.6% in 2015.\nFINANCIAL POSITION\nLiquidity and capital resources\nOur strong cash generation capability and financial condition, together with our significant borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement, are sufficient to fund our capital expenditures, interest, dividends, share repurchases, investments in strategic initiatives and other operating requirements. Over the longer term, we expect to continue to fund debt maturities, acquisitions and investments through a combination of cash flows from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit agreement and funds raised in the capital markets.\nOur strong operating cash flows enabled our Board of Directors to approve two key capital allocation initiatives following the spin-off of our publishing businesses in 2015. First, we began paying a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.14 per share. We paid dividends totaling $122 million in 2016 and $168 million in 2015 (excluding the special spin-off distribution of our publishing businesses). Second, in 2015, our Board of Directors also approved an $825 million share repurchase program to be completed over a three-year period ending June 2018. See the Capital stock\u201d section below for more information on the share repurchase program.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our total long-term debt was $4.04 billion. Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2016 totaled $77 million.\nOur operations have historically generated strong positive cash flow which, along with bank revolving credit availability, has provided adequate liquidity to meet our internal investment requirements, as well as acquisitions. Our financial and operating performance, as well as our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to maintain compliance with credit facility covenants, are subject to certain risk factors; see Item 1A - Risk Factors for further discussion.\nThe following table provides a summary of our cash flow information followed by a discussion of the key elements of our cash flows:\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In millions of dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>469\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Net income\n</td> <td>488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Non-cash adjustments\n</td> <td>291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(163\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Changes in working capital\n</td> <td>(61\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(65\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(123\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Other, net\n</td> <td>(34\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flows from operating activities\n</td> <td>683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>848\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used for) provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>(273\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,662\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used for) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>(462\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(858\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>464\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>(52\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(351\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents at end of year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNote: Numbers may not sum due to rounding.\nOperating Activities\n2016 compared to 2015: Our net cash flow from operating activities was $683 million in 2016, compared to $651 million in 2015. Operating cash flow in 2016 increased due to the absence of any pension contributions to our principal retirement plan (we made a $100 million contribution in 2015). In addition, operating cash flow increased due to higher revenue in 2016. Partially offsetting these increases in cash flow from operating activities was a $101 million increase in income tax payments (due to higher taxable income), and the absence of our former publishing businesses which generated approximately $27 million of operating cash flow in the first half of 2015 (through the spin-off date of June 29, 2015).\n2015 compared to 2014: Our net cash flow from operating activities was $651 million in 2015 compared to $848 million in 2014. The decrease was due to the relative absence of $200 million of political and Olympic revenue achieved in 2014, the absence of our publishing businesses in the third and fourth quarters of 2015, a $23 million increase in pension payments in 2015, the timing of certain reverse network compensation payments, payments related to previously accrued expenses for the shutdown of USA Weekend and routine changes in working capital. The increase in pension payments in 2015 was primarily due to a $100 million voluntary contribution we made in 2015 to our principal retirement plan prior to the spin-off of our publishing businesses. Cash paid for income taxes were lower in 2015 by $101 million compared to 2014, primarily due to the tax benefit received on the voluntary pension payment and the decrease in net income compared to the prior year.\nInvesting Activities\n2016 compared to 2015: Net cash used by investing activities was $273 million in 2016 compared to cash provided by investing activities of $217 million in 2015. The difference between periods was primarily attributable to proceeds received in 2015 of $411 million related to sales of assets (primarily the sales of our corporate headquarters and Seattle broadcast buildings) and the sale of businesses (primarily Gannett Healthcare, Clipper and PointRoll). The year over year change was also attributable to the increase in cash paid for acquisitions from $54 million in 2015 to $206 million in 2016 (which includes DealerRater, Aurico, and Workterra - see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements).\n2015 compared to 2014: Net cash provided by investing activities was $217 million for 2015 compared to cash used by investing activities of $1.66 billion in 2014. In 2015, we received proceeds of $411 million related to sales of assets and the sale of businesses. This compares to payments for acquisitions of approximately $1.99 billion (primarily Cars.com, London Broadcasting and Broadbean) in 2014. Capital expenditures amounted to $119 million in 2015 and $150 million in 2014.\nFinancing Activities\n2016 compared to 2015: Net cash used for financing activities was $462 million in 2016 compared to $858 million in 2015. The difference between periods is primarily due to 2016 decreases in: debt repayments of $170 million; repurchases of our common stock of $109 million; and a one-time cash transfer in 2015 of $63 million to our former publishing businesses in connection with the spin-off.\n2015 compared to 2014: Net cash used for financing activities was $858 million in 2015 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $464 million in 2014. The difference between periods is primarily due to receiving less proceeds from the issuance of debt, increased repurchases of our common stock in 2015, increased debt repayments in 2015, and a one-time cash transfer in 2015 of $63 million to our former publishing businesses in connection with the Gannett spin-off.\nLong-term debt\nAs of December 31, 2016, our outstanding debt, net of unamortized discounts and deferred financing costs, amounted to $4.04 billion and mainly is in the form of fixed rate notes and borrowings under a revolving credit facility. See Note 7 Long-term debt\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for a table summarizing the components of our long-term debt. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our debt and credit agreements.\nBelow is a summary of our 2016 debt activity:\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On April 1, 2016 our unsecured notes bearing a fixed rate of 10% became due, and therefore, we made a debt maturity payment of approximately $203 million (comprised of principal and accrued interest).

As a result, the maximum total leverage ratio permitted by the new agreement is 5.0x through June 30, 2017, after which, as amended, it is reduced to 4.75x through June 30, 2018, and then to 4.50x thereafter. Commitment fees on the revolving credit agreement are equal to 0.25% - 0.40% of the undrawn commitments, depending upon our leverage ratio, and are computed on the average daily undrawn balance under the revolving credit agreement and paid each quarter. Under the Amended and Restated Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Agreement, we may borrow at an applicable margin above the Eurodollar base rate (LIBOR loan) or the higher of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50%, or the one month LIBOR rate plus 1.00% (ABR loan). The applicable margin is determined based on our leverage ratio but differs between LIBOR loans and ABR loans. For LIBOR-based borrowing, the margin varies from 1.75% to 2.50%. For ABR-based borrowing, the margin will vary from 0.75% to 1.50%. On September 26, 2016, we amended the Amended and Restated Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Agreement to increase the capacity of the facility by $103 million. Total commitments under the Amended and Restated Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Agreement are $1.5 billion.\nWe also have an effective shelf registration statement under which an unspecified amount of securities may be issued, subject to a $7.0 billion limit established by the Board of Directors. Proceeds from the sale of such securities may be used for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures, working capital, securities repurchase programs, repayment of debt and financing of acquisitions. We may also invest borrowed funds that are not required for other purposes in short-term marketable securities.\nOur debt maturities may be repaid with cash flow from operating activities, by accessing capital markets or a combination of both. The following schedule of annual maturities of the principal amount of total debt assumes we use available capacity under our revolving credit agreement to refinance unsecured floating rate term loans and fixed rate notes due in 2017 through 2018. Based on this refinancing assumption, all of the obligations other than the VIE unsecured floating rate term loan due prior to 2019 are reflected as maturities for 2019 and beyond.\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In thousands of dollars\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017 (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>646\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 (1)\n</td> <td>646\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>700,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 (2)\n</td> <td>1,612,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021\n</td> <td>350,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>1,415,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,078,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Amortization of term debt due in 2017 and 2018 is assumed to be repaid with funds from the revolving credit agreement, which matures in 2020.

Therefore, approximately $17 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of income taxes.\nCapital stock\nIn 2015, our Board of Directors approved an $825 million share repurchase program to be completed over a three-year period ending June 2018. As of December 31, 2016, we have $467 million remaining under this authorization. The table below summarizes our share repurchases during the past three years.\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock repurchases\n</td> <td>Repurchases made in fiscal year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In millions\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of shares purchased\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollar amount purchased\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe shares may be repurchased at management's discretion, either in the open market or in privately negotiated block transactions. Management's decision to repurchase shares will depend on price and other corporate developments. In connection with our announcement to spin-off our Cars.com business unit, we temporarily suspended repurchasing shares starting in July 2016 through early November 2016. Purchases may occur from time to time and no maximum purchase price has been set. Certain of the shares we previously acquired have been reissued in settlement of employee stock awards.\nOur common stock outstanding at December 31, 2016, totaled 214,487,800 shares, compared with 219,754,180 shares at December 31, 2015.\nEffects of inflation and changing prices and other matters\nOur results of operations and financial condition have not been significantly affected by inflation. The effects of inflation and changing prices on our property and equipment and related depreciation expense have been reduced as a result of an ongoing capital expenditure program and the availability of replacement assets with improved technology and efficiency.\nWe are minimally exposed to foreign exchange rate risk primarily due to our majority ownership of CareerBuilder which uses several currencies but primarily the Canadian Dollar, British Pound Sterling and Euro as its functional currencies, which are then translated into U.S. dollars. Our foreign currency translation adjustment, related principally to CareerBuilder and reported as part of shareholders' equity, totaled $29 million at December 31, 2016.\nCritical accounting policies and the use of estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. We believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most subjective and complex judgments. This commentary should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, selected financial data and the remainder of this Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition: We generate revenue from a diverse set of product and service offerings which include advertising, retransmission consent fees, and software and recruitment services. Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, performance under the contract has begun, the contract price is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the related transaction price is reasonably assured. Revenue from sales agreements that contain multiple deliverables is allocated to each element based on the relative best estimate of selling price. Elements are treated as separate units of accounting if there is standalone value upon delivery. Amounts received from customers in advance of revenue recognition are deferred as liabilities. Below is a detail discussion of revenue by our two reportable segments.\nMedia Segment: The primary source of revenue for our Media Segment is through the sale of advertising time on its television stations. Advertising revenues are recognized, net of agency commissions, in the period when the advertisements are aired. Our Media Segment also earns revenue from retransmission consent arrangements. Under these agreements, we receive cash consideration from multichannel video programming distributors (e.g., cable and satellite providers) in return for our consent to permit the cable/satellite operator to retransmit our television signal. Retransmission consent fees are recognized over the contract period based on a negotiated fee per subscriber. Retransmission consent fee revenues have increased as a percentage of overall Media Segment revenue in recent years. In 2016, those revenues accounted for approximately 30% of overall Media Segment revenue compared to 18% in 2013. In addition, our Media Segment also generates online advertising revenue through the display of digital advertisements across its various digital platforms. Online advertising agreements typically take the form of an impression-based contract, fixed fee time-based contract or transaction based contract. The customers are billed for impressions delivered or click-throughs on their advertisements. An impression is the display of an advertisement to an end-user on the website and is a measure of volume. A click-through occurs when an end-user clicks on an impression. Revenue is recognized evenly over the contract term for fixed fee contracts where a minimum number of impressions or click-throughs is not guaranteed. Revenue is recognized as the service is delivered for transaction-based contracts.\nDigital Segment: The primary source of revenue for our Digital Segment is through the sale of online subscription advertising products. Cars.com sells subscription advertising products to car dealerships, and CareerBuilder earns revenue through various types of recruitment subscription products. The transaction price for the subscription products is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term as the service is provided to our customers.\nRevenue is recognized for our Digital Segment's online display advertising arrangements (which includes Cars.com, CareerBuilder and G/O Digital) in the same manner as described above for Media Segments online advertising revenue.\nCareerBuilder service offerings include human capital SaaS and various other recruitment solutions (employment branding services and access to online resume databases). Generally, the human capital SaaS offering and access related to resume databases are subscription-based contracts for which revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period. SaaS contracts are generally two to three year contracts. Recruitment solutions (which include sourcing and screening services) are more transactional based contracts; and therefore, revenue is recognized as delivery occurs.\nGoodwill: As of December 31, 2016, our goodwill balance was $4.07 billion and represented approximately 48% of our total assets. Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, net of liabilities assumed. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis (first day of our fourth quarter) or between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances occurred that indicate the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying amount.\nOur goodwill has been allocated to and is tested for impairment at a level referred to as the reporting unit. The level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires us to determine whether the operations below the business segment level constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results. For Media, goodwill is tested at the segment level. For Digital, the reporting units are the stand-alone digital businesses such as Cars.com and CareerBuilder. The following table shows the aggregate goodwill balance for these units summarized at the segment level:\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In millions of dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment\n</td> <td>Goodwill Balance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Media\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Digital\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBefore performing the annual two-step goodwill impairment test, we first have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the two-step quantitative test must be completed. The qualitative assessment considers events and circumstances such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors and overall financial performance, as well as company and specific reporting unit specifications. If after performing this assessment, we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we are required to perform a two-step quantitative test. Otherwise, the two-step test is not required. In 2016, we elected not to perform the optional qualitative assessment of goodwill and instead performed the quantitative impairment test.\nWhen performing the first step of the quantitative test, we determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, we perform the second step of the impairment test, as this is an indication that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired. In the second step of the impairment test, we determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then an impairment of goodwill has occurred and we must recognize an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the implied fair value of goodwill.\nWe estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of an income approach using the discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and a market-based valuation methodology using comparable public company trading values. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are based on our best estimate of future sales, earnings and cash flows after considering factors such as general market conditions and recent operating performance. The discount rates utilized in the DCF analysis are based on the respective reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the relative weights of each component of its capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the respective reporting unit.\nDuring the third quarter of 2016, we performed an interim impairment test for a small reporting unit within our Digital Segment, and as a result recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $15.2 million within asset impairment and facility consolidation charges (gains) in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2016, we completed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units. The results of these tests indicated that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values.\nFor the Media Segment, a single reporting unit, the estimated value would need to decline by over 40% to fail step one of the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The Digital Segment balance represents primarily Cars.com and CareerBuilder. For both of these reporting units, the estimated value would need to decline by more than 20% to fail step one of the quantitative goodwill impairment test. We do not believe that any of our reporting units are currently at risk of incurring a goodwill impairment in the foreseeable future.\nImpairment assessment inherently involves management judgments regarding a number of assumptions described above. Fair value of the reporting units also depends on the future strength of the economy in our principal media and digital markets. New and developing competition as well as technological change could also adversely affect future fair value estimates. Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit's fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions could have a material effect on the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period.\nIndefinite Lived Intangibles: This asset grouping consists of FCC broadcast licenses related to our acquisitions of television stations, and trade names from the Cars.com and CareerBuilder acquisitions. As of December 31, 2016, indefinite lived intangible assets were $2.12 billion and represented approximately 25% of our total assets.\nIndefinite lived assets are not subject to amortization and, as a result, they are tested for impairment annually (on the first day of our fourth quarter), or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances suggest that the asset might be impaired. We have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived asset is more than its carrying amount. If that is the case, then we would not have to perform the quantitative analysis. The qualitative assessment considers events and circumstances such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors and overall financial performance of the indefinite lived asset. In 2016, we elected not to perform the optional qualitative assessment; and instead, we performed the quantitative impairment test.\nThe fair value of each FCC broadcast license was determined using an income approach referred to as the Greenfield method. This method requires multiple assumptions relating to the future prospects of each individual television station including, but not limited to: (i) expected long-term market growth characteristics, (ii) station revenue shares within a market for a new entrant, (iii) future expected operating expenses, (iv) costs of capital and (v) appropriate discount rates. We performed a quantitative analysis on all of our FCC licenses on the impairment testing date and each fair value exceeded the carrying value by more than 30%, and therefore, concluded that no impairment existed.\nWe completed our acquisition of Belo in late 2013 and London Broadcasting in mid-2014 and as a result recorded FCC licenses for all stations acquired. As these FCC licenses were recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition, any future declines in the fair value of the FCC license could result in an impairment charge. Factors that could cause the fair value to decline would be negative changes in any of the assumptions described in the above Greenfield method. The discount rate used generally has a significant impact to the valuation. For our 2016 impairment testing date, the discount rate had declined from when we completed our acquisition of Belo and London Broadcasting (2.0% for Belo and 1.5% for London Broadcasting). Future increases in the discount rate assumptions could cause a decline in the fair value of our FCC licenses which may result in an impairment charge.\nThe estimates of fair value for the trade names are determined using the relief from royalty\u201d methodology, which is a variation of the income approach. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows generated by the intangible asset. Also subject to judgment are assumptions about royalty rates, which are based on the estimated rates at which similar trade names are being licensed in the marketplace. We completed our annual impairment testing of trade names and determined each fair value exceeded the carrying value by more than 10%, and therefore, concluded that no impairments existed. Although our trade name assets are not currently impaired, changes in future market rates or decreases in future cash flows and growth rates could result in an impairment charge in a future period.\nOther Long-Lived Assets (Property and Equipment and Amortizable Intangible Assets): As of December 31, 2016, other long-lived assets were $1.3 billion and represented approximately 16% of our total assets. Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of such assets. Changes in circumstances, such as technological advances or changes to our business model or capital strategy, could result in actual useful lives differing from our estimates. In cases where we determine the useful life of buildings and equipment should be shortened, we would, after evaluating for impairment, depreciate the asset over its revised remaining useful life thereby increasing depreciation expense.\nIf an indicator is present, we review our property and equipment assets for potential impairment at the asset group level (generally at the local business level) by comparing the carrying value of such assets with the expected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by those asset groups/local business units. Due to expected continued cash flow in excess of carrying value from its businesses, no property or equipment assets were considered impaired.\nOur amortizable intangible assets consist mainly of customer relationships, acquired technology and retransmission agreements. These asset values are amortized ratably over their estimated useful lives. An impairment test of these assets would be triggered if the undiscounted cash flows from the related asset group (business unit) were to be less than the asset carrying value.\nWe do not believe that any of our larger amortizable intangible assets (those with book values over $10 million) are at risk of requiring an impairment in the foreseeable future.\nIncome Taxes: Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates, and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions.\nTax law requires certain items to be included in our tax returns at different times than when the items are reflected in the financial statements. The annual tax expense reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income is different than that reported in our tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent (for example, expenses recorded for accounting purposes that are not deductible in the returns such as non-deductible goodwill) and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts we believe are more likely than not to be recovered. In evaluating the amount of any such valuation allowance, we consider the existence of cumulative income or losses in recent years, the reversal of existing temporary differences, the existence of taxable income in prior carry back years, available tax planning strategies and estimates of future taxable income for each of our taxable jurisdictions. The latter two factors involve the exercise of significant judgment. As of December 31, 2016, deferred tax asset valuation allowances totaled $210 million,\nprimarily related to federal and state capital losses, and state net operating losses available for carry forward to future years. Although realization is not assured, we believe it is more likely than not that all other deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowances have been established will be realized. This conclusion is based on our history of cumulative income in recent years and review of historical and projected future taxable income.\nWe determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the benefit is recorded in our financial statements. A tax position is measured as the portion of the tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with a taxing authority (that has full knowledge of all relevant information). We may be required to change our provision for income taxes when the ultimate treatment of certain items is challenged or agreed to by taxing authorities, when estimates used in determining valuation allowances on deferred tax assets significantly change, or when receipt of new information indicates the need for adjustment in valuation allowances. Future events, such as changes in tax laws, tax regulations, or interpretations of such laws or regulations, could have an impact on the provision for income tax and the effective tax rate. Any such changes could significantly affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements in the year these changes occur.", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I am unable to comprehend the table you've provided me with.\n- It appears to be a table of text fragments, but I am unable to identify any patterns or relationships between the fragments.\n- Could you please provide me with some context or additional information about the table to assist me in better understanding it?\n\nI am happy to attempt to extract information from your table if you provide me with some context.", "item_7_tables": "Table 25: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In millions of dollars\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Media\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1%)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Digital\n</td> <td>1,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3%\n</td> <td>1,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47%\n</td> <td>934\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3%)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>955\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and admin. expenses\n</td> <td>1,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2%\n</td> <td>1,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39%\n</td> <td>767\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1%)\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6%\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td>115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1%\n</td> <td>114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73%\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairment and facility consolidation charges (gains)\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>***\n</td> <td>(59\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>***\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>707\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-operating expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(260\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(10%)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(290\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>***\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>283\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14%)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>234\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(51\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(19%)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(63\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(7%)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(68\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48%)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>688\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from continuing operations per share -

Our media business includes 46 television stations operating in 38 markets, offering high-quality television programming and digital content. Our digital business primarily consists of our Cars.com and CareerBuilder business units that operate in the automotive and human capital solutions industries. Cars.com is a leading online destination for automotive consumers offering credible, objective information about car shopping, selling and servicing. CareerBuilder helps companies target, attract and retain workforce talent through an array of product offerings including talent management software and other advertising and recruitment solutions.\nOn September 7, 2016, we announced our intention to spin-off the Cars.com business unit into a separate stand-alone public company and we also announced our plans to conduct a strategic review of our 53% ownership interest in CareerBuilder. While we perform the necessary steps to complete the spin and strategic review, we will maintain the current operating and reporting structure and will continue to report the financial results of both entities in continuing operations within our Digital Segment.\nFiscal year: Beginning in fiscal year 2015, we changed our financial reporting cycle to a calendar year-end. Accordingly, our 2015 fiscal year began on December 29, 2014 (the day after the end of the 2014 fiscal year) and ended on December 31, 2015. Historically, our fiscal year was a 52-53 week fiscal year that ended on the last Sunday of the calendar year. As a result, our 2015 fiscal year had two more days than fiscal year 2016. The impact of the extra days in 2015 did not have a material impact on our financial statements; and therefore, we have not restated the historical results.\nConsolidated Results from Operations\nA consolidated summary of our results is presented below.\n\nConsolidated Operating Revenue\nOperating revenues increased $290 million, or 10%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. This increase is comprised of a $252 million increase from our Media Segment and a $39 million increase at our Digital Segment. Record Media Segment revenues of $1.93 billion were driven by political advertising revenue of $155 million, record Summer Olympics revenue of $56 million in the third quarter of 2016, and a substantial increase of retransmission revenue of $133 million and online revenue of $13 million. These increases were partially offset by a $20 million decrease in core advertising due in part to election year political displacement. Increases in the Digital Segment were driven by continued revenue growth at Cars.com of $37 million, G/O Digital of $28 million and CareerBuilder of $16 million. These increases at the Digital Segment were partially offset by the absence of $32 million of revenue contributed in 2015 by our PointRoll business, which was sold in November 2015.\nOperating revenues increased $425 million, or 16%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. This increase comprised a $435 million increase from our Digital Segment, partially offset by a $10 million decline at our Media Segment. Media Segment revenues for 2015 decreased 1% to $1.68 billion, as growth in retransmission revenue of $87 million, online revenue of $15 million, and higher core revenue of $26 million were offset by a decline of political advertising revenue of $138 million (from the record level of political advertising revenue of $159 million achieved in 2014). Digital Segment revenues totaled $1.37 billion for 2015, an increase of 47%. The increase reflects the impact of the Cars.com acquisition (acquired on October 1, 2014) as well as the strong organic growth of Cars.com revenue, as well as price increases for affiliates implemented October 1, 2014, resulting in an increase in revenue of $451 million in 2015. Partially offsetting the revenue increase at Cars.com, was a decrease of $20 million as a result of a decline in revenue and sale of our PointRoll business in November 2015.\nCosts of Revenue\nCost of revenue increased $116 million, or 13%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. This increase was primarily due to an $89 million increase in programming costs incurred by the Media Segment. In addition, our 2016 business acquisitions contributed $17 million to the increase, and cost increases at Cars.com added $11 million to our cost of revenue (primarily due to higher traffic acquisition costs and increased compensation costs).\nCost of revenue decreased $32 million, or 3%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. This decrease was due to a $25 million decrease at CareerBuilder primarily due to the expiration and non-renewal of certain revenue-share arrangements.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses increased $26 million, or 2%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase was primarily driven by the 2016 business acquisitions of Aurico, DealerRater, and Workterra, which increased selling, general, and administrative expenses by $18 million. In addition, severance expense increased $9 million year-over-year driven by a voluntary retirement program in our Media Segment completed in 2016. Our 2016 expenses also increased due to the absence of rental income at our corporate headquarters, which was $5 million in 2015, resulting from our sale of the building in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses increased $301 million, or 39%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. The majority of the increase was due to the October 2014 acquisition of the remaining ownership of Cars.com which resulted in a year over year increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $217 million.\nDepreciation Expense\nDepreciation expense decreased $1 million, or 1%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. This decrease is primarily due to a $5 million decline in depreciation at Corporate, primarily driven by the October 2015 sale of our corporate headquarters building that resulted in a year-over-year decrease in depreciation expense of $4 million. The decrease was also driven by the sale of our PointRoll business in November 2015, which led to a year-over-year decline in depreciation expense of $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by a $5 million increase in CareerBuilder's depreciation, which was due to the acquisition of new computer equipment, an increase in internally developed software and new leasehold improvements.\nDepreciation expense increased $5 million, or 6%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. The increase was due to the acquisition of Cars.com in October 2014 which resulted in a year over year increase in depreciation expense of $6 million.\nIntangible Asset Amortization Expense\nIntangible asset amortization expense increased by less than $1 million, or less than 1%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase was primarily driven by the 2016 acquisitions, which was substantially offset by a decline in amortization expense associated with previous acquisitions as a result of reaching the end of their useful lives.\nIntangible asset amortization expense increased $48 million, or 73%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. The October 2014 acquisition of Cars.com resulted in amortization expense in 2015 and 2014 of $73 million and $18 million, respectively. This increase was partially offset by a $7 million reduction in amortization expense related to certain intangible assets in 2015 as a result of reaching the end of their useful lives.\nAsset impairment and Facility Consolidation Charges (Gains)\nAsset impairment and facility consolidation charges (gains) fluctuated $91 million from a gain of ($59) million in 2015 to a charge of $32 million in 2016. The fluctuation was mainly due to the absence of the $90 million net gain from the sale of our corporate headquarters building in 2015. The 2016 charges were comprised of a goodwill impairment charge of $15 million incurred in the third quarter of 2016, a $6 million impairment related to a programming asset, a $5 million impairment charge related to a long-lived-asset, and a $5 million lease related charge.\nAsset impairment and facility consolidation charges (gains) fluctuated $104 million from charges of $45 million in 2014 to a gain of ($59) million in 2015. The year-over-year fluctuation was driven by the $90 million net gain from the sale of our corporate headquarters building in 2015, and by non-cash impairment charges of $31 million in 2014 related to certain reporting units within our Digital Segment (primarily PointRoll, ShopLocal and BLiNQ).\nOperating Income\nOperating income increased $59 million, or 6%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase was driven by the changes in revenue and operating expenses described above. Further, the increase in 2016 was partially offset by the absence of the $90 million gain on the sale of our corporate headquarters building in 2015. Our consolidated operating margins were lower at 29% in 2016 compared to 30% in 2015, primarily driven by the absence in 2016 of the net gain on the sale of our corporate headquarters building reported in 2015.\nOperating income increased $206 million, or 29%, in 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily driven by the acquisition of Cars.com which contributed $180 million of the increase. Our consolidated operating margins improved to 30% in 2015 compared to 27% in 2014 driven by improvement in margins from our Digital Segment as well as the net gain on the sale of our corporate headquarters building, partially offset by the impact from the absence of Winter Olympics and political spending in 2014.\nPayroll expense trends: Payroll expense is the largest element of our normal operating expenses, and is summarized below, expressed as a percentage of total pre-tax operating expenses. Payroll expense as a percentage of total pre-tax operating expenses decreased in 2016, reflecting that total operating expenses grew at a faster rate than payroll expense. \nNon-operating income and expense\nEquity earnings (losses): This income statement category reflects earnings or losses from our equity method investments. Equity losses increased $2 million, or 42% in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increased losses were primarily due to ($4 million) of impairment charges related to two equity method investments recorded in 2016. These impairment losses were partially offset by a year over year improvement in results for other equity method investments.\nEquity earnings (losses) fluctuated $156 million from a $151 million gain in 2014 to a ($5 million) loss in 2015. This fluctuation was primarily due to the absence of a $148 million gain on the sale of Apartments.com by Classified Ventures in 2014.\nInterest expense: Interest expense decreased $42 million, or 15%, in 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to lower average outstanding total debt balance and a lower average interest rate, reflecting the extinguishment of higher cost debt in 2015 and 2016, including the 10% senior notes and 7.125% notes that we repaid in April and November of 2016, respectively. The total average outstanding debt was $4.25 billion in 2016 compared to $4.37 billion in 2015. The weighted average interest rate on total outstanding debt was 5.29% in 2016, compared to 5.98% in 2015.\nInterest expense increased $1 million, or less than 1%, in 2015 as compared to 2014, due to a higher average debt level of $4.37 billion in 2015 compared to $3.85 billion in 2014. The higher average debt level was related to additional borrowing related to both the Belo and Cars.com acquisitions in 2013 and 2014, respectively, partly offset by a lower average interest rate. The weighted average interest rate on total outstanding debt was 5.98% in 2015, compared to 6.65% in 2014.\nA further discussion of our borrowing and related interest cost is presented in the Liquidity and capital resources\u201d section of this report beginning on page 26 and in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.\nOther non-operating items: Other non-operating items fluctuated $9 million from a loss of $12 million in 2015 to a loss of $20 million in 2016. The 2016 non-operating loss primarily consisted of $24 million in costs associated with the spin-off of our Cars.com business unit, the strategic review of CareerBuilder, and acquisition related costs. Our 2015 non-operating loss consisted of $45 million in costs related to the spin-off of our former publishing business and $9 million in costs incurred in connection with the early extinguishment of debt. These costs in 2015 were offset by a gain of $44 million on the sale of a business.\nOther non-operating items in 2014 represented a net gain of $404 million, with the majority related to the write-up of our prior 27% investment in Cars.com to fair value post-acquisition and a gain related to required accounting for the pre-existing affiliate agreement between Cars.com and us. This gain was partially offset by acquisition costs and expenses incurred for the spin-off of our publishing businesses completed in 2015.\nProvision for income taxes\nWe reported pre-tax income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA of $661 million for 2016. The effective tax rate on pre-tax income was 32.8%.\nWe reported pre-tax income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA of $560 million for 2015. The effective tax rate on pre-tax income was 36.1%.\nThe 2016 effective tax rate decreased as compared to 2015 primarily due to a decrease in TEGNA's state effective tax rate applied to our deferred tax items. This reduction of our state effective tax rate was driven by various tax planning initiatives, in particular a state income tax project that was concluded in the fourth quarter of 2016. When these tax items are reported on our future state tax returns, they will be subject to a lower tax rate than had been recorded previously, which created a deferred tax benefit in 2016 that reduced our effective tax rate. In addition, in the first quarter of 2016 we early adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) guidance on employee share-based payments that requires all excess tax benefits and tax deduction shortfalls to be recognized as an income tax benefit or expense in the income statement. As a result in 2016, we realized an excess tax benefit with respect to our employee share-based payments, which reduced our effective tax rate by 1% as compared to 2015. This FASB guidance will continue to apply in the future; however, among other factors, the amount of the income tax benefit or expense will be dependent on our future stock price, which cannot be accurately predicted.\nWe reported pre-tax income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA of $922 million for 2014. The provision for income taxes reflects a special net tax benefit from the sale of a non-strategic subsidiary at a loss, for which a partial tax benefit was recognized. The effective tax rate in 2014 was 25.4%.\nFurther information concerning income tax matters is contained in Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements.\nNet income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA Inc.\nNet income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA Inc. and related per share amounts are presented in the table below.\n\nNet income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA Inc. consists of net income from continuing operations reduced by net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, from CareerBuilder and its subsidiaries. We reported net income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA of $444 million or $2.02 per diluted share for 2016 compared to $357 million or $1.56 per diluted share for 2015.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $51 million in 2016, $63 million in 2015 and $68 million in 2014.\nEarnings per share benefited from a net decrease of approximately ten million diluted shares from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016, and approximately two million dilutive shares from December 31, 2014, to December 31, 2015, as a result of share repurchases, which were partially offset by share issuances under our stock-based award programs.\nOutlook for 2017: Based on current trends, we expect Media Segment revenue in the first quarter of 2017 to be flat to slightly above the first quarter of 2016. The year-over-year comparison will be unfavorably impacted by substantially lower political advertising revenue ($16 million in the first quarter of 2016) and the move of the Super Bowl to our 3 small FOX stations in 2017 from our 11 CBS stations in 2016. Excluding the unfavorable impact of the Super Bowl shift (approximately $9 million) and lower politically-related advertising, the percentage increase in Media Segment revenues is expected to be in the mid-single digits in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016.\nIn addition, beginning in January 2017, 11 of our NBC stations will be making reverse compensation payments for the first time. As such, 2017 will be a unique year as there will be an unfavorable gap between the increase in retransmission revenue we earn from multichannel video programming distributors (MVPD), compared to the increase in reverse compensation we will pay our affiliates. At the end of 2016, we renegotiated several new retransmission agreements with major MVPD carriers, and as a result, we have reduced our net retransmission gap in 2017 to approximately $25 million to $30 million. Further, we expect our strategic initiatives launched in 2016 (as discussed in our Media Segment section within Item 1 Business) will more than offset the remaining net retransmission gap in 2017.\nFor Cars.com, we are expecting modest single-digit revenue growth in the first quarter of 2017. We expect to see revenue growth in Cars.com national and major accounts businesses, but at a lower rate than during the same quarter last year primarily related to reduction in spending at two national accounts due to a transition to an advertising agency and a change in placement strategy during the first quarter. Once these transitions are completed, we expect these two\nnational accounts to increase their spending as we progress throughout the year.\nExcluding the impact of these two accounts, we expect Cars.com national and major accounts to be up in the range of 12% to 15% in the first quarter of 2017. While Cars.com is taking steps to improve, and in some cases restructure, the relationships with our affiliates, we expect a mid single-digit revenue decline in the first quarter of 2017 for affiliate revenues.\nThe following is a discussion of operating results of our Media and Digital Segments:\nMedia Segment\nAt the end of 2016, our Media operations included 46 television stations either owned or serviced through shared service agreements or other similar agreements. Media Segment revenues accounted for approximately 58% of our consolidated operating revenues for 2016.\nA summary of our Media Segment results is presented below:\n\nMedia Segment revenues are grouped into five categories: Core (Local and National), Political, Retransmission, Digital and Other. The following table summarizes the year-over-year changes in these select revenue categories.\n\nMedia Segment results 2016-2015: Media Segment revenues increased $251 million, or 15%, to a record high in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase was driven by political advertising, a record level of Summer Olympics advertising, and a substantial increase in retransmission revenues. Core advertising revenues, which consist of local and national non-political advertising (and includes Olympics advertising), decreased $20 million or 2%, mostly due to: political advertising displacement; softer markets in the insurance and retail categories; and an $8 million impact related to two fewer days in 2016 as compared to 2015 as a result of the fiscal year-end change. These decreases were partially offset by a record $56 million Summer Olympics advertising revenue in the third quarter of 2016 which was up over 20% compared to the last Summer Olympics in 2012. Political advertising revenue increased $133 million due to the presidential election year political spending. Political revenues are cyclical and higher in even years (e.g. 2014, 2016). Retransmission revenues increased $133 million or 30% in 2016, reflecting retransmission agreements renewed at the end of last year, as well as annual rate increases for existing agreements. Digital revenues within our Media Segment increased $13 million or 12% primarily due to continued growth of digital marketing services products.\nMedia Segment operating expenses increased $159 million or 16% in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase was mainly due to an increase of $89 million in programming costs (primarily associated with reverse compensation to network affiliates related to retransmission revenue) as well as investments in growth initiatives, $19 million primarily related to severance charges incurred with the voluntary early retirement program and the absence of a $13 million building sale gain in the first quarter of 2015.\nAsset impairment charges recognized in 2016 primarily relate to a $6 million charge associated with an internally produced program and a $2 million impairment of a long-lived asset that is now classified as held for sale and was written down to its fair value in 2016.\nExcluding the impacts of the voluntary early retirement program expense and asset impairment charges in 2016 and the building sale gain in 2015, Media Segment operating expenses increased 14% in 2016.\nAs a result of all of these factors, Media Segment operating income increased to $806 million in 2016 from $714 million in 2015.\nMedia Segment results 2015-2014: Media Segment revenues decreased $10 million to $1.68 billion or 1% in 2015 as compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the absence of record level of political advertising revenue of $159 million and $41 million in Winter Olympics advertising revenue achieved during 2014. The change to a calendar year-end reporting cycle extended our fiscal 2015 by four extra days which increased Media Segment revenue by $11 million. Core advertising revenues increased $26 million or 3% in 2015. Political advertising revenue declined $138 million to $21 million in 2015. Retransmission revenues increased $87 million or 24% in 2015 resulting from newly negotiated agreements and annual rate increases. Within the Media Segment, digital revenue increased $15 million or 15% compared to 2014, reflecting continued growth from digital marketing services products.\nMedia Segment operating expenses increased $23 million or 2% in 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $22 million in programming costs as well as a $16 million increase in cost of digital initiatives, partially offset by a $13 million building sale gain in the first quarter of 2015.\nAs a result of all of these factors, Media Segment operating income decreased to $714 million in 2015 from $747 million in 2014.\nDigital Segment\nOur Digital Segment includes results for our stand-alone digital subsidiaries including Cars.com, CareerBuilder, G/O Digital and Cofactor (also operating as ShopLocal) business units. In December 2016, we sold our Cofactor business unit. In November 2015, we sold our PointRoll business unit which was previously part of Cofactor.\nMany of our other digital offerings are highly integrated within our Media Segment offerings; therefore, the results of these integrated digital offerings are reported within the operating results of our Media Segment.\nA summary of our Digital Segment results is presented below:\n\nNote: Numbers may not sum due to rounding.\nDigital Segment results 2016-2015: Our 2016 Digital Segment revenue was $1.41 billion, a record high. Digital Segment revenues increased $39 million, or 3%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase was driven by continued revenue growth at Cars.com of $37 million, or 6%, G/O Digital of $28 million or 94% (due to combination of a new commercial agreement which started in mid 2015 and organic growth) and CareerBuilder of $16 million, or 2%. These increases were partially offset by the sale of our former PointRoll business which contributed $32 million of revenue in 2015. The increase in Cars.com revenues was due to an increase in retail revenue (driven by increased subscription package volume and upsells and the acquisition of DealerRater) and higher national advertising purchased by auto manufacturers. The increase in CareerBuilder revenue was driven by $40 million of increases from employer services (driven by the acquisition of Aurico and higher revenue across sales channels due), $12 million of increased resume database revenues (due to sales and renewals of its new Recruitment Edge product) and $12 million from continued growth in software as a service (SaaS) revenues. These increases at CareerBuilder were partially offset by lower job site revenue of $48 million (due to lower job postings and competitive pricing pressure).\nDigital Segment expenses increased $38 million or 3% in 2016 as compared to 2015. This increase was driven by higher expenses at CareerBuilder of $47 million, primarily due to the acquisition of Aurico and Workterra. Also impacting the increase in 2016 was an increase in G/O Digital operating expenses of $24 million (due to a new commercial agreement which started in mid 2015) and an increase at Cars.com of $14 million (consistent with revenue growth). These increases are partially offset by the sale of our PointRoll business which resulted in a decline in operating expenses of $36 million, and the absence of $8 million of costs associated with our former BLiNQ business which was shut down in the second quarter of 2015.\nAs a result of these factors, Digital Segment operating income increased to $230 million in 2016.\nDigital Segment results 2015-2014: Digital Segment revenues increased $435 million, or 47%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. The increase was driven by the $451 million incremental full year impact of the Cars.com acquisition on October 1, 2014, partially offset by a decrease of revenues at CareerBuilder of $15 million, or 2%. The decrease in CareerBuilder revenues in 2015 was driven by the strategic shift in focus in its product offerings. During 2015, CareerBuilder continued its transition toward higher-margin software-as-a-service solutions, including its pre-hire platform and new recruitment software products. As a result, SaaS revenues increased $35 million, or 30%. These revenue increases were offset by declines from lower-margin, transactional source and screen arrangements and other transactional offerings totaling approximately $56 million, as CareerBuilder moved away from these product offerings to focus on the SaaS platform solutions. In addition, 2015 revenue increased $26 million due to G/O Digital (due to combination of a new commercial agreement which started in mid 2015 and organic growth), which was offset by 2015 declines in revenue of $24 million from various other digital business units (primarily PointRoll).\nDigital Segment expenses in 2015 increased $325 million, or 40%, primarily due to the $271 million incremental full year impact of the Cars.com acquisition and G/O Digital increase of $21 million (due to combination of a new commercial agreement in mid 2015 and organic growth). These increases were offset by a decrease in CareerBuilder expenses of $14 million, or 2%, (reflecting lower revenue and strategic shift in focus on its product offerings), and a $13 million reduction in expenses in the BLiNQ business, which was shut down in the second quarter of 2015.\nAs a result of these factors, Digital Segment operating income increased by $109 million or 91% in 2015.\nOperating results non-GAAP information\nPresentation of non-GAAP information: We use non-GAAP financial performance and liquidity measures to supplement the financial information presented on a GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the related GAAP measures, nor should they be considered superior to the related GAAP measures, and should be read together with financial information presented on a GAAP basis. Also, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nManagement and our Board of Directors use the non-GAAP financial measures for purposes of evaluating business unit and consolidated company performance. Furthermore, the Executive Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors uses non-GAAP measures such as Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow to evaluate management's performance. Therefore, we believe that each of the non-GAAP measures presented provides useful information to investors and other stakeholders by allowing them to view our business through the eyes of management and our Board of Directors, facilitating comparisons of results across historical periods and focus on the underlying ongoing operating performance of our business. We discuss in this Form 10-K non-GAAP financial performance measures that exclude from our reported GAAP results the impact of special items\u201d consisting of severance expense, impairment charges on operating assets and equity investments, facility consolidation charges, gains related to building sales, gains/losses related to business disposals, expenses related to business acquisitions, costs associated with the company's spin-off transactions, and benefits to our income tax provision. We also adjust net income attributed to noncontrolling interests to the extent any of the above items are related to our CareerBuilder business unit. We believe that such expenses, charges and gains are not indicative of normal, ongoing operations. Such items vary from period to period and are significantly impacted by the timing and nature of these events. Therefore, while we may incur or recognize these types of expenses, charges and gains in the future, we believe that removing these items for purposes of calculating the non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with a more focused presentation of our ongoing operating performance.\nWe discuss Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial performance measure that we believe offers a useful view of the overall operation of its businesses. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA before (1) net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, (2) interest expense, (3) income taxes, (4) equity income (losses) in unconsolidated investees, net, (5) other non-operating items such as spin-off transaction expense, investment income and currency gains and losses, (6) severance expense, (7) facility consolidation charges, (8) impairment charges, (9) depreciation and (10) amortization. When Adjusted EBITDA is discussed in reference to performance on a consolidated basis, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is Net income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA. We do not analyze non-operating items such as interest expense and income taxes on a segment level; therefore, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Adjusted EBITDA when performance is discussed on a segment level is Operating income. Users should consider the limitations of using Adjusted EBITDA, including the fact that this measure does not provide a complete measure of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to purport to be an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. In particular, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow available for management's discretionary expenditures, as this measure does not consider certain cash requirements, such as working capital needs, capital expenditures, contractual commitments, interest payments, tax payments and other debt service requirements.\nWe also discuss free cash flow, a non-GAAP liquidity measure (see Selected Financial Data on page 67). Free cash flow is defined as net cash flow from operating activities\u201d as reported on the statement of cash flows reduced by purchase of property and equipment\u201d. We believe that free cash flow is a useful measure for management and investors to evaluate the level of cash generated by operations and the ability of its operations to fund investments in new and existing businesses, return cash to shareholders under the company's capital program, repay indebtedness, add to our cash balance, or use in other discretionary activities. We use free cash flow to monitor cash available for repayment of indebtedness and in discussions with the investment community. Like Adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow is not intended to be a measure of cash flow available for management's discretionary use.\nDiscussion of special charges and credits affecting reported results: Our results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, included the following items we consider special items\u201d and are not indicative of our normal ongoing operations:\n \u2022 Severance charges primarily related to a voluntary retirement program at our Media Segment (which includes payroll and related benefit costs); \n \u2022 Non-cash asset impairment and facility consolidation charges primarily associated with goodwill, operating assets, and an operating lease; \n \u2022 Non-operating costs primarily associated with the anticipated spin-off of our Cars.com business unit, strategic review of CareerBuilder, acquisition related costs and equity method investment impairments; \n \u2022 Impact of special items on our net income attributable to noncontrolling interests; and \n \u2022 Special tax benefit related to the release of a portion of our capital loss valuation allowance due to the sale of certain deferred compensation plan investments.  Results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, included the following special items:\n \u2022 Costs associated with workforce restructuring; \n \u2022 Non-cash asset impairment and facility consolidation charges primarily related to reducing the carrying value of certain assets to fair value, a goodwill impairment charge, and shut down costs associated with our former BLiNQ business; \n \u2022 Gains on building sales, primarily from the sale of our corporate headquarters building; \n \u2022 Non-operating items related to the spin-off of our former publishing businesses, a gain related to the sale of Gannett Healthcare Group, and other miscellaneous non-operating expenses; and \n \u2022 Special tax benefit primarily related to the restructuring of our legal entities in advance of the spin-off of our publishing businesses. \nBelow are reconciliations of certain line items impacted by special items to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP on our Consolidated Statements of Income:\n\n\nNon-GAAP consolidated results\nThe following is a comparison of our as adjusted non-GAAP financial results between 2016 and 2015. Changes between the periods are driven by the same factors summarized above in the Results of Operations\u201d section within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA - Non-GAAP\nReconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to net income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA Inc. presented in accordance with GAAP on our Consolidated Statements of Income is presented below:\n\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $180 million or 17% to $1.23 billion in 2016 from $1.05 billion in 2015. The increase was driven by in an increase of $121 million or 15% in the Media Segment and the absence of $52 million in publishing-related unallocated costs that occurred in 2015. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA margins increased to 36.9% in 2016 from 34.6% in 2015.\nFINANCIAL POSITION\nLiquidity and capital resources\nOur strong cash generation capability and financial condition, together with our significant borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement, are sufficient to fund our capital expenditures, interest, dividends, share repurchases, investments in strategic initiatives and other operating requirements. Over the longer term, we expect to continue to fund debt maturities, acquisitions and investments through a combination of cash flows from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit agreement and funds raised in the capital markets.\nOur strong operating cash flows enabled our Board of Directors to approve two key capital allocation initiatives following the spin-off of our publishing businesses in 2015. First, we began paying a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.14 per share. We paid dividends totaling $122 million in 2016 and $168 million in 2015 (excluding the special spin-off distribution of our publishing businesses). Second, in 2015, our Board of Directors also approved an $825 million share repurchase program to be completed over a three-year period ending June 2018. See the Capital stock\u201d section below for more information on the share repurchase program.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our total long-term debt was $4.04 billion. Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2016 totaled $77 million.\nOur operations have historically generated strong positive cash flow which, along with bank revolving credit availability, has provided adequate liquidity to meet our internal investment requirements, as well as acquisitions. Our financial and operating performance, as well as our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to maintain compliance with credit facility covenants, are subject to certain risk factors; see Item 1A - Risk Factors for further discussion.\nThe following table provides a summary of our cash flow information followed by a discussion of the key elements of our cash flows:\n\nNote: Numbers may not sum due to rounding.\nOperating Activities\n2016 compared to 2015: Our net cash flow from operating activities was $683 million in 2016, compared to $651 million in 2015. Operating cash flow in 2016 increased due to the absence of any pension contributions to our principal retirement plan (we made a $100 million contribution in 2015). In addition, operating cash flow increased due to higher revenue in 2016. Partially offsetting these increases in cash flow from operating activities was a $101 million increase in income tax payments (due to higher taxable income), and the absence of our former publishing businesses which generated approximately $27 million of operating cash flow in the first half of 2015 (through the spin-off date of June 29, 2015).\n2015 compared to 2014: Our net cash flow from operating activities was $651 million in 2015 compared to $848 million in 2014. The decrease was due to the relative absence of $200 million of political and Olympic revenue achieved in 2014, the absence of our publishing businesses in the third and fourth quarters of 2015, a $23 million increase in pension payments in 2015, the timing of certain reverse network compensation payments, payments related to previously accrued expenses for the shutdown of USA Weekend and routine changes in working capital. The increase in pension payments in 2015 was primarily due to a $100 million voluntary contribution we made in 2015 to our principal retirement plan prior to the spin-off of our publishing businesses. Cash paid for income taxes were lower in 2015 by $101 million compared to 2014, primarily due to the tax benefit received on the voluntary pension payment and the decrease in net income compared to the prior year.\nInvesting Activities\n2016 compared to 2015: Net cash used by investing activities was $273 million in 2016 compared to cash provided by investing activities of $217 million in 2015. The difference between periods was primarily attributable to proceeds received in 2015 of $411 million related to sales of assets (primarily the sales of our corporate headquarters and Seattle broadcast buildings) and the sale of businesses (primarily Gannett Healthcare, Clipper and PointRoll). The year over year change was also attributable to the increase in cash paid for acquisitions from $54 million in 2015 to $206 million in 2016 (which includes DealerRater, Aurico, and Workterra - see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements).\n2015 compared to 2014: Net cash provided by investing activities was $217 million for 2015 compared to cash used by investing activities of $1.66 billion in 2014. In 2015, we received proceeds of $411 million related to sales of assets and the sale of businesses. This compares to payments for acquisitions of approximately $1.99 billion (primarily Cars.com, London Broadcasting and Broadbean) in 2014. Capital expenditures amounted to $119 million in 2015 and $150 million in 2014.\nFinancing Activities\n2016 compared to 2015: Net cash used for financing activities was $462 million in 2016 compared to $858 million in 2015. The difference between periods is primarily due to 2016 decreases in: debt repayments of $170 million; repurchases of our common stock of $109 million; and a one-time cash transfer in 2015 of $63 million to our former publishing businesses in connection with the spin-off.\n2015 compared to 2014: Net cash used for financing activities was $858 million in 2015 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $464 million in 2014. The difference between periods is primarily due to receiving less proceeds from the issuance of debt, increased repurchases of our common stock in 2015, increased debt repayments in 2015, and a one-time cash transfer in 2015 of $63 million to our former publishing businesses in connection with the Gannett spin-off.\nLong-term debt\nAs of December 31, 2016, our outstanding debt, net of unamortized discounts and deferred financing costs, amounted to $4.04 billion and mainly is in the form of fixed rate notes and borrowings under a revolving credit facility. See Note 7 Long-term debt\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for a table summarizing the components of our long-term debt. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our debt and credit agreements.\nBelow is a summary of our 2016 debt activity:\n \u2022 On April 1, 2016 our unsecured notes bearing a fixed rate of 10% became due, and therefore, we made a debt maturity payment of approximately $203 million (comprised of principal and accrued interest). The payment was made using borrowings from our revolving credit facility. \n \u2022 On September 30, 2016, we borrowed $300 million under a new four-year term loan due in 2020. The interest rate on the term loan is equal to the same interest rates as borrowings under the Amended and Restated Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Agreement discussed below. Both the revolving credit agreement and the term loan are guaranteed by a majority of our wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries. We used substantially all of the proceeds from the new term loan to repay a portion of the outstanding obligation under our revolving credit facility. \n \u2022 On November 1, 2016, we redeemed the remaining $70 million of 7.125% unsecured notes due in September 2018 at par, using available cash on hand. This redemption will result in a total net reduction of interest expense of approximately $5 million over the next two years. \n \u2022 As of December 31, 2016, we had unused borrowing capacity of $844 million under our revolving credit facility. \nIn 2015, we entered into an agreement to amend and extend our existing revolving credit facility with one expiring on June 29, 2020 (the Amended and Restated Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Agreement). As a result, the maximum total leverage ratio permitted by the new agreement is 5.0x through June 30, 2017, after which, as amended, it is reduced to 4.75x through June 30, 2018, and then to 4.50x thereafter. Commitment fees on the revolving credit agreement are equal to 0.25% - 0.40% of the undrawn commitments, depending upon our leverage ratio, and are computed on the average daily undrawn balance under the revolving credit agreement and paid each quarter. Under the Amended and Restated Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Agreement, we may borrow at an applicable margin above the Eurodollar base rate (LIBOR loan) or the higher of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50%, or the one month LIBOR rate plus 1.00% (ABR loan). The applicable margin is determined based on our leverage ratio but differs between LIBOR loans and ABR loans. For LIBOR-based borrowing, the margin varies from 1.75% to 2.50%. For ABR-based borrowing, the margin will vary from 0.75% to 1.50%. On September 26, 2016, we amended the Amended and Restated Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Agreement to increase the capacity of the facility by $103 million. Total commitments under the Amended and Restated Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Agreement are $1.5 billion.\nWe also have an effective shelf registration statement under which an unspecified amount of securities may be issued, subject to a $7.0 billion limit established by the Board of Directors. Proceeds from the sale of such securities may be used for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures, working capital, securities repurchase programs, repayment of debt and financing of acquisitions. We may also invest borrowed funds that are not required for other purposes in short-term marketable securities.\nOur debt maturities may be repaid with cash flow from operating activities, by accessing capital markets or a combination of both. The following schedule of annual maturities of the principal amount of total debt assumes we use available capacity under our revolving credit agreement to refinance unsecured floating rate term loans and fixed rate notes due in 2017 through 2018. Based on this refinancing assumption, all of the obligations other than the VIE unsecured floating rate term loan due prior to 2019 are reflected as maturities for 2019 and beyond.\n\n(1) Amortization of term debt due in 2017 and 2018 is assumed to be repaid with funds from the revolving credit agreement, which matures in 2020. Excluding our ability to repay funds with the revolving credit agreement, contractual debt maturities are $132 million and $121 million in 2017 and 2018, respectively.\n(2) Assumes current revolving credit agreement borrowings comes due in 2020 and credit facility is not extended.\nContractual obligations and commitments\nThe following table summarizes the expected cash outflows resulting from financial contracts and commitments as of the end of 2016.\n\n (1) Long-term debt includes scheduled principal payments only. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. \n (2) We have $635 million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of Dec. 31, 2016. We have not included estimated interest payments since payments into and out of the credit facility change daily. Interest on the senior notes is based on the stated cash coupon rate and excludes the amortization of debt issuance discount. The term loan interest rates are based on the actual rates as of Dec. 31, 2016. \n (3) See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. \n (4) Includes purchase obligations related to capital projects, interactive marketing agreements and other legally binding commitments. Amounts which we are liable for under purchase orders outstanding at Dec. 31, 2016, are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as accounts payable and accrued liabilities and are excluded from the table above. \n (5) Programming contracts include television station commitments to purchase programming to be produced in future years. This also includes amounts related to our network affiliation agreements. \n (6) Other noncurrent liabilities consist of both unfunded and under-funded postretirement benefit plans. Unfunded plans include the TEGNA Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan and the TEGNA Retiree Welfare Plan. Employer contributions, which equal the expected benefit payments, are reflected in the table above over the next ten-year period. Our under-funded plans include the TEGNA Retirement Plan and the G.B. Dealey Retirement Plan (merged into the TEGNA Retirement Plan effective Dec. 31, 2015). We expect contributions to the TEGNA Retirement Plan in 2017 of $22.3 million. TEGNA Retirement Plan contributions beyond the next fiscal year are excluded due to uncertainties regarding significant assumptions involved in estimating these contributions, such as interest rate levels as well as the amount and timing of invested asset returns. \nDue to uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2016, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement. Therefore, approximately $17 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of income taxes.\nCapital stock\nIn 2015, our Board of Directors approved an $825 million share repurchase program to be completed over a three-year period ending June 2018. As of December 31, 2016, we have $467 million remaining under this authorization. The table below summarizes our share repurchases during the past three years.\n ", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nExecutive Summary\nOur company is comprised of a dynamic portfolio of media and digital businesses that provide content that matters and brands that deliver. Our media business includes 46 television stations operating in 38 markets, offering high-quality television programming and digital content. Our digital business primarily consists of our Cars.com and CareerBuilder business units that operate in the automotive and human capital solutions industries. Cars.com is a leading online destination for automotive consumers offering credible, objective information about car shopping, selling and servicing. CareerBuilder helps companies target, attract and retain workforce talent through an array of product offerings including talent management software and other advertising and recruitment solutions.\nOn September 7, 2016, we announced our intention to spin-off the Cars.com business unit into a separate stand-alone public company and we also announced our plans to conduct a strategic review of our 53% ownership interest in CareerBuilder. While we perform the necessary steps to complete the spin and strategic review, we will maintain the current operating and reporting structure and will continue to report the financial results of both entities in continuing operations within our Digital Segment.\nFiscal year: Beginning in fiscal year 2015, we changed our financial reporting cycle to a calendar year-end. Accordingly, our 2015 fiscal year began on December 29, 2014 (the day after the end of the 2014 fiscal year) and ended on December 31, 2015. Historically, our fiscal year was a 52-53 week fiscal year that ended on the last Sunday of the calendar year. As a result, our 2015 fiscal year had two more days than fiscal year 2016. The impact of the extra days in 2015 did not have a material impact on our financial statements; and therefore, we have not restated the historical results.\nConsolidated Results from Operations\nA consolidated summary of our results is presented below.\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In millions of dollars\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Media\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1%)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Digital\n</td> <td>1,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3%\n</td> <td>1,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47%\n</td> <td>934\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3%)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>955\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and admin. expenses\n</td> <td>1,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2%\n</td> <td>1,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39%\n</td> <td>767\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1%)\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6%\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td>115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1%\n</td> <td>114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73%\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairment and facility consolidation charges (gains)\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>***\n</td> <td>(59\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>***\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>707\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-operating expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(260\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(10%)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(290\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>***\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>283\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14%)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>234\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(51\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(19%)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(63\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(7%)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(68\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48%)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>688\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from continuing operations per share - basic\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48%)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from continuing operations per share - diluted\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(47%)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.97\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Note: Numbers may not sum due to rounding.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated Operating Revenue\nOperating revenues increased $290 million, or 10%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. This increase is comprised of a $252 million increase from our Media Segment and a $39 million increase at our Digital Segment. Record Media Segment revenues of $1.93 billion were driven by political advertising revenue of $155 million, record Summer Olympics revenue of $56 million in the third quarter of 2016, and a substantial increase of retransmission revenue of $133 million and online revenue of $13 million. These increases were partially offset by a $20 million decrease in core advertising due in part to election year political displacement. Increases in the Digital Segment were driven by continued revenue growth at Cars.com of $37 million, G/O Digital of $28 million and CareerBuilder of $16 million. These increases at the Digital Segment were partially offset by the absence of $32 million of revenue contributed in 2015 by our PointRoll business, which was sold in November 2015.\nOperating revenues increased $425 million, or 16%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. This increase comprised a $435 million increase from our Digital Segment, partially offset by a $10 million decline at our Media Segment. Media Segment revenues for 2015 decreased 1% to $1.68 billion, as growth in retransmission revenue of $87 million, online revenue of $15 million, and higher core revenue of $26 million were offset by a decline of political advertising revenue of $138 million (from the record level of political advertising revenue of $159 million achieved in 2014). Digital Segment revenues totaled $1.37 billion for 2015, an increase of 47%. The increase reflects the impact of the Cars.com acquisition (acquired on October 1, 2014) as well as the strong organic growth of Cars.com revenue, as well as price increases for affiliates implemented October 1, 2014, resulting in an increase in revenue of $451 million in 2015. Partially offsetting the revenue increase at Cars.com, was a decrease of $20 million as a result of a decline in revenue and sale of our PointRoll business in November 2015.\nCosts of Revenue\nCost of revenue increased $116 million, or 13%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. This increase was primarily due to an $89 million increase in programming costs incurred by the Media Segment. In addition, our 2016 business acquisitions contributed $17 million to the increase, and cost increases at Cars.com added $11 million to our cost of revenue (primarily due to higher traffic acquisition costs and increased compensation costs).\nCost of revenue decreased $32 million, or 3%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. This decrease was due to a $25 million decrease at CareerBuilder primarily due to the expiration and non-renewal of certain revenue-share arrangements.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses increased $26 million, or 2%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase was primarily driven by the 2016 business acquisitions of Aurico, DealerRater, and Workterra, which increased selling, general, and administrative expenses by $18 million. In addition, severance expense increased $9 million year-over-year driven by a voluntary retirement program in our Media Segment completed in 2016. Our 2016 expenses also increased due to the absence of rental income at our corporate headquarters, which was $5 million in 2015, resulting from our sale of the building in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses increased $301 million, or 39%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. The majority of the increase was due to the October 2014 acquisition of the remaining ownership of Cars.com which resulted in a year over year increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $217 million.\nDepreciation Expense\nDepreciation expense decreased $1 million, or 1%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. This decrease is primarily due to a $5 million decline in depreciation at Corporate, primarily driven by the October 2015 sale of our corporate headquarters building that resulted in a year-over-year decrease in depreciation expense of $4 million. The decrease was also driven by the sale of our PointRoll business in November 2015, which led to a year-over-year decline in depreciation expense of $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by a $5 million increase in CareerBuilder's depreciation, which was due to the acquisition of new computer equipment, an increase in internally developed software and new leasehold improvements.\nDepreciation expense increased $5 million, or 6%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. The increase was due to the acquisition of Cars.com in October 2014 which resulted in a year over year increase in depreciation expense of $6 million.\nIntangible Asset Amortization Expense\nIntangible asset amortization expense increased by less than $1 million, or less than 1%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase was primarily driven by the 2016 acquisitions, which was substantially offset by a decline in amortization expense associated with previous acquisitions as a result of reaching the end of their useful lives.\nIntangible asset amortization expense increased $48 million, or 73%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. The October 2014 acquisition of Cars.com resulted in amortization expense in 2015 and 2014 of $73 million and $18 million, respectively. This increase was partially offset by a $7 million reduction in amortization expense related to certain intangible assets in 2015 as a result of reaching the end of their useful lives.\nAsset impairment and Facility Consolidation Charges (Gains)\nAsset impairment and facility consolidation charges (gains) fluctuated $91 million from a gain of ($59) million in 2015 to a charge of $32 million in 2016. The fluctuation was mainly due to the absence of the $90 million net gain from the sale of our corporate headquarters building in 2015. The 2016 charges were comprised of a goodwill impairment charge of $15 million incurred in the third quarter of 2016, a $6 million impairment related to a programming asset, a $5 million impairment charge related to a long-lived-asset, and a $5 million lease related charge.\nAsset impairment and facility consolidation charges (gains) fluctuated $104 million from charges of $45 million in 2014 to a gain of ($59) million in 2015. The year-over-year fluctuation was driven by the $90 million net gain from the sale of our corporate headquarters building in 2015, and by non-cash impairment charges of $31 million in 2014 related to certain reporting units within our Digital Segment (primarily PointRoll, ShopLocal and BLiNQ).\nOperating Income\nOperating income increased $59 million, or 6%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase was driven by the changes in revenue and operating expenses described above. Further, the increase in 2016 was partially offset by the absence of the $90 million gain on the sale of our corporate headquarters building in 2015. Our consolidated operating margins were lower at 29% in 2016 compared to 30% in 2015, primarily driven by the absence in 2016 of the net gain on the sale of our corporate headquarters building reported in 2015.\nOperating income increased $206 million, or 29%, in 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily driven by the acquisition of Cars.com which contributed $180 million of the increase. Our consolidated operating margins improved to 30% in 2015 compared to 27% in 2014 driven by improvement in margins from our Digital Segment as well as the net gain on the sale of our corporate headquarters building, partially offset by the impact from the absence of Winter Olympics and political spending in 2014.\nPayroll expense trends: Payroll expense is the largest element of our normal operating expenses, and is summarized below, expressed as a percentage of total pre-tax operating expenses. Payroll expense as a percentage of total pre-tax operating expenses decreased in 2016, reflecting that total operating expenses grew at a faster rate than payroll expense. Table 26: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payroll costs\n</td> <td>35.8%\n</td> <td>41.1%\n</td> <td>41.0%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-operating income and expense\nEquity earnings (losses): This income statement category reflects earnings or losses from our equity method investments. Equity losses increased $2 million, or 42% in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increased losses were primarily due to ($4 million) of impairment charges related to two equity method investments recorded in 2016. These impairment losses were partially offset by a year over year improvement in results for other equity method investments.\nEquity earnings (losses) fluctuated $156 million from a $151 million gain in 2014 to a ($5 million) loss in 2015. This fluctuation was primarily due to the absence of a $148 million gain on the sale of Apartments.com by Classified Ventures in 2014.\nInterest expense: Interest expense decreased $42 million, or 15%, in 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to lower average outstanding total debt balance and a lower average interest rate, reflecting the extinguishment of higher cost debt in 2015 and 2016, including the 10% senior notes and 7.125% notes that we repaid in April and November of 2016, respectively. The total average outstanding debt was $4.25 billion in 2016 compared to $4.37 billion in 2015. The weighted average interest rate on total outstanding debt was 5.29% in 2016, compared to 5.98% in 2015.\nInterest expense increased $1 million, or less than 1%, in 2015 as compared to 2014, due to a higher average debt level of $4.37 billion in 2015 compared to $3.85 billion in 2014. The higher average debt level was related to additional borrowing related to both the Belo and Cars.com acquisitions in 2013 and 2014, respectively, partly offset by a lower average interest rate. The weighted average interest rate on total outstanding debt was 5.98% in 2015, compared to 6.65% in 2014.\nA further discussion of our borrowing and related interest cost is presented in the Liquidity and capital resources\u201d section of this report beginning on page 26 and in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.\nOther non-operating items: Other non-operating items fluctuated $9 million from a loss of $12 million in 2015 to a loss of $20 million in 2016. The 2016 non-operating loss primarily consisted of $24 million in costs associated with the spin-off of our Cars.com business unit, the strategic review of CareerBuilder, and acquisition related costs. Our 2015 non-operating loss consisted of $45 million in costs related to the spin-off of our former publishing business and $9 million in costs incurred in connection with the early extinguishment of debt. These costs in 2015 were offset by a gain of $44 million on the sale of a business.\nOther non-operating items in 2014 represented a net gain of $404 million, with the majority related to the write-up of our prior 27% investment in Cars.com to fair value post-acquisition and a gain related to required accounting for the pre-existing affiliate agreement between Cars.com and us. This gain was partially offset by acquisition costs and expenses incurred for the spin-off of our publishing businesses completed in 2015.\nProvision for income taxes\nWe reported pre-tax income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA of $661 million for 2016. The effective tax rate on pre-tax income was 32.8%.\nWe reported pre-tax income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA of $560 million for 2015. The effective tax rate on pre-tax income was 36.1%.\nThe 2016 effective tax rate decreased as compared to 2015 primarily due to a decrease in TEGNA's state effective tax rate applied to our deferred tax items. This reduction of our state effective tax rate was driven by various tax planning initiatives, in particular a state income tax project that was concluded in the fourth quarter of 2016. When these tax items are reported on our future state tax returns, they will be subject to a lower tax rate than had been recorded previously, which created a deferred tax benefit in 2016 that reduced our effective tax rate. In addition, in the first quarter of 2016 we early adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) guidance on employee share-based payments that requires all excess tax benefits and tax deduction shortfalls to be recognized as an income tax benefit or expense in the income statement. As a result in 2016, we realized an excess tax benefit with respect to our employee share-based payments, which reduced our effective tax rate by 1% as compared to 2015. This FASB guidance will continue to apply in the future; however, among other factors, the amount of the income tax benefit or expense will be dependent on our future stock price, which cannot be accurately predicted.\nWe reported pre-tax income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA of $922 million for 2014. The provision for income taxes reflects a special net tax benefit from the sale of a non-strategic subsidiary at a loss, for which a partial tax benefit was recognized. The effective tax rate in 2014 was 25.4%.\nFurther information concerning income tax matters is contained in Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements.\nNet income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA Inc.\nNet income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA Inc. and related per share amounts are presented in the table below.\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In millions of dollars, except per share amounts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA Inc.\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48%)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>688\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Per basic share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48%)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Per diluted share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(47%)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.97\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA Inc. consists of net income from continuing operations reduced by net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, from CareerBuilder and its subsidiaries. We reported net income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA of $444 million or $2.02 per diluted share for 2016 compared to $357 million or $1.56 per diluted share for 2015.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $51 million in 2016, $63 million in 2015 and $68 million in 2014.\nEarnings per share benefited from a net decrease of approximately ten million diluted shares from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016, and approximately two million dilutive shares from December 31, 2014, to December 31, 2015, as a result of share repurchases, which were partially offset by share issuances under our stock-based award programs.\nOutlook for 2017: Based on current trends, we expect Media Segment revenue in the first quarter of 2017 to be flat to slightly above the first quarter of 2016. The year-over-year comparison will be unfavorably impacted by substantially lower political advertising revenue ($16 million in the first quarter of 2016) and the move of the Super Bowl to our 3 small FOX stations in 2017 from our 11 CBS stations in 2016. Excluding the unfavorable impact of the Super Bowl shift (approximately $9 million) and lower politically-related advertising, the percentage increase in Media Segment revenues is expected to be in the mid-single digits in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016.\nIn addition, beginning in January 2017, 11 of our NBC stations will be making reverse compensation payments for the first time. As such, 2017 will be a unique year as there will be an unfavorable gap between the increase in retransmission revenue we earn from multichannel video programming distributors (MVPD), compared to the increase in reverse compensation we will pay our affiliates. At the end of 2016, we renegotiated several new retransmission agreements with major MVPD carriers, and as a result, we have reduced our net retransmission gap in 2017 to approximately $25 million to $30 million. Further, we expect our strategic initiatives launched in 2016 (as discussed in our Media Segment section within Item 1 Business) will more than offset the remaining net retransmission gap in 2017.\nFor Cars.com, we are expecting modest single-digit revenue growth in the first quarter of 2017. We expect to see revenue growth in Cars.com national and major accounts businesses, but at a lower rate than during the same quarter last year primarily related to reduction in spending at two national accounts due to a transition to an advertising agency and a change in placement strategy during the first quarter. Once these transitions are completed, we expect these two\nnational accounts to increase their spending as we progress throughout the year.\nExcluding the impact of these two accounts, we expect Cars.com national and major accounts to be up in the range of 12% to 15% in the first quarter of 2017. While Cars.com is taking steps to improve, and in some cases restructure, the relationships with our affiliates, we expect a mid single-digit revenue decline in the first quarter of 2017 for affiliate revenues.\nThe following is a discussion of operating results of our Media and Digital Segments:\nMedia Segment\nAt the end of 2016, our Media operations included 46 television stations either owned or serviced through shared service agreements or other similar agreements.

The increase was driven by political advertising, a record level of Summer Olympics advertising, and a substantial increase in retransmission revenues. Core advertising revenues, which consist of local and national non-political advertising (and includes Olympics advertising), decreased $20 million or 2%, mostly due to: political advertising displacement; softer markets in the insurance and retail categories; and an $8 million impact related to two fewer days in 2016 as compared to 2015 as a result of the fiscal year-end change. These decreases were partially offset by a record $56 million Summer Olympics advertising revenue in the third quarter of 2016 which was up over 20% compared to the last Summer Olympics in 2012. Political advertising revenue increased $133 million due to the presidential election year political spending. Political revenues are cyclical and higher in even years (e.g. 2014, 2016). Retransmission revenues increased $133 million or 30% in 2016, reflecting retransmission agreements renewed at the end of last year, as well as annual rate increases for existing agreements. Digital revenues within our Media Segment increased $13 million or 12% primarily due to continued growth of digital marketing services products.\nMedia Segment operating expenses increased $159 million or 16% in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase was mainly due to an increase of $89 million in programming costs (primarily associated with reverse compensation to network affiliates related to retransmission revenue) as well as investments in growth initiatives, $19 million primarily related to severance charges incurred with the voluntary early retirement program and the absence of a $13 million building sale gain in the first quarter of 2015.\nAsset impairment charges recognized in 2016 primarily relate to a $6 million charge associated with an internally produced program and a $2 million impairment of a long-lived asset that is now classified as held for sale and was written down to its fair value in 2016.\nExcluding the impacts of the voluntary early retirement program expense and asset impairment charges in 2016 and the building sale gain in 2015, Media Segment operating expenses increased 14% in 2016.\nAs a result of all of these factors, Media Segment operating income increased to $806 million in 2016 from $714 million in 2015.\nMedia Segment results 2015-2014: Media Segment revenues decreased $10 million to $1.68 billion or 1% in 2015 as compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the absence of record level of political advertising revenue of $159 million and $41 million in Winter Olympics advertising revenue achieved during 2014. The change to a calendar year-end reporting cycle extended our fiscal 2015 by four extra days which increased Media Segment revenue by $11 million. Core advertising revenues increased $26 million or 3% in 2015. Political advertising revenue declined $138 million to $21 million in 2015. Retransmission revenues increased $87 million or 24% in 2015 resulting from newly negotiated agreements and annual rate increases. Within the Media Segment, digital revenue increased $15 million or 15% compared to 2014, reflecting continued growth from digital marketing services products.\nMedia Segment operating expenses increased $23 million or 2% in 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $22 million in programming costs as well as a $16 million increase in cost of digital initiatives, partially offset by a $13 million building sale gain in the first quarter of 2015.\nAs a result of all of these factors, Media Segment operating income decreased to $714 million in 2015 from $747 million in 2014.\nDigital Segment\nOur Digital Segment includes results for our stand-alone digital subsidiaries including Cars.com, CareerBuilder, G/O Digital and Cofactor (also operating as ShopLocal) business units. In December 2016, we sold our Cofactor business unit. In November 2015, we sold our PointRoll business unit which was previously part of Cofactor.\nMany of our other digital offerings are highly integrated within our Media Segment offerings; therefore, the results of these integrated digital offerings are reported within the operating results of our Media Segment.\nA summary of our Digital Segment results is presented below:\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In millions of dollars\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>934\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>1,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3%\n</td> <td>993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38%\n</td> <td>722\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9%\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44%\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1%\n</td> <td>92\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>***\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairment and facility consolidation charges\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5%)\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29%)\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>1,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3%\n</td> <td>1,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40%\n</td> <td>814\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNote: Numbers may not sum due to rounding.\nDigital Segment results 2016-2015: Our 2016 Digital Segment revenue was $1.41 billion, a record high. Digital Segment revenues increased $39 million, or 3%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase was driven by continued revenue growth at Cars.com of $37 million, or 6%, G/O Digital of $28 million or 94% (due to combination of a new commercial agreement which started in mid 2015 and organic growth) and CareerBuilder of $16 million, or 2%. These increases were partially offset by the sale of our former PointRoll business which contributed $32 million of revenue in 2015. The increase in Cars.com revenues was due to an increase in retail revenue (driven by increased subscription package volume and upsells and the acquisition of DealerRater) and higher national advertising purchased by auto manufacturers. The increase in CareerBuilder revenue was driven by $40 million of increases from employer services (driven by the acquisition of Aurico and higher revenue across sales channels due), $12 million of increased resume database revenues (due to sales and renewals of its new Recruitment Edge product) and $12 million from continued growth in software as a service (SaaS) revenues. These increases at CareerBuilder were partially offset by lower job site revenue of $48 million (due to lower job postings and competitive pricing pressure).\nDigital Segment expenses increased $38 million or 3% in 2016 as compared to 2015. This increase was driven by higher expenses at CareerBuilder of $47 million, primarily due to the acquisition of Aurico and Workterra. Also impacting the increase in 2016 was an increase in G/O Digital operating expenses of $24 million (due to a new commercial agreement which started in mid 2015) and an increase at Cars.com of $14 million (consistent with revenue growth). These increases are partially offset by the sale of our PointRoll business which resulted in a decline in operating expenses of $36 million, and the absence of $8 million of costs associated with our former BLiNQ business which was shut down in the second quarter of 2015.\nAs a result of these factors, Digital Segment operating income increased to $230 million in 2016.\nDigital Segment results 2015-2014: Digital Segment revenues increased $435 million, or 47%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. The increase was driven by the $451 million incremental full year impact of the Cars.com acquisition on October 1, 2014, partially offset by a decrease of revenues at CareerBuilder of $15 million, or 2%. The decrease in CareerBuilder revenues in 2015 was driven by the strategic shift in focus in its product offerings. During 2015, CareerBuilder continued its transition toward higher-margin software-as-a-service solutions, including its pre-hire platform and new recruitment software products. As a result, SaaS revenues increased $35 million, or 30%. These revenue increases were offset by declines from lower-margin, transactional source and screen arrangements and other transactional offerings totaling approximately $56 million, as CareerBuilder moved away from these product offerings to focus on the SaaS platform solutions. In addition, 2015 revenue increased $26 million due to G/O Digital (due to combination of a new commercial agreement which started in mid 2015 and organic growth), which was offset by 2015 declines in revenue of $24 million from various other digital business units (primarily PointRoll).\nDigital Segment expenses in 2015 increased $325 million, or 40%, primarily due to the $271 million incremental full year impact of the Cars.com acquisition and G/O Digital increase of $21 million (due to combination of a new commercial agreement in mid 2015 and organic growth). These increases were offset by a decrease in CareerBuilder expenses of $14 million, or 2%, (reflecting lower revenue and strategic shift in focus on its product offerings), and a $13 million reduction in expenses in the BLiNQ business, which was shut down in the second quarter of 2015.\nAs a result of these factors, Digital Segment operating income increased by $109 million or 91% in 2015.\nOperating results non-GAAP information\nPresentation of non-GAAP information: We use non-GAAP financial performance and liquidity measures to supplement the financial information presented on a GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the related GAAP measures, nor should they be considered superior to the related GAAP measures, and should be read together with financial information presented on a GAAP basis. Also, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nManagement and our Board of Directors use the non-GAAP financial measures for purposes of evaluating business unit and consolidated company performance. Furthermore, the Executive Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors uses non-GAAP measures such as Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow to evaluate management's performance. Therefore, we believe that each of the non-GAAP measures presented provides useful information to investors and other stakeholders by allowing them to view our business through the eyes of management and our Board of Directors, facilitating comparisons of results across historical periods and focus on the underlying ongoing operating performance of our business. We discuss in this Form 10-K non-GAAP financial performance measures that exclude from our reported GAAP results the impact of special items\u201d consisting of severance expense, impairment charges on operating assets and equity investments, facility consolidation charges, gains related to building sales, gains/losses related to business disposals, expenses related to business acquisitions, costs associated with the company's spin-off transactions, and benefits to our income tax provision. We also adjust net income attributed to noncontrolling interests to the extent any of the above items are related to our CareerBuilder business unit. We believe that such expenses, charges and gains are not indicative of normal, ongoing operations. Such items vary from period to period and are significantly impacted by the timing and nature of these events. Therefore, while we may incur or recognize these types of expenses, charges and gains in the future, we believe that removing these items for purposes of calculating the non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with a more focused presentation of our ongoing operating performance.\nWe discuss Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial performance measure that we believe offers a useful view of the overall operation of its businesses. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA before (1) net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, (2) interest expense, (3) income taxes, (4) equity income (losses) in unconsolidated investees, net, (5) other non-operating items such as spin-off transaction expense, investment income and currency gains and losses, (6) severance expense, (7) facility consolidation charges, (8) impairment charges, (9) depreciation and (10) amortization. When Adjusted EBITDA is discussed in reference to performance on a consolidated basis, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is Net income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA. We do not analyze non-operating items such as interest expense and income taxes on a segment level; therefore, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Adjusted EBITDA when performance is discussed on a segment level is Operating income. Users should consider the limitations of using Adjusted EBITDA, including the fact that this measure does not provide a complete measure of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to purport to be an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. In particular, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow available for management's discretionary expenditures, as this measure does not consider certain cash requirements, such as working capital needs, capital expenditures, contractual commitments, interest payments, tax payments and other debt service requirements.\nWe also discuss free cash flow, a non-GAAP liquidity measure (see Selected Financial Data on page 67). Free cash flow is defined as net cash flow from operating activities\u201d as reported on the statement of cash flows reduced by purchase of property and equipment\u201d. We believe that free cash flow is a useful measure for management and investors to evaluate the level of cash generated by operations and the ability of its operations to fund investments in new and existing businesses, return cash to shareholders under the company's capital program, repay indebtedness, add to our cash balance, or use in other discretionary activities. We use free cash flow to monitor cash available for repayment of indebtedness and in discussions with the investment community. Like Adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow is not intended to be a measure of cash flow available for management's discretionary use.\nDiscussion of special charges and credits affecting reported results: Our results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, included the following items we consider special items\u201d and are not indicative of our normal ongoing operations:\n \u2022 Severance charges primarily related to a voluntary retirement program at our Media Segment (which includes payroll and related benefit costs); \n \u2022 Non-cash asset impairment and facility consolidation charges primarily associated with goodwill, operating assets, and an operating lease; \n \u2022 Non-operating costs primarily associated with the anticipated spin-off of our Cars.com business unit, strategic review of CareerBuilder, acquisition related costs and equity method investment impairments; \n \u2022 Impact of special items on our net income attributable to noncontrolling interests; and \n \u2022 Special tax benefit related to the release of a portion of our capital loss valuation allowance due to the sale of certain deferred compensation plan investments.  Results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, included the following special items:\n \u2022 Costs associated with workforce restructuring; \n \u2022 Non-cash asset impairment and facility consolidation charges primarily related to reducing the carrying value of certain assets to fair value, a goodwill impairment charge, and shut down costs associated with our former BLiNQ business; \n \u2022 Gains on building sales, primarily from the sale of our corporate headquarters building; \n \u2022 Non-operating items related to the spin-off of our former publishing businesses, a gain related to the sale of Gannett Healthcare Group, and other miscellaneous non-operating expenses; and \n \u2022 Special tax benefit primarily related to the restructuring of our legal entities in advance of the spin-off of our publishing businesses. \nBelow are reconciliations of certain line items impacted by special items to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP on our Consolidated Statements of Income:\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In millions of dollars (except per share amounts)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Special Items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal Year Ended Dec. 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>GAAP\nmeasure\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Severance expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Asset impairment and facility consolidation charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other non-operating items and equity investment impairments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Impact of special items attributable to NCI\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Special tax benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-GAAP measure\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,369.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(25.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(32.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,311.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>972.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,030.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity loss in unconsolidated investments, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other non-operating expense (income)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-operating expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(259.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(226.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>712.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>803.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>217.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>240.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>444.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>510.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income from continuing operations per share -

Our 2015 Adjusted EBITDA was updated to conform to this new method that resulted in a reduction for the twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2015 by $1.6 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $180 million or 17% to $1.23 billion in 2016 from $1.05 billion in 2015. The increase was driven by in an increase of $121 million or 15% in the Media Segment and the absence of $52 million in publishing-related unallocated costs that occurred in 2015. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA margins increased to 36.9% in 2016 from 34.6% in 2015.\nFINANCIAL POSITION\nLiquidity and capital resources\nOur strong cash generation capability and financial condition, together with our significant borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement, are sufficient to fund our capital expenditures, interest, dividends, share repurchases, investments in strategic initiatives and other operating requirements. Over the longer term, we expect to continue to fund debt maturities, acquisitions and investments through a combination of cash flows from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit agreement and funds raised in the capital markets.\nOur strong operating cash flows enabled our Board of Directors to approve two key capital allocation initiatives following the spin-off of our publishing businesses in 2015. First, we began paying a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.14 per share. We paid dividends totaling $122 million in 2016 and $168 million in 2015 (excluding the special spin-off distribution of our publishing businesses). Second, in 2015, our Board of Directors also approved an $825 million share repurchase program to be completed over a three-year period ending June 2018. See the Capital stock\u201d section below for more information on the share repurchase program.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our total long-term debt was $4.04 billion. Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2016 totaled $77 million.\nOur operations have historically generated strong positive cash flow which, along with bank revolving credit availability, has provided adequate liquidity to meet our internal investment requirements, as well as acquisitions. Our financial and operating performance, as well as our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to maintain compliance with credit facility covenants, are subject to certain risk factors; see Item 1A - Risk Factors for further discussion.\nThe following table provides a summary of our cash flow information followed by a discussion of the key elements of our cash flows:\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In millions of dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>469\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Net income\n</td> <td>488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Non-cash adjustments\n</td> <td>291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(163\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Changes in working capital\n</td> <td>(61\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(65\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(123\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Other, net\n</td> <td>(34\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flows from operating activities\n</td> <td>683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>848\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used for) provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>(273\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,662\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used for) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>(462\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(858\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>464\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>(52\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(351\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents at end of year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNote: Numbers may not sum due to rounding.\nOperating Activities\n2016 compared to 2015: Our net cash flow from operating activities was $683 million in 2016, compared to $651 million in 2015. Operating cash flow in 2016 increased due to the absence of any pension contributions to our principal retirement plan (we made a $100 million contribution in 2015). In addition, operating cash flow increased due to higher revenue in 2016. Partially offsetting these increases in cash flow from operating activities was a $101 million increase in income tax payments (due to higher taxable income), and the absence of our former publishing businesses which generated approximately $27 million of operating cash flow in the first half of 2015 (through the spin-off date of June 29, 2015).\n2015 compared to 2014: Our net cash flow from operating activities was $651 million in 2015 compared to $848 million in 2014. The decrease was due to the relative absence of $200 million of political and Olympic revenue achieved in 2014, the absence of our publishing businesses in the third and fourth quarters of 2015, a $23 million increase in pension payments in 2015, the timing of certain reverse network compensation payments, payments related to previously accrued expenses for the shutdown of USA Weekend and routine changes in working capital. The increase in pension payments in 2015 was primarily due to a $100 million voluntary contribution we made in 2015 to our principal retirement plan prior to the spin-off of our publishing businesses. Cash paid for income taxes were lower in 2015 by $101 million compared to 2014, primarily due to the tax benefit received on the voluntary pension payment and the decrease in net income compared to the prior year.\nInvesting Activities\n2016 compared to 2015: Net cash used by investing activities was $273 million in 2016 compared to cash provided by investing activities of $217 million in 2015. The difference between periods was primarily attributable to proceeds received in 2015 of $411 million related to sales of assets (primarily the sales of our corporate headquarters and Seattle broadcast buildings) and the sale of businesses (primarily Gannett Healthcare, Clipper and PointRoll). The year over year change was also attributable to the increase in cash paid for acquisitions from $54 million in 2015 to $206 million in 2016 (which includes DealerRater, Aurico, and Workterra - see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements).\n2015 compared to 2014: Net cash provided by investing activities was $217 million for 2015 compared to cash used by investing activities of $1.66 billion in 2014. In 2015, we received proceeds of $411 million related to sales of assets and the sale of businesses. This compares to payments for acquisitions of approximately $1.99 billion (primarily Cars.com, London Broadcasting and Broadbean) in 2014. Capital expenditures amounted to $119 million in 2015 and $150 million in 2014.\nFinancing Activities\n2016 compared to 2015: Net cash used for financing activities was $462 million in 2016 compared to $858 million in 2015. The difference between periods is primarily due to 2016 decreases in: debt repayments of $170 million; repurchases of our common stock of $109 million; and a one-time cash transfer in 2015 of $63 million to our former publishing businesses in connection with the spin-off.\n2015 compared to 2014: Net cash used for financing activities was $858 million in 2015 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $464 million in 2014. The difference between periods is primarily due to receiving less proceeds from the issuance of debt, increased repurchases of our common stock in 2015, increased debt repayments in 2015, and a one-time cash transfer in 2015 of $63 million to our former publishing businesses in connection with the Gannett spin-off.\nLong-term debt\nAs of December 31, 2016, our outstanding debt, net of unamortized discounts and deferred financing costs, amounted to $4.04 billion and mainly is in the form of fixed rate notes and borrowings under a revolving credit facility. See Note 7 Long-term debt\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for a table summarizing the components of our long-term debt. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our debt and credit agreements.\nBelow is a summary of our 2016 debt activity:\n \u2022 On April 1, 2016 our unsecured notes bearing a fixed rate of 10% became due, and therefore, we made a debt maturity payment of approximately $203 million (comprised of principal and accrued interest). The payment was made using borrowings from our revolving credit facility. \n \u2022 On September 30, 2016, we borrowed $300 million under a new four-year term loan due in 2020. The interest rate on the term loan is equal to the same interest rates as borrowings under the Amended and Restated Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Agreement discussed below. Both the revolving credit agreement and the term loan are guaranteed by a majority of our wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries. We used substantially all of the proceeds from the new term loan to repay a portion of the outstanding obligation under our revolving credit facility. \n \u2022 On November 1, 2016, we redeemed the remaining $70 million of 7.125% unsecured notes due in September 2018 at par, using available cash on hand. This redemption will result in a total net reduction of interest expense of approximately $5 million over the next two years. \n \u2022 As of December 31, 2016, we had unused borrowing capacity of $844 million under our revolving credit facility. \nIn 2015, we entered into an agreement to amend and extend our existing revolving credit facility with one expiring on June 29, 2020 (the Amended and Restated Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Agreement). As a result, the maximum total leverage ratio permitted by the new agreement is 5.0x through June 30, 2017, after which, as amended, it is reduced to 4.75x through June 30, 2018, and then to 4.50x thereafter. Commitment fees on the revolving credit agreement are equal to 0.25% - 0.40% of the undrawn commitments, depending upon our leverage ratio, and are computed on the average daily undrawn balance under the revolving credit agreement and paid each quarter. Under the Amended and Restated Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Agreement, we may borrow at an applicable margin above the Eurodollar base rate (LIBOR loan) or the higher of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50%, or the one month LIBOR rate plus 1.00% (ABR loan). The applicable margin is determined based on our leverage ratio but differs between LIBOR loans and ABR loans. For LIBOR-based borrowing, the margin varies from 1.75% to 2.50%. For ABR-based borrowing, the margin will vary from 0.75% to 1.50%. On September 26, 2016, we amended the Amended and Restated Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Agreement to increase the capacity of the facility by $103 million. Total commitments under the Amended and Restated Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Agreement are $1.5 billion.\nWe also have an effective shelf registration statement under which an unspecified amount of securities may be issued, subject to a $7.0 billion limit established by the Board of Directors. Proceeds from the sale of such securities may be used for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures, working capital, securities repurchase programs, repayment of debt and financing of acquisitions. We may also invest borrowed funds that are not required for other purposes in short-term marketable securities.\nOur debt maturities may be repaid with cash flow from operating activities, by accessing capital markets or a combination of both. The following schedule of annual maturities of the principal amount of total debt assumes we use available capacity under our revolving credit agreement to refinance unsecured floating rate term loans and fixed rate notes due in 2017 through 2018. Based on this refinancing assumption, all of the obligations other than the VIE unsecured floating rate term loan due prior to 2019 are reflected as maturities for 2019 and beyond.\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In thousands of dollars\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017 (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>646\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 (1)\n</td> <td>646\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>700,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 (2)\n</td> <td>1,612,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021\n</td> <td>350,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>1,415,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,078,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Amortization of term debt due in 2017 and 2018 is assumed to be repaid with funds from the revolving credit agreement, which matures in 2020.

See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. \n (2) We have $635 million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of Dec. 31, 2016. We have not included estimated interest payments since payments into and out of the credit facility change daily. Interest on the senior notes is based on the stated cash coupon rate and excludes the amortization of debt issuance discount. The term loan interest rates are based on the actual rates as of Dec. 31, 2016. \n (3) See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. \n (4) Includes purchase obligations related to capital projects, interactive marketing agreements and other legally binding commitments. Amounts which we are liable for under purchase orders outstanding at Dec. 31, 2016, are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as accounts payable and accrued liabilities and are excluded from the table above. \n (5) Programming contracts include television station commitments to purchase programming to be produced in future years. This also includes amounts related to our network affiliation agreements. \n (6) Other noncurrent liabilities consist of both unfunded and under-funded postretirement benefit plans. Unfunded plans include the TEGNA Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan and the TEGNA Retiree Welfare Plan. Employer contributions, which equal the expected benefit payments, are reflected in the table above over the next ten-year period. Our under-funded plans include the TEGNA Retirement Plan and the G.B. Dealey Retirement Plan (merged into the TEGNA Retirement Plan effective Dec. 31, 2015). We expect contributions to the TEGNA Retirement Plan in 2017 of $22.3 million. TEGNA Retirement Plan contributions beyond the next fiscal year are excluded due to uncertainties regarding significant assumptions involved in estimating these contributions, such as interest rate levels as well as the amount and timing of invested asset returns. \nDue to uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2016, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement. Therefore, approximately $17 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of income taxes.\nCapital stock\nIn 2015, our Board of Directors approved an $825 million share repurchase program to be completed over a three-year period ending June 2018. As of December 31, 2016, we have $467 million remaining under this authorization. The table below summarizes our share repurchases during the past three years.\n "}
