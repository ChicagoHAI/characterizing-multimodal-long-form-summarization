Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our operations, cash flows, liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements contained in this report.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a global apparel company that designs, sources, markets and distributes products bearing the trademarks of our Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide lifestyle brands, other owned brands and licensed brands as well as private label apparel products. During Fiscal 2016, 92% of our net sales were from products bearing brands that we own and 66% of our net sales were through our direct to consumer channels of distribution. In Fiscal 2015, 96% of our consolidated net sales were to customers located in the United States, with the sales outside the United States consisting primarily of our Tommy Bahama products in Canada and the Asia-Pacific region.\nOur business strategy is to develop and market compelling lifestyle brands and products that evoke a strong emotional response from our target consumers. We consider lifestyle brands to be those brands that have a clearly defined and targeted point of view inspired by an appealing lifestyle or attitude. Furthermore, we believe lifestyle brands like Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide that create an emotional connection with consumers can command greater loyalty and higher price points at retail and create licensing opportunities, which may drive higher earnings. We believe the attraction of a lifestyle brand depends on creating compelling product, effectively communicating the respective lifestyle brand message and distributing products to consumers where and when they want it.\nOur ability to compete successfully in styling and marketing is directly related to our proficiency in foreseeing changes and trends in fashion and consumer preference, and presenting appealing products for consumers. Our design-led, commercially informed lifestyle brand operations strive to provide exciting, differentiated products each season.\nTo further strengthen each lifestyle brand's connections with consumers, we directly communicate with consumers through electronic and print media on a regular basis. We believe our ability to effectively communicate the images, lifestyle and products of our brands and create an emotional connection with consumers is critical to the success of the brands. Our advertising for our brands often attempts to convey the lifestyle of the brand as well as a specific product.\nWe distribute our owned lifestyle branded products primarily through our direct to consumer channels, consisting of our Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer retail stores and our e-commerce sites for Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide, and through our wholesale distribution channels. Our direct to consumer operations provide us with the opportunity to interact directly with our customers, present to them a broad assortment of our current season products and immerse them in the theme of the lifestyle brand. We believe that presenting our products in a setting specifically designed to showcase the lifestyle on which the brands are based enhances the image of our brands. Our Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer full-price retail stores provide high visibility for our brands and products, and allow us to stay close to the preferences of our consumers, while also providing a platform for long-term growth for the brands. In Tommy Bahama, we also operate a limited number of restaurants, generally adjacent to a Tommy Bahama full-price retail store location, which we believe further enhance the brand's image with consumers.\nAdditionally, our e-commerce websites, which represented 18% of our consolidated net sales in Fiscal 2016, provide the opportunity to increase revenues by reaching a larger population of consumers and at the same time allow our brands to provide a broader range of products. Our e-commerce flash clearance sales on our websites and our Tommy Bahama outlet stores play an important role in overall brand and inventory management by allowing us to sell discontinued and out-of-season products in brand appropriate settings and often at better prices than are typically available from third party off-price retailers.\nThe wholesale operations of our lifestyle brands complement our direct to consumer operations and provide access to a larger group of consumers. As we seek to maintain the integrity of our lifestyle brands by limiting promotional activity in our full-price retail stores and e-commerce websites, we generally target wholesale customers that follow this same approach in their stores. Our wholesale customers for our Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide brands include better department stores and specialty stores, including Signature Stores for Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide.\nWithin our Lanier Apparel operating group, we sell tailored clothing and sportswear products under licensed brands, private labels and owned brands. Lanier Apparel's customers include department stores, discount and off-price retailers, warehouse clubs, national chains, specialty retailers and others throughout the United States.\nAll of our operating groups operate in highly competitive apparel markets in which numerous U.S.-based and foreign apparel firms compete. No single apparel firm or small group of apparel firms dominates the apparel industry, and our direct competitors vary by operating group and distribution channel. We believe the principal competitive factors in the apparel industry are reputation, value, and image of brand names; design; consumer preference; price; quality; marketing; product fulfillment capabilities; and customer service.\nThe apparel industry is cyclical and very dependent upon the overall level and focus of discretionary consumer spending, which changes as regional, domestic and international economic conditions change. Often, negative economic conditions have a longer and more severe impact on the apparel industry than on other industries. We believe current global\neconomic conditions and the resulting economic uncertainty continue to impact our business, and the apparel industry as a whole.\nWe believe the retail apparel market is evolving very rapidly and in ways that are having a disruptive impact on traditional fashion retailing. The application of technology, including the internet and mobile devices, to fashion retail provides consumers increasing access to multiple, responsive distribution platforms and an unprecedented ability to communicate directly with brands, retailers and others. As a result, consumers have more information and broader, faster and cheaper access to goods than they have ever had before. This, along with the coming of age of the millennial\u201d generation, is revolutionizing the way that consumers shop for fashion and other goods. The evidence is increasingly apparent with marked weakness in department stores and mall-based retailers, decreased consumer retail traffic, a more promotional retail environment, expansion of off-price and discount retailers, and growing internet purchases.\nWhile this evolution in the fashion retail industry presents significant risks, especially for traditional retailers who fail or are unable to adapt, we believe it also presents a tremendous opportunity for brands and retailers. We believe our brands have attributes that are true competitive advantages in this new retailing paradigm and we are leveraging technology to serve our consumers when and where they want to be served. We continue to believe that our lifestyle brands are well suited to succeed and thrive in the long term while managing the various challenges facing our industry.\nSpecifically, we believe our lifestyle brands have opportunities for long-term growth in their direct to consumer businesses. We anticipate increased sales in our e-commerce operations, which are expected to grow at a faster rate than bricks and mortar comparable full-price retail store sales. This growth can also be achieved through prudent expansion of bricks and mortar full-price retail store operations and modest comparable full-price retail store sales increases. Despite the changes in the retail environment, we expect there will continue to be desirable locations to increase our store count.\nOur lifestyle brands also have an opportunity for modest sales increases in their wholesale businesses in the long term primarily from current customers adding to their existing door count and increasing their on-line business, increased sales to on-line retailers and the selective addition of new wholesale customers who generally follow a retail model with limited discounting; however, we must be diligent in our effort to avoid compromising the integrity of the brand by maintaining or growing sales with wholesale customers that may not be aligned with our long-term strategy. This is particularly important with the challenges in the department store channel, which represents about one-half of our consolidated wholesale sales, or 16% of our consolidated net sales. We also believe that there are opportunities for modest sales growth for Lanier Apparel in the future through new product programs for existing and new customers.\nWe believe we must continue to invest in our lifestyle brands to take advantage of their long-term growth opportunities. Investments include capital expenditures primarily related to the direct to consumer operations such as technology enhancements, e-commerce initiatives, full-price retail store and restaurant build-out for new and relocated locations as well as remodels, and distribution center and administrative office expansion initiatives. Additionally, while we anticipate increased employment, advertising and other costs in key functions to support the ongoing business operations and fuel future sales growth, we remain focused on appropriately managing our operating expenses.\nIn the midst of the challenges in our industry, an important focus for us in Fiscal 2017 is advancing various initiatives to increase the profitability of the Tommy Bahama business. These initiatives generally focus on increasing gross margin and operating margin through efforts such as: product cost reductions; selective price increases; reducing inventory purchases; more rapidly clearing excess inventory; redefining our approach to inventory clearance; effectively managing controllable and discretionary operating expenses; taking a more conservative approach to full-price retail store and outlet openings and renewals; and continuing our efforts to reduce Asia-Pacific operating losses.\nWe continue to believe it is important to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity. We believe positive cash flow from operations in the future coupled with the strength of our balance sheet and liquidity will provide us with sufficient resources to fund future investments in our owned lifestyle brands. While we believe we have significant opportunities to appropriately deploy our capital and resources in our existing lifestyle brands, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to add additional lifestyle brands to our portfolio if we identify appropriate targets which meet our investment criteria.\nImportant factors relating to certain risks, many of which are beyond our ability to control or predict, which could impact our business are described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report.\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated operating results from continuing operations (in thousands, except per share amounts) for Fiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015: Table 38: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,022,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>969,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earnings from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earnings from continuing operations per diluted share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe primary reasons for the lower earnings from continuing operations per diluted share in Fiscal 2016 were the lower operating income in Tommy Bahama and increased interest expense partially offset by higher income in Lilly Pulitzer, improved operating results in Corporate and Other and a lower effective tax rate.\nSouthern Tide Acquisition\nOn April 19, 2016, we acquired Southern Tide, LLC, which owns the Southern Tide lifestyle apparel brand. Southern Tide carries an extensive selection of men's shirts, pants, shorts, outerwear, ties, swimwear, footwear and accessories, as well as a women's collection. The brand's products are sold through its wholesale operations to specialty stores, department stores and Southern Tide Signature Stores as well as through its direct to consumer operations on the Southern Tide website. The purchase price for the acquisition was $85 million in cash, subject to adjustment based on net working capital as of the closing date for the acquisition. We used borrowings under our revolving credit facility to finance the transaction. For additional information about the Southern Tide acquisition, refer to Part I, Item 1. Business and Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, both included in this report.\nOPERATING GROUPS\nOur business is primarily operated through our Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer, Lanier Apparel and Southern Tide operating groups. We identify our operating groups based on the way our management organizes the components of our business for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. Our operating group structure reflects a brand-focused management approach, emphasizing operational coordination and resource allocation across each brand's direct to consumer, wholesale and licensing operations, as applicable.\nTommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide each design, source, market and distribute apparel and related products bearing their respective trademarks and also license their trademarks for other product categories, while Lanier Apparel designs, sources and distributes branded and private label men's tailored clothing, sportswear and other products. Corporate and Other is a reconciling category for reporting purposes and includes our corporate offices, substantially all financing activities, elimination of inter-segment sales, LIFO inventory accounting adjustments, other costs that are not allocated to the operating groups and operations of our other businesses which are not included in our operating groups, including our Lyons, Georgia distribution center operations. Our LIFO inventory pool does not correspond to our operating group definitions; therefore, LIFO inventory accounting adjustments are not allocated to our operating groups.\nFor additional information about each of our operating groups, see Part I, Item 1. Business and Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, both included in this report.\nCOMPARABLE STORE SALES\nWe often disclose comparable store sales in order to provide additional information regarding changes in our results of operations between periods. Our disclosures of comparable store sales include net sales from full-price retail stores and our e-commerce sites, excluding sales associated with e-commerce flash clearance sales. We believe that the inclusion of both our full-price retail stores and e-commerce sites in the comparable store sales disclosures is a more meaningful way of reporting our comparable store sales results, given similar inventory planning, allocation and return policies, as well as our cross-channel marketing and other initiatives for the direct to consumer channel. For our comparable store sales disclosures, we exclude (1) outlet store sales, warehouse sales and e-commerce flash clearance sales, as those clearance sales are used primarily to liquidate end of season inventory, which may vary significantly depending on the level of end of season inventory on hand and generally occur at lower gross margins than our non-clearance direct to consumer sales, and (2) restaurant sales, as we do not currently believe that the inclusion of restaurant sales is meaningful in assessing our consolidated results of operations. Comparable store sales information reflects net sales, including shipping and handling revenues, if any, associated with product sales.\nFor purposes of our disclosures, we consider a comparable store to be, in addition to our e-commerce sites, a physical full-price retail store that was owned and open as of the beginning of the prior fiscal year and which did not have during the relevant periods, and is not within the current fiscal year scheduled to have, (1) a remodel resulting in the store being closed for an extended period of time (which we define as a period of two weeks or longer), (2) a greater than 15% change in the size of the retail space due to expansion, reduction or relocation to a new retail space, (3) a relocation to a new space that was significantly different from the prior retail space, or (4) a closing or opening of a Tommy Bahama restaurant adjacent to the full-price retail store. For those stores which are excluded from comparable stores based on the preceding sentence, the stores continue to be excluded from comparable store sales until the criteria for a new store is met subsequent to the remodel, relocation or restaurant closing or opening. A store that is remodeled generally will continue to be included in our comparable store sales metrics as a store is not typically closed for a two week period during a remodel; however, in some cases a store may be closed for more than two weeks during a remodel. A store that is relocated generally will not be included in our comparable store sales metrics until that store has been open in the relocated space for the entirety of the prior fiscal year as the size or other characteristics of the store typically change significantly from the prior location. Additionally, any stores that were closed during the prior fiscal year or current fiscal year, or which we plan to close or vacate in the current fiscal year, are excluded from the definition of comparable store sales.\nDefinitions and calculations of comparable store sales differ among retail companies, and therefore comparable store sales metrics disclosed by us may not be comparable to the metrics disclosed by other companies.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth the specified line items in our consolidated statements of operations both in dollars (in thousands) and as a percentage of net sales. We have calculated all percentages based on actual data, but percentage columns may not add due to rounding.

Each dollar and percentage change provided reflects the change between these periods unless indicated otherwise. Each dollar and share amount included in the tables is in thousands except for per share amounts. Individual line\nitems of our consolidated statements of operations may not be directly comparable to those of our competitors, as classification of certain expenses may vary by company.\nNet Sales\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2015\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tommy Bahama\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>658,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>658,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lilly Pulitzer\n</td> <td>233,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>204,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lanier Apparel\n</td> <td>100,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,353\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(4.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Southern Tide\n</td> <td>27,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and Other\n</td> <td>2,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,022,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>969,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated net sales increased $53.3 million, or 5.5%, in Fiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015. The increase in consolidated net sales was primarily driven by (1) the $27.4 million of net sales of Southern Tide, which was acquired on April 19, 2016, (2) an incremental net sales increase of $20.2 million associated with the operation of additional full-price retail stores in Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer, (3) a $7.0 million net increase in direct to consumer clearance sales reflecting an increase in e-commerce flash clearance sales at Lilly Pulitzer and decreases in outlet store sales at Tommy Bahama and (4) a $5.4 million increase in restaurant sales in Tommy Bahama. These sales increases were partially offset by a $6.5 million, or 2%, decrease in comparable store sales to $404.1 million in Fiscal 2016 from $410.6 million in Fiscal 2015 reflecting a decrease in comparable store sales at Tommy Bahama of 3% and an increase in comparable store sales at Lilly Pulitzer of 2%. We believe that certain macroeconomic factors, including lower retail store traffic, the evolving impact of digital technology on consumer shopping habits and the 2016 election cycle, impacted the sales in each of our direct to consumer and wholesale businesses in Fiscal 2016. The changes in net sales by operating group are discussed below.\nThe following table presents the proportion of our consolidated net sales by distribution channel for each period presented:\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full-price retail stores and outlets\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>E-commerce\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restaurant\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTommy Bahama:\nThe Tommy Bahama net sales increase of $0.4 million, or 0.1%, was primarily driven by (1) an incremental net sales increase of $12.4 million associated with the operation of additional full-price retail stores and (2) a $5.4 million increase in restaurant sales primarily resulting from the impact of a full year of operations of the Waikiki restaurant in Fiscal 2016 and a modest increase at restaurants open for the full year of Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015. These sales increases were offset by (1) a $8.8 million, or 3%, decrease in comparable store sales to $302.5 million in Fiscal 2016 from $311.3 million in Fiscal 2015, (2) a $3.6 million decrease in net sales through our off-price direct to consumer clearance channels, primarily reflecting a decrease in sales in existing outlet stores, and (3) a $5.2 million decrease in wholesale sales. The decreases in the direct to consumer channels were primarily due to lower traffic in both our full-price retail stores and outlet stores. The decrease in wholesale sales reflects lower full-price wholesale sales reflecting the challenging environment of our wholesale department store and specialty store accounts.\nAs of January 28, 2017, we operated 168 Tommy Bahama stores globally, consisting of 111 full-price retail stores, 17 retail-restaurant locations and 40 outlet stores. As of January 30, 2016, we operated 164 Tommy Bahama stores consisting of 107 full-price retail stores, 16 retail-restaurant locations and 41 outlet stores. The following table presents the proportion of net sales by distribution channel for Tommy Bahama for each period presented:\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full-price retail stores and outlets\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>E-commerce\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restaurant\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLilly Pulitzer:\nThe Lilly Pulitzer net sales increase of $28.7 million, or 14.0%, was primarily a result of (1) an incremental net sales increase of $11.2 million associated with the operation of additional full-price retail stores, (2) a $10.7 million increase in e-commerce flash clearance sales, (3) an $8.2 million increase in wholesale sales primarily resulting from increased orders from existing wholesale customers and (4) a $2.2 million, or 2%, increase in comparable store sales to $101.5 million in Fiscal 2016 compared to $99.3 million in Fiscal 2015. These sales increases were partially offset by a net $3.8 million decrease in warehouse sales as Lilly Pulitzer did not anniversary its June warehouse sale in 2016. As of January 28, 2017, we operated 40 Lilly Pulitzer full-price retail stores, after opening six new stores, acquiring one former Signature Store and closing one store during Fiscal 2016, compared to 34 full-price retail stores as of January 30, 2016. The following table presents the proportion of net sales by distribution channel for Lilly Pulitzer for each period presented:\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full-price retail stores and warehouse sales\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>E-commerce\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLanier Apparel:\nThe decrease in net sales for Lanier Apparel of $4.4 million, or 4.1%, was primarily due to lower sales of $6.5 million in the tailored clothing business partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in the sportswear business. The decreased sales in the tailored clothing business was primarily due to lower sales in certain programs including reductions in volume, shifts of timing and exits from various programs. These reductions in volume were partially offset by initial shipments and volume increases in other programs. The increased sales in the sportswear business were primarily due to increased volumes in private label sportswear programs.\nSouthern Tide:\nThe net sales of Southern Tide reflect the sales of Southern Tide for the period from the date of acquisition on April 19, 2016 through January 28, 2017. During the period from April 19, 2016 through January 28, 2017, 77% of Southern Tide's net sales were wholesale sales with the remainder of the sales consisting of e-commerce sales. We estimate that net sales in Fiscal 2017 will be in excess of $40 million, with about 75% to 80% of the sales consisting of wholesale sales and the remainder consisting of e-commerce sales on the Southern Tide website.\nCorporate and Other:\nCorporate and Other net sales primarily consist of the net sales of our Lyons, Georgia distribution center to third party warehouse customers as well as the impact of the elimination of intercompany sales between our operating groups. Net sales in Fiscal 2015 included the unfavorable impact of the elimination of intercompany sales between our operating groups with no meaningful impact of intercompany sales between our operating groups in Fiscal 2016.\nGross Profit\nThe table below presents gross profit by operating group and in total for Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015 as well as the change between those two periods. Our gross profit and gross margin, which is calculated as gross profit divided by net sales, may not be directly comparable to those of our competitors, as the statement of operations classification of certain expenses may vary by company.\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2015\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tommy Bahama\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>386,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>393,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,571\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lilly Pulitzer\n</td> <td>148,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lanier Apparel\n</td> <td>29,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(970\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(3.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Southern Tide\n</td> <td>10,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and Other\n</td> <td>7,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total gross profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>582,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>558,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LIFO (credit) charge included in Corporate and Other\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,884\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventory step-up charge included in Southern Tide\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in consolidated gross profit was primarily due to higher net sales, as discussed above, and the net favorable impact of LIFO accounting.

The inventory markdowns primarily resulted from a change in Tommy Bahama's approach to inventory clearance; starting in January 2017, Tommy Bahama intends to aggressively clear prior season inventory by taking initial markdowns on certain product categories in its full-price retail stores and then clearing any remaining inventory through both its outlet stores and third party off-price retailers and by operating the outlet stores with lower inventory levels and with better merchandised assortments.\nThe lower gross margins in the direct to consumer channel primarily reflects lower gross margins in outlet store and e-commerce flash clearance sales which were primarily due to our efforts to drive traffic in our outlet stores, reduce inventory levels and dispose of prior season inventory during Fiscal 2016. The higher discounting in our off-price direct to consumer channel was focused on women's, home and other products as well as footwear, which we have transitioned to a third party licensee. Full-price retail store and e-commerce gross margins were also lower primarily due to a greater proportion of sales in Fiscal 2016 occurring in connection with our loyalty award card, Flip-Side and Friends & Family marketing events, which typically have lower gross margins than sales during non-promotional periods, and the impact of Tommy Bahama discounting certain end-of-season women, home and other product in store and on-line beginning in January 2017. The decrease in gross margin in the wholesale distribution channel was primarily due to a change in sales mix with off-price sales representing a greater proportion of Tommy Bahama's wholesale sales in Fiscal 2016.\nLilly Pulitzer:\nThe decrease in gross margin for Lilly Pulitzer in Fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by the change in sales mix as e-commerce flash clearance sales represented a greater proportion of sales during Fiscal 2016 and in-store markdowns were more significant in Fiscal 2016.\nLanier Apparel:\nThe increase in gross margin for Lanier Apparel was primarily due to the net favorable impact of in-stock program allowances and inventory markdowns in Fiscal 2016 as compared to Fiscal 2015.\nSouthern Tide:\nThe gross profit of Southern Tide for Fiscal 2016 includes the gross profit of Southern Tide for the period from the date of acquisition on April 19, 2016 through January 28, 2017, which was impacted by $2.7 million of incremental cost of goods sold associated with the step-up of inventory recognized at acquisition. Therefore, we do not consider the gross profit or gross margin for this period to be indicative of expected gross profit, or gross margin, for future periods. All amounts related to the step-up of inventory were recognized during Fiscal 2016, thus gross margin for Southern Tide is expected to be higher in future periods.\nCorporate and Other:\nThe gross profit in Corporate and Other in each period primarily reflects (1) the gross profit of our Lyons, Georgia distribution center operations, (2) the impact of LIFO accounting adjustments and (3) the impact of certain consolidating adjustments, including the elimination of intercompany sales between our operating groups. The primary driver for the higher gross profit was that Fiscal 2016 was favorably impacted by a LIFO accounting credit of $5.9 million with no significant impact from LIFO accounting in Fiscal 2015. The LIFO accounting credit in Fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the LIFO accounting reversal of the significant inventory markdowns recognized in Tommy Bahama during Fiscal 2016.\nSG&A\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2015\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>507,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>475,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A (as a % of net sales)\n</td> <td>49.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>49.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets included in Tommy Bahama associated with Tommy Bahama Canada acquisition\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets included in Southern Tide\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction expenses associated with the Southern Tide acquisition included in Corporate and Other\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>762\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution center integration charges\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>454\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in SG&A was primarily due to (1) $16.9 million of incremental costs in Fiscal 2016 associated with additional Tommy Bahama full-price retail stores and restaurants and Lilly Pulitzer full-price retail stores, (2) $11.4 million of SG&A associated with Southern Tide, including amortization of intangible assets and distribution center integration costs, (3) an increase in brand advertising, marketing and other expenses in Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer to increase brand awareness and provide support for the brands, (4) increased depreciation expense of $2.2 million related to e-commerce operations and inventory/order management systems in Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer that were implemented in the First Quarter of Fiscal 2016, (5) asset impairment charges of $1.9 million primarily related to three outlet store closings and certain information technology assets, (6) an increase in severance expenses of $1.5 million and (6) $0.8 million of transaction expenses associated with the Southern Tide acquisition, which are included in Corporate and Other. These SG&A increases were partially offset by $8.0 million of lower incentive compensation, with decreases in each operating group as well as Corporate and Other.\nSG&A included amortization of intangible assets of $2.2 million in Fiscal 2016 and $2.0 million in Fiscal 2015 with the increase primarily due to amortization related to the Southern Tide intangible assets. We anticipate that amortization of intangible assets for Fiscal 2017 will be approximately $2.2 million.\nRoyalties and other operating income\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2015\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Royalties and other operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(260\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRoyalties and other operating income in Fiscal 2016 primarily reflects income received from third parties from the licensing of our Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide brands.

The lower effective tax rate in Fiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015 was primarily due to (1) improved operating results in our Hong Kong-based sourcing operations and Tommy Bahama Asia-Pacific retail operations resulting in the utilization of certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards, (2) the reversal of valuation allowances in certain foreign jurisdictions based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances related to our ability to realize those net operating loss carryforwards in future periods, (3) lower domestic earnings and (4) certain favorable discrete items, including the tax benefit associated with the vesting of certain restricted stock awards. Our effective tax rate for Fiscal 2017 is expected to be approximately 39%, reflecting an expected unfavorable impact on tax expense of stock awards with a grant date fair value of $78 per share that vest in April 2017 and the absence of operating loss carryforwards we may utilize in Fiscal 2017.\nNet earnings from continuing operations\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earnings from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earnings from continuing operations per diluted share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average shares outstanding - diluted\n</td> <td>16,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe primary reasons for the lower earnings from continuing operations per diluted share in Fiscal 2016 were the lower operating income in Tommy Bahama and increased interest expense partially offset by higher income in Lilly Pulitzer, improved operating results in Corporate and Other and a lower effective tax rate.\nDiscontinued operations\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2015\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,038\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27,975\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes in Fiscal 2016 primarily reflects an additional loss related to the retained lease obligations of our discontinued operations primarily as a result of the default and failure to pay by a sub-tenant and an updated assessment of the anticipated losses considering anticipated sub-lease income to be earned, timing of obtaining a tenant, lease incentives and market rents. Fiscal 2015 reflects the loss on the sale of our former Ben Sherman business, which was sold in the Second Quarter of Fiscal 2015, as well as the operations of the discontinued operations prior to disposal and any charges related to the discontinued operations subsequent to disposal. We do not anticipate significant operations or earnings related to the discontinued operations in future periods, with cash flow attributable to discontinued operations in the future primarily related to the amounts associated with certain retained lease obligations, which are estimated at $5.4 million as of January 28, 2017. The estimated lease liability represents our best estimate of the future net loss anticipated with respect to the\nretained lease obligations; however, the ultimate loss remains uncertain as the amount of any sub-lease income is dependent upon negotiated terms of any sub-lease agreements entered into for the space and the ability of those sub-tenants to pay the sub-lease income or alternatively, dependent upon lease termination costs negotiated with the landlords in the future.\nFISCAL 2015 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2014\nThe discussion and tables below compare certain line items included in our statements of operations for Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014.

The lower direct to consumer gross margin was primarily due to a greater proportion of sales in our full-price retail stores and e-commerce website occurring in connection with Tommy Bahama's loyalty award card, Flip-Side and Friends & Family events and more significant in-store discounts in our outlet stores. The lower gross margin in the wholesale business was primarily a result of more significant discounts and allowances, particularly for wholesale off-price sales.\nLilly Pulitzer:\nThe increase in gross margin for Lilly Pulitzer was primarily driven by a change in sales mix towards the direct to consumer channel of distribution and an increase in gross margins of the direct to consumer businesses.\nLanier Apparel:\nThe increase in gross margin for Lanier Apparel was primarily due to a change in sales mix with a greater proportion of sales consisting of higher gross margin branded business programs, in both the tailored clothing and sportswear businesses, which was partially offset by the impact of more significant inventory markdowns in Fiscal 2015.\nCorporate and Other:\nThe gross profit in Corporate and Other in each period primarily reflects (1) the gross profit of our Lyons, Georgia distribution center operations, (2) the impact of LIFO accounting adjustments and (3) the impact of certain consolidating adjustments, including the elimination of intercompany sales between our operating groups.

The higher SG&A reflects (1) $15.1 million of incremental SG&A associated with the cost of operating additional full-price retail stores and restaurants, including pre-opening rent and set-up costs associated with new stores and restaurants, (2) $2.7 million of increased occupancy costs associated with duplicate rent expense, moving costs and higher rent structure related to the relocation of Tommy Bahama's office in Seattle, Washington during the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2015 and (3) higher costs to support the growing Tommy Bahama business. These higher SG&A amounts were partially offset by reductions in other SG&A accounts, including incentive compensation. The operating loss for the Tommy Bahama Waikiki retail-restaurant location prior to opening in late October 2015 was $2.1 million, with the substantial majority of this loss consisting of pre-opening rent and set-up costs, which are included in the incremental SG&A amount associated with new locations above.

Our primary uses of cash flow include the purchase of products in the operation of our business from third party contract manufacturers outside of the United States, as well as operating expenses including employee compensation and benefits, occupancy-related costs, marketing and advertising costs, other general and administrative expenses and the payment of periodic interest payments related to our financing arrangements. Additionally, we use cash for the funding of capital expenditures, dividends and repayment of indebtedness. In the ordinary course of business, we maintain certain levels of inventory and extend credit to our wholesale customers. Thus, we require a certain amount of working capital to operate our business. If cash inflows are less than cash outflows, we have access to amounts under our U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement, subject to its terms, which is described below. We may seek to finance our future cash requirements through various methods, including cash flow from operations, borrowings under our current or additional credit facilities, sales of debt or equity securities and cash on hand.\nAs of January 28, 2017, we had $6.3 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, with $91.5 million of borrowings outstanding and $185.5 million of availability under our U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement. We believe our balance sheet and anticipated future positive cash flow from operating activities provide sufficient cash flow to satisfy our ongoing cash requirements as well as ample opportunity to continue to invest in our brands and our direct to consumer initiatives.\nKey Liquidity Measures\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>January 28, 2017\n</td> <td>January 30, 2016\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Current Assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>231,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>216,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Current Liabilities\n</td> <td>131,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working capital\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working capital ratio\n</td> <td>1.76\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.68\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt to total capital ratio\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur working capital ratio is calculated by dividing total current assets by total current liabilities. Current assets increased from January 30, 2016 to January 28, 2017 primarily due to the $22.9 million of current assets related to the Southern Tide business, partially offset by lower current assets in our other operating groups. Current liabilities as of January 28, 2017 was comparable to current liabilities as of January 30, 2016 reflecting increases in accounts payable, other accrued expenses and liabilities and liabilities related to discontinued operations partially offset by a decrease in accrued compensation. Changes in current assets and current liabilities are discussed below.\nFor the ratio of debt to total capital, debt is defined as short-term and long-term debt included in continuing operations, and total capital is defined as debt plus shareholders' equity. Debt was $91.5 million at January 28, 2017 and $44.0 million at January 30, 2016, while shareholders' equity was $376.1 million at January 28, 2017 and $334.4 million at January 30, 2016. The increase in debt since January 30, 2016 was primarily due to the payment of $95.0 million related to acquisitions, $49.4 million of capital expenditures and the payment of $18.1 million of dividends which were partially offset by $118.6 million of cash flow from operations. Shareholders' equity increased from January 30, 2016, primarily as a result of net earnings less dividends paid. Our debt levels and ratio of debt to total capital in future periods may not be comparable to historical amounts as we continue to assess, and possibly make changes to, our capital structure. Changes in our capital structure in the future, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nBalance Sheet\nThe following tables set forth certain information included in our consolidated balance sheets (in thousands). As a result of our acquisition of Southern Tide during the First Quarter of Fiscal 2016, a number of line items in our balance sheet increased as discussed below. Below each table are explanations for any significant changes in the balances from January 30, 2016 to January 28, 2017.\nCurrent Assets:\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>January 28, 2017\n</td> <td>January 30, 2016\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Receivables, net\n</td> <td>58,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(786\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventories, net\n</td> <td>142,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prepaid expenses\n</td> <td>24,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Current Assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>231,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>216,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash and cash equivalents as of January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016 include typical cash amounts maintained on an ongoing basis in our operations, which generally ranges from $5 million to $10 million at any given time. Any excess cash is generally used to repay amounts outstanding under our U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement. The decrease in receivables, net as of January 28, 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in receivables in our Lanier Apparel business reflecting the lower sales in that business during the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2016, which was partially offset by the receivables related to the Southern Tide business.\nInventories, net as of January 28, 2017 increased from January 30, 2016 as a result of inventories related to the Southern Tide business. Inventories in our other businesses decreased year over year as lower inventories in Tommy Bahama were partially offset by higher inventories in Lilly Pulitzer and Corporate and Other. The lower inventories in Tommy Bahama reflect Tommy Bahama's focus on managing inventory buys on a total operating group basis, sale of a greater amount of inventory units through outlet stores and off-price wholesale channels during Fiscal 2016 and certain inventory markdowns.The increase in inventory in Corporate and Other was primarily due to the impact of LIFO accounting including\nthe reversal of inventory markdowns. Prepaid expenses increased at January 28, 2017 primarily as a result of a $4.4 million increase in prepaid taxes as well as higher prepaid advertising and the prepaid expenses associated with the Southern Tide business which were partially offset by lower prepaid rent as of January 28, 2017 due to the timing of payment of rent amounts as February 2017 rent payments generally had not been paid as of January 28, 2017, but substantially all February 2016 rent payments had been made as of January 30, 2016.\nNon-current Assets: Table 76: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>January 28, 2017\n</td> <td>January 30, 2016\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property and equipment, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>193,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>184,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intangible assets, net\n</td> <td>175,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>143,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill\n</td> <td>60,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>248.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other non-current assets, net\n</td> <td>24,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-current assets, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>453,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>365,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProperty and equipment, net as of January 28, 2017 increased from January 30, 2016 primarily as a result of capital expenditures partially offset by depreciation expense.

The increase in other non-current assets, net as of January 28, 2017 was primarily due to an increase in asset balances set aside for potential deferred compensation plan obligations, non-current deferred tax assets due to the reversal of certain foreign operating loss carryforwards and deferred financing costs paid during Fiscal 2016.\nLiabilities: Table 77: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>January 28, 2017\n</td> <td>January 30, 2016\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Current Liabilities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>128,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt\n</td> <td>91,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>108.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other non-current liabilities\n</td> <td>70,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred taxes\n</td> <td>13,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>271.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liabilities related to discontinued operations\n</td> <td>2,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,027\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(44.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liabilities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>309,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>248,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCurrent liabilities as of January 28, 2017 were comparable to January 30, 2016 reflecting an $8.5 million increase in accounts payable and a $3.9 million increase in other accrued expenses and liabilities and a $0.5 million increase in liabilities related to discontinued operations partially offset by a $10.4 million decrease in accrued compensation. The increase in accounts payable was primarily due to an increase in payables related to imports in transit due to the timing of the Chinese New Year holiday, while the decrease in accrued compensation was due to a decrease in accrued bonus for each operating group as well as Corporate and Other.\nThe increase in debt as of January 28, 2017 was primarily due to the payment of $95.0 million related to acquisitions, $49.4 million of capital expenditures and the payment of $18.1 million of dividends which were partially offset by $118.6 million of cash flow from operations. Other non-current liabilities increased as of January 28, 2017 compared to January 30, 2016 primarily due to increases in deferred rent liabilities.\nDeferred taxes increased as of January 28, 2017 compared to January 30, 2016 primarily due to the impact of purchase accounting on the basis differences for the acquired assets of Southern Tide and timing differences associated with depreciation, amortization, accrued compensation and inventories. Non-current liabilities related to discontinued operations as of January 28, 2017 decreased primarily as a result of certain amounts now being classified as current liabilities, and included in total current liabilities, rather than non-current liabilities related to discontinued operations. The aggregate amount included in current and non-current liabilities related to discontinued operations represents our best estimate of the future net loss anticipated with respect to certain retained lease obligations as discussed in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements; however, the ultimate loss to be recognized remains uncertain as the amount of any sub-lease income is dependent upon a variety of factors including anticipated future sublease income and market rental amounts.\nStatement of Cash Flows\nThe following table sets forth the net cash flows, including continuing and discontinued operations, resulting in the change in our cash and cash equivalents (in thousands): Table 78: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2015\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(146,491\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(13,946\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(50,355\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>27,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(91,466\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(47,619\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(559\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(39\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,565\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash and cash equivalents on hand were $6.3 million and $6.3 million at January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016, respectively. Changes in cash flows in Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015 related to operating activities, investing activities and financing activities are discussed below.\nFiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015\nOperating Activities:\nIn Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015, operating activities provided $118.6 million and $105.4 million of cash, respectively. The cash flow from operating activities was primarily the result of net earnings for the relevant period adjusted, as applicable, for non-cash activities including depreciation, amortization, equity-based compensation and loss on sale of discontinued operations as well as the net impact of changes in deferred taxes and our working capital accounts. Working capital account changes, as well as deferred taxes, had a favorable impact on cash flow from operations in both Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015. In Fiscal 2016 the more significant changes in working capital accounts were a decrease in receivables, net and inventories, each of which increased cash flow from operations partially offset by the impact of an increase in other non-current assets and an increase in prepaid expenses. During Fiscal 2015 the more significant changes in working capital accounts were a decrease in receivables and an increase in non-current liabilities, each of which increased cash flow from operations, partially offset by increases in inventories and prepaid expenses each of which decreased cash flow from operations.\nInvesting Activities:\nDuring Fiscal 2016, investing activities used $146.5 million of cash, while in Fiscal 2015, investing activities used $13.9 million of cash. In Fiscal 2016, we paid $95.0 million of cash for acquisitions, consisting of $92.0 million for the acquisition of Southern Tide and $3.1 million for certain acquisitions in our Lanier Apparel operating group, $49.4 million for capital expenditures and $2.0 million for the final working capital settlement associated with our Ben Sherman discontinued operations. The capital expenditures in Fiscal 2016 primarily consisted of opening, relocating and remodeling full-price retail stores and restaurants, information technology initiatives, including e-commerce capabilities, and facility enhancements for distribution centers and office locations. During Fiscal 2015, we used $73.1 million of cash for capital expenditures which primarily related to costs associated with new full-price retail stores and restaurants; facility enhancements, including the build-out of Tommy Bahama's new office in Seattle and the acquisition of additional distribution center space for our Lilly Pulitzer business; information technology initiatives, including e-commerce enhancements; and full-price retail store remodeling. Additionally, during Fiscal 2015, we received $59.3 million of proceeds for the sale of our Ben Sherman business. Other investing activities in Fiscal 2015 include the net impact of a $1.1 million investment of cash in an unconsolidated entity, partially offset by the $0.9 million proceeds from the sale of real estate.\nFinancing Activities:\nDuring Fiscal 2016, financing activities provided $27.4 million of cash while in Fiscal 2015 financing activities used $91.5 million of cash. In Fiscal 2016, we increased debt primarily for the purpose of purchasing the Southern Tide business, funding our capital expenditures and payment of dividends, which in the aggregate exceeded our cash flow from operations. During Fiscal 2015, we decreased debt as cash provided by our operating activities and the proceeds from the sale of Ben Sherman exceeded our cash requirements for capital expenditures, contingent consideration payments and dividends. During Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015, we paid $18.1 million and $16.6 million of dividends, respectively. In Fiscal 2015, we also paid $12.5 million for the final payment for the contingent consideration arrangement related to the Lilly Pulitzer acquisition.\nWe anticipate that cash flow provided by or used in financing activities in the future will be dependent upon whether our cash flow from operating activities exceeds our capital expenditures, dividend payments and any other investing or financing activities. Generally, we anticipate that excess cash, if any, will be used to repay debt on our U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement.\nFiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014\nOperating Activities:\nIn Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014, operating activities provided $105.4 million and $95.4 million of cash, respectively. The cash flow from operating activities was primarily the result of net earnings for the relevant period adjusted, as applicable, for non-cash activities including depreciation, amortization, equity-based compensation and loss on sale of discontinued operations as well as the net impact of changes in our working capital accounts. In Fiscal 2015 the more significant changes in working capital accounts were a decrease in receivables and an increase in non-current liabilities, each of which increased cash flow from operations, partially offset by increases in inventories and prepaid expenses each of which decreased cash flow from operations. In Fiscal 2014 the more significant changes in working capital were increases in current liabilities and non-current liabilities, each of which increased cash flow from operations, partially offset by increases in receivables and inventories, each of which decreased cash flow from operations.\nInvesting Activities:\nDuring Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014, investing activities used $13.9 million and $50.4 million of cash, respectively. In Fiscal 2015, we used $73.1 million of cash for capital expenditures and received $59.3 million of proceeds for the sale of our Ben Sherman business. Other investing activities in Fiscal 2015 include the net impact of a $1.1 million investment of cash in an unconsolidated entity, partially offset by the $0.9 million proceeds from the sale of real estate. In Fiscal 2014, investing cash flow activities consisted of purchases of property and equipment, which were primarily related to costs associated with new full-price retail stores, information technology initiatives and full-price retail store and restaurant remodeling.\nFinancing Activities:\nDuring Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014, financing activities used $91.5 million and $47.6 million of cash, respectively. In Fiscal 2015, we decreased debt as cash provided by our operating activities and the proceeds from the sale of Ben Sherman exceeded our cash requirements for capital expenditures, contingent consideration payments and dividends. In Fiscal 2014, we also decreased debt as cash provided by our operating activities exceeded our cash needs for capital expenditures, dividends and contingent consideration payments. In Fiscal 2015, we paid dividends of $16.6 million and $12.5 million for the final payment for the contingent consideration arrangement related to the Lilly Pulitzer acquisition, while in Fiscal 2014 we paid dividends of $13.9 million and contingent consideration of $2.5 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe had $91.5 million outstanding as of January 28, 2017 under our $325 million Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (\"U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement\") compared to $44.0 million of borrowings outstanding as of January 30, 2016 under our Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (\"Prior Credit Agreement\"). On May 24, 2016, the U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement amended and restated the Prior Credit Agreement to (i) increase the borrowing capacity of the facility, (ii) extend the maturity of the facility and (iii) modify certain other provisions and restrictions of the Prior Credit Agreement. The U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement generally (i) is limited to a borrowing base consisting of specified percentages of eligible categories of assets, (ii) accrues variable-rate interest (weighted average borrowing rate of 2.3% as of January 28, 2017), unused line fees and letter of credit fees based upon average unused availability or utilization, (iii) requires periodic interest payments with principal due at maturity (May 2021) and (iv) is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of Oxford Industries, Inc. and substantially all of its domestic subsidiaries, including accounts receivable, books and records, chattel paper, deposit accounts, equipment, certain general intangibles, inventory, investment property (including the equity interests of certain subsidiaries), negotiable collateral, life insurance policies, supporting obligations, commercial tort claims, cash and cash equivalents, eligible trademarks, proceeds and other personal property.\nTo the extent cash flow needs exceed cash flow provided by our operations we will have access, subject to its terms, to our U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement to provide funding for operating activities, capital expenditures and acquisitions, if any. Our credit facility is also used to finance trade letters of credit for product purchases, which reduce the amounts available under our line of credit when issued. As of January 28, 2017, $4.7 million of letters of credit were outstanding against our U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement. After considering these limitations and the amount of eligible assets in our borrowing base, as applicable, as of January 28, 2017, we had $185.5 million in unused availability under the U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement, subject to certain limitations on borrowings.\nCovenants, Other Restrictions and Prepayment Penalties\nThe U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement is subject to a number of affirmative covenants regarding the delivery of financial information, compliance with law, maintenance of property, insurance requirements and conduct of business. Also, the U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement is subject to certain negative covenants or other restrictions including, among other things, limitations on our ability to (i) incur debt, (ii) guaranty certain obligations, (iii) incur liens, (iv) pay dividends to shareholders, (v) repurchase shares of our common stock, (vi) make investments, (vii) sell assets or stock of subsidiaries, (viii) acquire assets or businesses, (ix) merge or consolidate with other companies or (x) prepay, retire, repurchase or redeem debt.\nAdditionally, the U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant that applies if excess availability under the agreement for three consecutive days is less than the greater of (i) $23.5 million or (ii) 10% of availability. In such case, our fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement must not be less than 1.0 to 1.0 for the immediately preceding 12 fiscal months for which financial statements have been delivered. This financial covenant continues to apply until we have maintained excess availability under the U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement of more than the greater of (i) $23.5 million or (ii) 10% of availability for 30 consecutive days.\nWe believe that the affirmative covenants, negative covenants, financial covenants and other restrictions under the U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement are customary for those included in similar facilities entered into at the time we entered into the U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement. During Fiscal 2016 and as of January 28, 2017, no financial covenant testing was required pursuant to our U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement or Prior Credit Agreement as the minimum availability threshold was met at all times. As of January 28, 2017, we were compliant with all covenants related to the U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement.\nOther Liquidity Items:\nWe anticipate that we will be able to satisfy our ongoing cash requirements, which generally consist of working capital and other operating activity needs, capital expenditures, interest payments on our debt and dividends, if any, primarily from positive cash flow from operations supplemented by borrowings under our U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement. Our need for working capital is typically seasonal with the greatest requirements generally in the fall and spring of each year. Our capital needs will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the need to finance inventory levels and the success of our various products. We anticipate that at the maturity of the U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement or as otherwise deemed appropriate, we will be able to refinance the facility or obtain other financing on terms available in the market at that time. The terms of any future financing arrangements may not be as favorable as the terms of the current agreement or current market terms.\nWe have paid dividends in each quarter since we became a public company in July 1960. However, we may discontinue or modify dividend payments at any time if we determine that other uses of our capital, including payment of outstanding debt, funding of acquisitions, funding of capital expenditures or repurchases of outstanding shares, may be in our best interest; if our expectations of future cash flows and future cash needs outweigh the ability to pay a dividend; or if the terms of our U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement, other debt instruments or applicable law limit our ability to pay dividends. We may borrow to fund dividends in the short term based on our expectation of operating cash flows in future periods subject to the terms and conditions of the U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement, other debt instruments and applicable law. All cash flow from operations will not be paid out as dividends in all periods. For details about limitations on our ability to pay dividends, see the discussion of the U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement above.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations, as of January 28, 2017, by future period (in thousands): Table 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Less Than\n1 year\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>3-5 Years\n</td> <td>More Than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (2)\n</td> <td>66,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>474,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum royalty and advertising payments pursuant to royalty agreements\n</td> <td>5,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Letters of credit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (3)(4)(5)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>117,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>175,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>501,698\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Principal and interest amounts payable in future periods on our U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement have been excluded from the table above, as the amount that will be outstanding and interest rate during any fiscal year will be dependent upon future events which are not known at this time.

As the results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods, scheduling deferred income tax amounts by period could be misleading.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Our anticipated capital expenditures for Fiscal 2017, which are excluded from the table above as we are generally not contractually obligated to pay these amounts as of January 28, 2017, are expected to be approximately $55 million. These expenditures are expected to consist primarily of costs associated with information technology initiatives, including e-commerce capabilities; opening, relocating and remodeling full-price retail stores and restaurants; and facilities enhancements. Our capital expenditure amounts in future years may increase or decrease from the amounts incurred in prior years or the amount expected for Fiscal 2017 depending on the information technology initiatives, full-price retail store and restaurant openings, relocations and remodels and other infrastructure requirements deemed appropriate for that year to support future expansion of our businesses.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into agreements which meet the SEC's definition of an off balance sheet financing arrangement, other than operating leases, and have made no financial commitments to or guarantees with respect to any unconsolidated subsidiaries or special purpose entities.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP in a consistent manner. The preparation of these financial statements requires the selection and application of accounting policies. Further, the application of GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those discussed below. We base our estimates on historical experience, current trends and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nActual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe it is possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same set of facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts. We believe that we have appropriately applied our critical accounting policies. However, in the event that inappropriate assumptions or methods were used relating to the critical accounting policies below, our consolidated statements of operations could be misstated.\nA detailed summary of significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this report. The following is a brief discussion of the more significant estimates, assumptions and judgments we use or the amounts most sensitive to change from outside factors.\nRevenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable\nOur revenue consists of direct to consumer sales, which includes retail store, e-commerce and restaurant sales, as well as wholesale sales. We consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, (2) delivery has occurred, (3) our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and (4) collectibility is reasonably assured.\nAn area of judgment affecting reported revenues and net earnings involves estimating sales reserves, which represent a portion of revenues not expected to be realized. We record our revenues net of estimated discounts, allowances, co-operative advertising, operational chargebacks and returns, as appropriate. As certain allowances and other deductions are not finalized until the end of a season, program or other event which may not have occurred yet, we estimate such discounts and allowances on an ongoing basis. Significant considerations in determining our estimates for discounts, allowances, operational chargebacks and returns for wholesale customers may include historical and current trends, agreements with customers, projected seasonal results, an evaluation of current economic conditions, specific program or product expectations and retailer performance. Actual discounts and allowances to our wholesale customers have not differed materially from our estimates in prior periods. As of January 28, 2017, our total reserves for discounts, returns and allowances for our wholesale businesses were $9.3 million and, therefore, if the allowances changed by 10% it would have had a pre-tax impact of $0.9 million on earnings in Fiscal 2016. The substantial majority of these reserves relate to our Lanier Apparel business as of January 28, 2017.\nAs direct to consumer products may be returned after the date of original purchase by the consumer, we must make estimates of reserves for products which were sold prior to the balance sheet date but that we anticipate may be returned by the consumer subsequent to that date. The determination of direct to consumer return reserve amounts requires judgment and consideration of historical and current trends, evaluation of current economic trends and other factors. Our historical estimates of direct to consumer return reserves have not differed materially from actual results. As of January 28, 2017, our direct to consumer return reserve was $3.0 million. A 10% change in the direct to consumer return reserve as of January 28, 2017 would have had a $0.3 million pre-tax impact on earnings in Fiscal 2016.\nFor our wholesale receiveables, we recognize estimated reserves for bad debts based on our historical collection experience, the financial condition of our customers, an evaluation of current economic conditions and anticipated trends, each of which is subjective and requires certain assumptions. Actual charges for uncollectible amounts have not differed materially from our estimates in prior periods. As of January 28, 2017, our allowance for doubtful accounts was $0.8 million, and therefore, if the allowance for doubtful accounts changed by 10% it would have had a pre-tax impact of $0.1 million on earnings in Fiscal 2016. While the amounts deemed uncollectible have not been significant in recent years if, in the future, amounts due from significant customer(s) were deemed to be uncollectible as a result of events that occur subsequent to January 28, 2017 this could result in a material charge to our consolidated statements of operations in future periods.\nInventories, net\nFor operating group reporting, inventory is carried at the lower of the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method cost or market. We continually evaluate the composition of our inventories, substantially all of which is finished goods inventory, for identification of distressed inventory. In performing this evaluation we consider slow-turning products, an indication of lack of consumer acceptance of particular products, prior seasons' fashion products and current levels of replenishment program products as compared to future sales estimates. We estimate the amount of goods that we will not be able to sell in the normal course of business and write down the value of these goods as necessary. As the amount to be ultimately realized for the goods is not necessarily known at period end, we must utilize certain assumptions considering historical experience, inventory quantity, quality, age and mix, historical sales trends, future sales projections, consumer and retailer preferences, market trends, general economic conditions and our plans to sell the inventory. Also, we provide an allowance for shrinkage, as appropriate, for the period between the last count and each balance sheet date. Historically, our estimates of inventory markdowns and inventory shrinkage have not varied significantly from actual results.\nFor consolidated financial reporting, $133.8 million, or 94%, of our inventories are valued at the lower of last-in, first-out (LIFO) method cost or market after deducting the $58.1 million LIFO reserve as of January 28, 2017. The remaining $8.4 million of our inventories are valued at the lower of FIFO cost or market as of January 28, 2017. LIFO reserves are based on the Producer Price Index (PPI) as published by the United States Department of Labor. We write down inventories valued at the lower of LIFO cost or market when LIFO cost exceeds market value. We deem LIFO accounting adjustments to not only include changes in the LIFO reserve, but also changes in markdown reserves which are considered in LIFO accounting. As our LIFO inventory pool does not correspond to our operating group definitions, LIFO inventory accounting adjustments are not\nallocated to the respective operating groups. Thus, the impact of accounting for inventories on the LIFO method is reflected in Corporate and Other for operating group reporting purposes.\nAs of January 28, 2017, we had recorded a reserve of $2.2 million related to inventory on the lower of FIFO cost or market method and for inventory on the lower of LIFO cost or market method with markdowns in excess of our LIFO reserve. A 10% change in the amount of such markdowns would have a pre-tax impact of $0.2 million on earnings in Fiscal 2016. A change in the markdowns of our inventory valued at the lower of LIFO cost or market method that is not marked down in excess of our LIFO reserve typically would not be expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. A change in inventory levels, or the mix by inventory category, at the end of future fiscal years compared to inventory balances as of January 28, 2017 could result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as such a change may erode portions of our earlier base year layers for purposes of making our annual LIFO computation. Additionally, a change in the PPI as published by the United States Department of Labor as compared to the indexes as of January 28, 2017 could result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as inflation or deflation would change the amount of our LIFO reserve.\nGiven the significant amount of uncertainties surrounding the year-end LIFO calculation, including the estimate of year-end inventory balances, the proportion of inventory in each inventory category and the year-end PPI, we typically do not adjust our LIFO reserve in the first three quarters of a fiscal year. This policy may result in significant LIFO accounting adjustments in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year resulting from the year over year changes in inventory levels, the PPI and markdown reserves. We do recognize on a quarterly basis during each of the first three quarters of the fiscal year changes in markdown reserves as those amounts can be estimated on a quarterly basis.\nAccounting for business combinations requires that assets and liabilities, including inventories, are recorded at fair value at acquisition. In accordance with GAAP, the definition of fair value of inventories acquired generally will equal the expected sales price less certain costs associated with selling the inventory, which may exceed the actual cost of producing the acquired inventories. Based on the inventory turn of the acquired inventories, amounts are recognized as additional cost of goods sold in the periods subsequent to the acquisition as the acquired inventory is sold in the ordinary course of business. In determining the fair value of the acquired inventory, as well as the appropriate period to recognize the charge in our consolidated statements of operations as the acquired inventory is sold, we must make certain assumptions regarding costs incurred prior to acquisition for the acquired inventory, an appropriate profit allowance, estimates of the costs to sell the inventory and the timing of the sale of the acquired inventory. Such estimates involve significant uncertainty, and the use of different assumptions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets, net\nThe cost of each acquired business is allocated to the individual tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed or incurred as a result of the acquisition based on their estimated fair values. The assessment of the estimated fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires us to make certain assumptions regarding the use of the acquired assets, anticipated cash flows, probabilities of cash flows, discount rates and other factors. In most of our acquisitions, significant intangible assets and goodwill were acquired resulting in $175.2 million of intangible assets and $60.0 million of goodwill in our consolidated balance sheet as of January 28, 2017.\nOur intangibles assets primarily consist of trademarks, reacquired rights and customer relationships. Goodwill is recognized as the amount by which the cost to acquire a company or group of assets exceeds the fair value of assets acquired less any liabilities assumed at acquisition. See Note 4 in our consolidated financial statements included in this report for further details about our various intangible assets and goodwill amounts.\nThe fair values and useful lives of these intangible assets and goodwill are estimated based on our assessment as well as independent third party appraisals in some cases. Such valuations, which are dependent upon a number of uncertain factors, may include a discounted cash flow analysis of anticipated revenues and expenses or cost savings resulting from the acquired intangible asset using an estimate of a risk-adjusted market-based cost of capital as the discount rate. The valuation of intangible assets and goodwill requires significant judgment due to the variety of uncertain factors, including planned use of the intangible assets as well as estimates of net sales, royalty income, operating income, growth rates, royalty rates for the trademarks, discount rates and income tax rates, among other factors. The use of different assumptions related to these uncertain factors at acquisition could result in a material change to the amounts of intangible assets initially recorded at acquisition, which could result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nTrademarks with indefinite lives and goodwill are not amortized but instead evaluated, either qualitatively or quantitatively, for impairment annually as of the first day of the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the intangible asset or goodwill might be impaired. The evaluation of the recoverability of trademarks with indefinite lives and goodwill includes valuations based on a discounted cash flow analysis which is typically\nsimilar to the analysis performed at acquisition. This approach is dependent upon a number of uncertain factors, including those used in the initial valuation of the intangible assets and goodwill listed above. Such estimates involve significant uncertainty, and if our plans or anticipated results change, the impact on our financial statements could be significant. If this analysis indicates an impairment of a trademark with an indefinite useful life, the amount of the impairment is recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on the amount that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset.\nAmortization of intangible assets with finite lives, which primarily consist of reacquired rights and customer relationships, is recognized over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method of amortization or another method of amortization that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise realized. We amortize our intangible assets with finite lives for periods of up to 20 years. The determination of an appropriate useful life for amortization is based on the remaining contractual period, as applicable, our plans for the intangible asset as well as factors outside of our control, including customer attrition. Intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment periodically if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If expected future discounted cash flows from operations are less than their carrying amounts, an asset is determined to be impaired and a loss is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Amortization related to intangible assets with finite lives totaled $2.2 million during Fiscal 2016 and is anticipated to be approximately $2.2 million in Fiscal 2017.\nIntangible asses and goodwill acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, primarily due to the fact that they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and macroeconomic conditions present at the time of acquisition. Consequently if operating results, plans for the acquired business and/or macroeconomic conditions change after an acquisition, it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets. A change in macroeconomic conditions may not only impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models but may also impact other assumptions used in our analysis, including but not limited to, the risk-adjusted market-based cost of capital and/or discount rates. Additionally, we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical market participant would use. Therefore the cost of capital discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends regardless of whether our actual cost of capital changed. As we acquired Southern Tide in Fiscal 2016 and recorded a significant amount of intangible assets and goodwill related to this acquisition the assets recognized are more sensitive to changes in assumptions than our other intangible assets and goodwill amounts.\nIn Fiscal 2016, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014, no impairment charges related to intangible assets or goodwill were recognized.\nOther Fair Value Measurements\nFor many assets and liabilities the determination of fair value may not require the use of many assumptions or other estimates. However, in some cases the assumptions or inputs associated with the determination of fair value as of a measurement date may require the use of many assumptions and may be internally derived or otherwise unobservable. We utilize certain market-based and internally derived information and make assumptions about the information in determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired as part of a business combination, as well as in other circumstances, adjusting previously recorded assets and liabilities to fair value at each balance sheet date, including the fair value of any contingent consideration obligations and any lease loss obligations incurred, and assessing recognized assets for impairment, including intangible assets, goodwill and property and equipment as discussed above.\nAs noted above, the cost of each acquired business is allocated to the individual tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed or incurred as a result of the acquisition based on its estimated fair value. The assessment of the estimated fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires us to make certain assumptions regarding the use of the acquired assets, anticipated cash flows, probabilities of cash flows, discount rates and other factors. To the extent information to revise the allocation becomes available during the allocation period the allocation of the purchase price will be adjusted. Should information become available after the allocation period indicating that adjustments to the allocation are appropriate, those adjustments will be included in operating results.\nFor the determination of fair value for assets and liabilities acquired as part of a business combination, adjusting previously recorded assets and liabilities to fair value at each balance sheet date and assessing, and possibly adjusting, recognized assets for impairment, the assumptions, or the timing of changes in these assumptions, that we make regarding the valuation of these assets could differ significantly from the assumptions made by other parties. The use of different assumptions could result in materially different valuations for the respective assets and liabilities, which would impact our consolidated financial statements.\nIn connection with certain acquisitions, we have entered into contingent consideration arrangements to compensate the sellers if certain targets are achieved. For a contingent consideration arrangement, if any, as of the date of acquisition we must determine the fair value of the contingent consideration which would estimate the discounted fair value of any expected\npayments. Such valuation requires assumptions regarding anticipated cash flows, probabilities of cash flows, discount rates and other factors, each requiring a significant amount of judgment. Subsequent to the date of acquisition, we are required to periodically adjust the liability for the contingent consideration to reflect the fair value of the contingent consideration by reassessing any valuation assumptions as of the balance sheet date.\nFrom time to time, we may recognize certain obligations related to certain leased space associated with exiting retail or office space. In these cases, we must determine the net loss related to the space if the anticipated cash outflows for the space exceed the estimated cash inflows related to the space. While estimated cash outflows are generally known since there is an underlying lease, the estimated cash inflows for sublease rental income and other costs are often very subjective if there is not a sub-lease agreement in place at that time since those amounts are dependent upon many factors including, but not limited to, whether a sub-tenant will be obtained, the time required to obtain the sub-tenant as well as the rent payments and any tenant allowances agreed with the sub-tenant as part of the future lease negotiations. Also, it is possible that we could negotiate a lease termination in the future that would differ from the amount of the required payments pursuant to the lease agreement.\nAs of January 30, 2016, we have amounts in non-current liabilities related to discontinued operations totaling $5.4 million related to retained leases associated with our former Ben Sherman operations. In Fiscal 2016 we took a charge of $2.8 million related to these retained lease obligations based on our updated assessment of the losses associated with the retained lease obligations. As we do not currently have a sub-lease tenant identified for the spaces or negotiated lease terminations with landlords, we have made certain assumptions about the estimated cash inflows that could partially offset cash outflows for the in-place leases. Our estimate of the liability related to the lease could change significantly as we obtain better information in the future or if our current assumptions do not materialize. The assumptions made by another party related to such leases could be different than the assumptions made by us. See Note 13 in our consolidated financial statements included in this report for further discussion of discontinued operations and the related lease obligations.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, taxable income in carryback years, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. Valuation allowances are established when we determine that it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nValuation allowances, which total $4.1 million as of January 28, 2017, are analyzed periodically and adjusted as events occur or circumstances change that would indicate adjustments to the valuation allowances are appropriate. Valuation allowance amounts could have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations in the future if assumptions related to valuation allowances changed significantly. Additionally, the timing of recognition of a valuation allowance or any reversal of a valuation allowance requires a significant amount of judgment to assess all the positive and negative evidence, particularly when operating results in the respective jurisdiction have changed or are expected to change from losses to income or from income to losses. As realization of deferred tax assets and liabilities is dependent upon future taxable income in specific jurisdictions, changes in tax laws and rates and shifts in the amount of taxable income among state and foreign jurisdictions may have a significant impact on the amount of benefit ultimately realized for deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nAs a global company, we are subject to income taxes in a number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions. Therefore, our income tax provision involves many uncertainties due to not only the timing differences of income for financial statement reporting and tax return reporting, but also the application of complex tax laws and regulations, which are subject to interpretation and management judgment. The use of different assumptions or a change in our assumptions related to book to tax timing differences, our determination of whether foreign investments or earnings are permanently reinvested, the ability to realize uncertain tax positions, the appropriateness of valuation allowances, a reduction in valuation allowances or other considerations, transfer pricing practices, the impact of our tax planning strategies and the jurisdictions or significance of earnings in future periods each could have a significant impact on our income tax rate. Additionally, factors impacting income taxes including changes in tax laws or interpretations, court case decisions, statute of limitation expirations or audit settlements could have a significant impact on our income tax rate. An increase in our consolidated income tax rate from 37.0% to 38.0% during Fiscal 2016 would have reduced net earnings by $0.9 million.\nIncome tax expense recorded during interim periods is generally based on the expected tax rate for the year, considering projections of earnings and book to tax differences as of the balance sheet date, subject to certain limitations associated with separate foreign jurisdiction losses in interim periods. The tax rate ultimately realized for the year may increase or decrease due to actual operating results or book to tax differences varying from the amounts on which our interim calculations were based. Any changes in assumptions related to the need for a valuation allowance, the ability to realize an uncertain tax position, changes in enacted tax rates, the expected operating results in total or by jurisdiction for the year, or other assumptions are accounted for in the period in which the change occurs. As certain of our foreign operations are in a loss position and\nrealization of a future benefit for the losses is uncertain, a significant variance in losses in such jurisdictions from our expectations can have a significant impact on our expected annual tax rate. The recognition of the benefit of losses expected to be realized may be limited in an interim period and may require adjustments to tax expense in the interim period that yield an effective tax rate for the interim period that is not representative of the expected tax rate for the full year.\nSee Note 8 in our consolidated financial statements included in this report for further discussion of income taxes.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRefer to Note 1 in our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB that we have not yet adopted that are expected to possibly have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nSEASONALITY\nEach of our operating groups is impacted by seasonality as the demand by specific product or style, as well as by distribution channel, may vary significantly depending on the time of year. For information regarding the seasonality impact on individual operating groups and for our total company, see Part I, Item 1, Business, included in this report.", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I understand your request.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our operations, cash flows, liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements contained in this report.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a global apparel company that designs, sources, markets and distributes products bearing the trademarks of our Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide lifestyle brands, other owned brands and licensed brands as well as private label apparel products. During Fiscal 2016, 92% of our net sales were from products bearing brands that we own and 66% of our net sales were through our direct to consumer channels of distribution. In Fiscal 2015, 96% of our consolidated net sales were to customers located in the United States, with the sales outside the United States consisting primarily of our Tommy Bahama products in Canada and the Asia-Pacific region.\nOur business strategy is to develop and market compelling lifestyle brands and products that evoke a strong emotional response from our target consumers. We consider lifestyle brands to be those brands that have a clearly defined and targeted point of view inspired by an appealing lifestyle or attitude. Furthermore, we believe lifestyle brands like Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide that create an emotional connection with consumers can command greater loyalty and higher price points at retail and create licensing opportunities, which may drive higher earnings. We believe the attraction of a lifestyle brand depends on creating compelling product, effectively communicating the respective lifestyle brand message and distributing products to consumers where and when they want it.\nOur ability to compete successfully in styling and marketing is directly related to our proficiency in foreseeing changes and trends in fashion and consumer preference, and presenting appealing products for consumers. Our design-led, commercially informed lifestyle brand operations strive to provide exciting, differentiated products each season.\nTo further strengthen each lifestyle brand's connections with consumers, we directly communicate with consumers through electronic and print media on a regular basis. We believe our ability to effectively communicate the images, lifestyle and products of our brands and create an emotional connection with consumers is critical to the success of the brands. Our advertising for our brands often attempts to convey the lifestyle of the brand as well as a specific product.\nWe distribute our owned lifestyle branded products primarily through our direct to consumer channels, consisting of our Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer retail stores and our e-commerce sites for Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide, and through our wholesale distribution channels. Our direct to consumer operations provide us with the opportunity to interact directly with our customers, present to them a broad assortment of our current season products and immerse them in the theme of the lifestyle brand. We believe that presenting our products in a setting specifically designed to showcase the lifestyle on which the brands are based enhances the image of our brands. Our Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer full-price retail stores provide high visibility for our brands and products, and allow us to stay close to the preferences of our consumers, while also providing a platform for long-term growth for the brands. In Tommy Bahama, we also operate a limited number of restaurants, generally adjacent to a Tommy Bahama full-price retail store location, which we believe further enhance the brand's image with consumers.\nAdditionally, our e-commerce websites, which represented 18% of our consolidated net sales in Fiscal 2016, provide the opportunity to increase revenues by reaching a larger population of consumers and at the same time allow our brands to provide a broader range of products. Our e-commerce flash clearance sales on our websites and our Tommy Bahama outlet stores play an important role in overall brand and inventory management by allowing us to sell discontinued and out-of-season products in brand appropriate settings and often at better prices than are typically available from third party off-price retailers.\nThe wholesale operations of our lifestyle brands complement our direct to consumer operations and provide access to a larger group of consumers. As we seek to maintain the integrity of our lifestyle brands by limiting promotional activity in our full-price retail stores and e-commerce websites, we generally target wholesale customers that follow this same approach in their stores. Our wholesale customers for our Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide brands include better department stores and specialty stores, including Signature Stores for Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide.\nWithin our Lanier Apparel operating group, we sell tailored clothing and sportswear products under licensed brands, private labels and owned brands. Lanier Apparel's customers include department stores, discount and off-price retailers, warehouse clubs, national chains, specialty retailers and others throughout the United States.\nAll of our operating groups operate in highly competitive apparel markets in which numerous U.S.-based and foreign apparel firms compete. No single apparel firm or small group of apparel firms dominates the apparel industry, and our direct competitors vary by operating group and distribution channel. We believe the principal competitive factors in the apparel industry are reputation, value, and image of brand names; design; consumer preference; price; quality; marketing; product fulfillment capabilities; and customer service.\nThe apparel industry is cyclical and very dependent upon the overall level and focus of discretionary consumer spending, which changes as regional, domestic and international economic conditions change. Often, negative economic conditions have a longer and more severe impact on the apparel industry than on other industries. We believe current global\neconomic conditions and the resulting economic uncertainty continue to impact our business, and the apparel industry as a whole.\nWe believe the retail apparel market is evolving very rapidly and in ways that are having a disruptive impact on traditional fashion retailing. The application of technology, including the internet and mobile devices, to fashion retail provides consumers increasing access to multiple, responsive distribution platforms and an unprecedented ability to communicate directly with brands, retailers and others. As a result, consumers have more information and broader, faster and cheaper access to goods than they have ever had before. This, along with the coming of age of the millennial\u201d generation, is revolutionizing the way that consumers shop for fashion and other goods. The evidence is increasingly apparent with marked weakness in department stores and mall-based retailers, decreased consumer retail traffic, a more promotional retail environment, expansion of off-price and discount retailers, and growing internet purchases.\nWhile this evolution in the fashion retail industry presents significant risks, especially for traditional retailers who fail or are unable to adapt, we believe it also presents a tremendous opportunity for brands and retailers. We believe our brands have attributes that are true competitive advantages in this new retailing paradigm and we are leveraging technology to serve our consumers when and where they want to be served. We continue to believe that our lifestyle brands are well suited to succeed and thrive in the long term while managing the various challenges facing our industry.\nSpecifically, we believe our lifestyle brands have opportunities for long-term growth in their direct to consumer businesses. We anticipate increased sales in our e-commerce operations, which are expected to grow at a faster rate than bricks and mortar comparable full-price retail store sales. This growth can also be achieved through prudent expansion of bricks and mortar full-price retail store operations and modest comparable full-price retail store sales increases. Despite the changes in the retail environment, we expect there will continue to be desirable locations to increase our store count.\nOur lifestyle brands also have an opportunity for modest sales increases in their wholesale businesses in the long term primarily from current customers adding to their existing door count and increasing their on-line business, increased sales to on-line retailers and the selective addition of new wholesale customers who generally follow a retail model with limited discounting; however, we must be diligent in our effort to avoid compromising the integrity of the brand by maintaining or growing sales with wholesale customers that may not be aligned with our long-term strategy. This is particularly important with the challenges in the department store channel, which represents about one-half of our consolidated wholesale sales, or 16% of our consolidated net sales. We also believe that there are opportunities for modest sales growth for Lanier Apparel in the future through new product programs for existing and new customers.\nWe believe we must continue to invest in our lifestyle brands to take advantage of their long-term growth opportunities. Investments include capital expenditures primarily related to the direct to consumer operations such as technology enhancements, e-commerce initiatives, full-price retail store and restaurant build-out for new and relocated locations as well as remodels, and distribution center and administrative office expansion initiatives. Additionally, while we anticipate increased employment, advertising and other costs in key functions to support the ongoing business operations and fuel future sales growth, we remain focused on appropriately managing our operating expenses.\nIn the midst of the challenges in our industry, an important focus for us in Fiscal 2017 is advancing various initiatives to increase the profitability of the Tommy Bahama business. These initiatives generally focus on increasing gross margin and operating margin through efforts such as: product cost reductions; selective price increases; reducing inventory purchases; more rapidly clearing excess inventory; redefining our approach to inventory clearance; effectively managing controllable and discretionary operating expenses; taking a more conservative approach to full-price retail store and outlet openings and renewals; and continuing our efforts to reduce Asia-Pacific operating losses.\nWe continue to believe it is important to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity. We believe positive cash flow from operations in the future coupled with the strength of our balance sheet and liquidity will provide us with sufficient resources to fund future investments in our owned lifestyle brands. While we believe we have significant opportunities to appropriately deploy our capital and resources in our existing lifestyle brands, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to add additional lifestyle brands to our portfolio if we identify appropriate targets which meet our investment criteria.\nImportant factors relating to certain risks, many of which are beyond our ability to control or predict, which could impact our business are described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report.\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated operating results from continuing operations (in thousands, except per share amounts) for Fiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015: \nThe primary reasons for the lower earnings from continuing operations per diluted share in Fiscal 2016 were the lower operating income in Tommy Bahama and increased interest expense partially offset by higher income in Lilly Pulitzer, improved operating results in Corporate and Other and a lower effective tax rate.\nSouthern Tide Acquisition\nOn April 19, 2016, we acquired Southern Tide, LLC, which owns the Southern Tide lifestyle apparel brand. Southern Tide carries an extensive selection of men's shirts, pants, shorts, outerwear, ties, swimwear, footwear and accessories, as well as a women's collection. The brand's products are sold through its wholesale operations to specialty stores, department stores and Southern Tide Signature Stores as well as through its direct to consumer operations on the Southern Tide website. The purchase price for the acquisition was $85 million in cash, subject to adjustment based on net working capital as of the closing date for the acquisition. We used borrowings under our revolving credit facility to finance the transaction. For additional information about the Southern Tide acquisition, refer to Part I, Item 1. Business and Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, both included in this report.\nOPERATING GROUPS\nOur business is primarily operated through our Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer, Lanier Apparel and Southern Tide operating groups. We identify our operating groups based on the way our management organizes the components of our business for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. Our operating group structure reflects a brand-focused management approach, emphasizing operational coordination and resource allocation across each brand's direct to consumer, wholesale and licensing operations, as applicable.\nTommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide each design, source, market and distribute apparel and related products bearing their respective trademarks and also license their trademarks for other product categories, while Lanier Apparel designs, sources and distributes branded and private label men's tailored clothing, sportswear and other products. Corporate and Other is a reconciling category for reporting purposes and includes our corporate offices, substantially all financing activities, elimination of inter-segment sales, LIFO inventory accounting adjustments, other costs that are not allocated to the operating groups and operations of our other businesses which are not included in our operating groups, including our Lyons, Georgia distribution center operations. Our LIFO inventory pool does not correspond to our operating group definitions; therefore, LIFO inventory accounting adjustments are not allocated to our operating groups.\nFor additional information about each of our operating groups, see Part I, Item 1. Business and Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, both included in this report.\nCOMPARABLE STORE SALES\nWe often disclose comparable store sales in order to provide additional information regarding changes in our results of operations between periods. Our disclosures of comparable store sales include net sales from full-price retail stores and our e-commerce sites, excluding sales associated with e-commerce flash clearance sales. We believe that the inclusion of both our full-price retail stores and e-commerce sites in the comparable store sales disclosures is a more meaningful way of reporting our comparable store sales results, given similar inventory planning, allocation and return policies, as well as our cross-channel marketing and other initiatives for the direct to consumer channel. For our comparable store sales disclosures, we exclude (1) outlet store sales, warehouse sales and e-commerce flash clearance sales, as those clearance sales are used primarily to liquidate end of season inventory, which may vary significantly depending on the level of end of season inventory on hand and generally occur at lower gross margins than our non-clearance direct to consumer sales, and (2) restaurant sales, as we do not currently believe that the inclusion of restaurant sales is meaningful in assessing our consolidated results of operations. Comparable store sales information reflects net sales, including shipping and handling revenues, if any, associated with product sales.\nFor purposes of our disclosures, we consider a comparable store to be, in addition to our e-commerce sites, a physical full-price retail store that was owned and open as of the beginning of the prior fiscal year and which did not have during the relevant periods, and is not within the current fiscal year scheduled to have, (1) a remodel resulting in the store being closed for an extended period of time (which we define as a period of two weeks or longer), (2) a greater than 15% change in the size of the retail space due to expansion, reduction or relocation to a new retail space, (3) a relocation to a new space that was significantly different from the prior retail space, or (4) a closing or opening of a Tommy Bahama restaurant adjacent to the full-price retail store. For those stores which are excluded from comparable stores based on the preceding sentence, the stores continue to be excluded from comparable store sales until the criteria for a new store is met subsequent to the remodel, relocation or restaurant closing or opening. A store that is remodeled generally will continue to be included in our comparable store sales metrics as a store is not typically closed for a two week period during a remodel; however, in some cases a store may be closed for more than two weeks during a remodel. A store that is relocated generally will not be included in our comparable store sales metrics until that store has been open in the relocated space for the entirety of the prior fiscal year as the size or other characteristics of the store typically change significantly from the prior location. Additionally, any stores that were closed during the prior fiscal year or current fiscal year, or which we plan to close or vacate in the current fiscal year, are excluded from the definition of comparable store sales.\nDefinitions and calculations of comparable store sales differ among retail companies, and therefore comparable store sales metrics disclosed by us may not be comparable to the metrics disclosed by other companies.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth the specified line items in our consolidated statements of operations both in dollars (in thousands) and as a percentage of net sales. We have calculated all percentages based on actual data, but percentage columns may not add due to rounding. \nUnless otherwise indicated, all references to assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and other information in this report reflect continuing operations and exclude any amounts related to the discontinued operations of our former Ben Sherman operating group which we sold in Fiscal 2015. Refer to Note 13 in our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information about discontinued operations.\nFISCAL 2016 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2015\nThe discussion and tables below compare certain line items included in our statements of operations for Fiscal 2016 to Fiscal 2015. Each dollar and percentage change provided reflects the change between these periods unless indicated otherwise. Each dollar and share amount included in the tables is in thousands except for per share amounts. Individual line\nitems of our consolidated statements of operations may not be directly comparable to those of our competitors, as classification of certain expenses may vary by company.\nNet Sales\n\nConsolidated net sales increased $53.3 million, or 5.5%, in Fiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015. The increase in consolidated net sales was primarily driven by (1) the $27.4 million of net sales of Southern Tide, which was acquired on April 19, 2016, (2) an incremental net sales increase of $20.2 million associated with the operation of additional full-price retail stores in Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer, (3) a $7.0 million net increase in direct to consumer clearance sales reflecting an increase in e-commerce flash clearance sales at Lilly Pulitzer and decreases in outlet store sales at Tommy Bahama and (4) a $5.4 million increase in restaurant sales in Tommy Bahama. These sales increases were partially offset by a $6.5 million, or 2%, decrease in comparable store sales to $404.1 million in Fiscal 2016 from $410.6 million in Fiscal 2015 reflecting a decrease in comparable store sales at Tommy Bahama of 3% and an increase in comparable store sales at Lilly Pulitzer of 2%. We believe that certain macroeconomic factors, including lower retail store traffic, the evolving impact of digital technology on consumer shopping habits and the 2016 election cycle, impacted the sales in each of our direct to consumer and wholesale businesses in Fiscal 2016. The changes in net sales by operating group are discussed below.\nThe following table presents the proportion of our consolidated net sales by distribution channel for each period presented:\n\nTommy Bahama:\nThe Tommy Bahama net sales increase of $0.4 million, or 0.1%, was primarily driven by (1) an incremental net sales increase of $12.4 million associated with the operation of additional full-price retail stores and (2) a $5.4 million increase in restaurant sales primarily resulting from the impact of a full year of operations of the Waikiki restaurant in Fiscal 2016 and a modest increase at restaurants open for the full year of Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015. These sales increases were offset by (1) a $8.8 million, or 3%, decrease in comparable store sales to $302.5 million in Fiscal 2016 from $311.3 million in Fiscal 2015, (2) a $3.6 million decrease in net sales through our off-price direct to consumer clearance channels, primarily reflecting a decrease in sales in existing outlet stores, and (3) a $5.2 million decrease in wholesale sales. The decreases in the direct to consumer channels were primarily due to lower traffic in both our full-price retail stores and outlet stores. The decrease in wholesale sales reflects lower full-price wholesale sales reflecting the challenging environment of our wholesale department store and specialty store accounts.\nAs of January 28, 2017, we operated 168 Tommy Bahama stores globally, consisting of 111 full-price retail stores, 17 retail-restaurant locations and 40 outlet stores. As of January 30, 2016, we operated 164 Tommy Bahama stores consisting of 107 full-price retail stores, 16 retail-restaurant locations and 41 outlet stores. The following table presents the proportion of net sales by distribution channel for Tommy Bahama for each period presented:\n\nLilly Pulitzer:\nThe Lilly Pulitzer net sales increase of $28.7 million, or 14.0%, was primarily a result of (1) an incremental net sales increase of $11.2 million associated with the operation of additional full-price retail stores, (2) a $10.7 million increase in e-commerce flash clearance sales, (3) an $8.2 million increase in wholesale sales primarily resulting from increased orders from existing wholesale customers and (4) a $2.2 million, or 2%, increase in comparable store sales to $101.5 million in Fiscal 2016 compared to $99.3 million in Fiscal 2015. These sales increases were partially offset by a net $3.8 million decrease in warehouse sales as Lilly Pulitzer did not anniversary its June warehouse sale in 2016. As of January 28, 2017, we operated 40 Lilly Pulitzer full-price retail stores, after opening six new stores, acquiring one former Signature Store and closing one store during Fiscal 2016, compared to 34 full-price retail stores as of January 30, 2016. The following table presents the proportion of net sales by distribution channel for Lilly Pulitzer for each period presented:\n\nLanier Apparel:\nThe decrease in net sales for Lanier Apparel of $4.4 million, or 4.1%, was primarily due to lower sales of $6.5 million in the tailored clothing business partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in the sportswear business. The decreased sales in the tailored clothing business was primarily due to lower sales in certain programs including reductions in volume, shifts of timing and exits from various programs. These reductions in volume were partially offset by initial shipments and volume increases in other programs. The increased sales in the sportswear business were primarily due to increased volumes in private label sportswear programs.\nSouthern Tide:\nThe net sales of Southern Tide reflect the sales of Southern Tide for the period from the date of acquisition on April 19, 2016 through January 28, 2017. During the period from April 19, 2016 through January 28, 2017, 77% of Southern Tide's net sales were wholesale sales with the remainder of the sales consisting of e-commerce sales. We estimate that net sales in Fiscal 2017 will be in excess of $40 million, with about 75% to 80% of the sales consisting of wholesale sales and the remainder consisting of e-commerce sales on the Southern Tide website.\nCorporate and Other:\nCorporate and Other net sales primarily consist of the net sales of our Lyons, Georgia distribution center to third party warehouse customers as well as the impact of the elimination of intercompany sales between our operating groups. Net sales in Fiscal 2015 included the unfavorable impact of the elimination of intercompany sales between our operating groups with no meaningful impact of intercompany sales between our operating groups in Fiscal 2016.\nGross Profit\nThe table below presents gross profit by operating group and in total for Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015 as well as the change between those two periods. Our gross profit and gross margin, which is calculated as gross profit divided by net sales, may not be directly comparable to those of our competitors, as the statement of operations classification of certain expenses may vary by company.\n\nThe increase in consolidated gross profit was primarily due to higher net sales, as discussed above, and the net favorable impact of LIFO accounting. The favorable impact of these items was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the inventory step-up charge included in Southern Tide and lower gross margins in Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer, both as discussed below. The table below presents gross margin by operating group and in total for Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015.\n\nOn a consolidated basis, gross margin decreased in Fiscal 2016, primarily as a result of lower gross margins in Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer, partially offset by the net favorable impact of LIFO accounting\nTommy Bahama:\nThe decrease in Tommy Bahama's gross margin in Fiscal 2016 was primarily due to $5 million of inventory markdowns in the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2016 for certain women's, home and other products as well as lower gross margin in both the direct to consumer and wholesale businesses. The inventory markdowns primarily resulted from a change in Tommy Bahama's approach to inventory clearance; starting in January 2017, Tommy Bahama intends to aggressively clear prior season inventory by taking initial markdowns on certain product categories in its full-price retail stores and then clearing any remaining inventory through both its outlet stores and third party off-price retailers and by operating the outlet stores with lower inventory levels and with better merchandised assortments.\nThe lower gross margins in the direct to consumer channel primarily reflects lower gross margins in outlet store and e-commerce flash clearance sales which were primarily due to our efforts to drive traffic in our outlet stores, reduce inventory levels and dispose of prior season inventory during Fiscal 2016. The higher discounting in our off-price direct to consumer channel was focused on women's, home and other products as well as footwear, which we have transitioned to a third party licensee. Full-price retail store and e-commerce gross margins were also lower primarily due to a greater proportion of sales in Fiscal 2016 occurring in connection with our loyalty award card, Flip-Side and Friends & Family marketing events, which typically have lower gross margins than sales during non-promotional periods, and the impact of Tommy Bahama discounting certain end-of-season women, home and other product in store and on-line beginning in January 2017. The decrease in gross margin in the wholesale distribution channel was primarily due to a change in sales mix with off-price sales representing a greater proportion of Tommy Bahama's wholesale sales in Fiscal 2016.\nLilly Pulitzer:\nThe decrease in gross margin for Lilly Pulitzer in Fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by the change in sales mix as e-commerce flash clearance sales represented a greater proportion of sales during Fiscal 2016 and in-store markdowns were more significant in Fiscal 2016.\nLanier Apparel:\nThe increase in gross margin for Lanier Apparel was primarily due to the net favorable impact of in-stock program allowances and inventory markdowns in Fiscal 2016 as compared to Fiscal 2015.\nSouthern Tide:\nThe gross profit of Southern Tide for Fiscal 2016 includes the gross profit of Southern Tide for the period from the date of acquisition on April 19, 2016 through January 28, 2017, which was impacted by $2.7 million of incremental cost of goods sold associated with the step-up of inventory recognized at acquisition. Therefore, we do not consider the gross profit or gross margin for this period to be indicative of expected gross profit, or gross margin, for future periods. All amounts related to the step-up of inventory were recognized during Fiscal 2016, thus gross margin for Southern Tide is expected to be higher in future periods.\nCorporate and Other:\nThe gross profit in Corporate and Other in each period primarily reflects (1) the gross profit of our Lyons, Georgia distribution center operations, (2) the impact of LIFO accounting adjustments and (3) the impact of certain consolidating adjustments, including the elimination of intercompany sales between our operating groups. The primary driver for the higher gross profit was that Fiscal 2016 was favorably impacted by a LIFO accounting credit of $5.9 million with no significant impact from LIFO accounting in Fiscal 2015. The LIFO accounting credit in Fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the LIFO accounting reversal of the significant inventory markdowns recognized in Tommy Bahama during Fiscal 2016.\nSG&A\n\nThe increase in SG&A was primarily due to (1) $16.9 million of incremental costs in Fiscal 2016 associated with additional Tommy Bahama full-price retail stores and restaurants and Lilly Pulitzer full-price retail stores, (2) $11.4 million of SG&A associated with Southern Tide, including amortization of intangible assets and distribution center integration costs, (3) an increase in brand advertising, marketing and other expenses in Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer to increase brand awareness and provide support for the brands, (4) increased depreciation expense of $2.2 million related to e-commerce operations and inventory/order management systems in Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer that were implemented in the First Quarter of Fiscal 2016, (5) asset impairment charges of $1.9 million primarily related to three outlet store closings and certain information technology assets, (6) an increase in severance expenses of $1.5 million and (6) $0.8 million of transaction expenses associated with the Southern Tide acquisition, which are included in Corporate and Other. These SG&A increases were partially offset by $8.0 million of lower incentive compensation, with decreases in each operating group as well as Corporate and Other.\nSG&A included amortization of intangible assets of $2.2 million in Fiscal 2016 and $2.0 million in Fiscal 2015 with the increase primarily due to amortization related to the Southern Tide intangible assets. We anticipate that amortization of intangible assets for Fiscal 2017 will be approximately $2.2 million.\nRoyalties and other operating income\n\nRoyalties and other operating income in Fiscal 2016 primarily reflects income received from third parties from the licensing of our Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide brands. The decrease in royalty income for Fiscal 2016 reflects a decrease in royalty income from Lilly Pulitzer which was partially offset by an increase in royalty income from Tommy Bahama and the royalty income associated with the Southern Tide business.\nOperating income (loss)\n\nThe decrease in operating income in Fiscal 2016 as compared to Fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the lower operating income in Tommy Bahama, including $7.1 million of inventory markdown, severance and store closing charges incurred in the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2016, and Lanier Apparel and the operating loss in Southern Tide. These items were partially offset by higher income in Lilly Pulitzer and improved operating results in Corporate and Other. Changes in operating income (loss) by operating group are discussed below.\nTommy Bahama:\n\nThe lower operating results for Tommy Bahama were primarily due to the lower gross margin, as discussed above, and higher SG&A in Fiscal 2016. The higher SG&A for Fiscal 2016 includes (1) $11.8 million of incremental SG&A associated with operating additional full-price retail stores and restaurants, (2) an increase in brand advertising, marketing and other expenses in Tommy Bahama to increase brand awareness and provide support for the brand, (3) $1.3 million of increased severance costs, (4) increased depreciation expense of $1.9 million related to e-commerce operations, which were primarily related to website upgrades implemented in the First Quarter of Fiscal 2016, and the Tommy Bahama office in Seattle, Washington, and (5) asset impairment charges of $0.9 million primarily related to outlet store closures. These SG&A increases were partially offset by $0.7 million of lower incentive compensation. Included in the gross margin impact and SG&A items above, we incurred charges of $7.1 million in the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2016 consisting of $4.7 million of inventory markdowns, $0.9 million of severance charges and $1.6 million of charges related to outlet store closings which are anticipated to improve future operating results.\nLilly Pulitzer:\n\nThe increase in operating income in Lilly Pulitzer was primarily due to the higher net sales partially offset by the impact of the lower gross margin and higher SG&A. SG&A increased primarily due to (1) $5.2 million of incremental SG&A associated with operating additional Lilly Pulitzer full-price retail stores, (2) an increase in brand advertising, marketing and other expenses in Lilly Pulitzer to increase brand awareness and provide support for the brand, (3) increased depreciation expense of $1.1 million related to inventory/order management system upgrades implemented in the First Quarter of Fiscal 2016, and (4) other increases in SG&A, including additional employee headcount to support the growing business. These increases in SG&A were partially offset by a $5.4 million reduction in incentive compensation during Fiscal 2016, primarily resulting from the retirement of the former co-chief executive officers from the business in the First Quarter of Fiscal 2016.\nLanier Apparel:\n\nThe decrease in operating income for Lanier Apparel was primarily due to lower sales partially offset by improved gross margin and lower SG&A, resulting from lower incentive compensation.\nSouthern Tide:\n\nThe net sales, gross margin and operating loss of Southern Tide reflect the results of Southern Tide for the period from the date of acquisition on April 19, 2016 through January 28, 2017. We do not consider the results for this period to be indicative of expected results on an annual basis or for future periods. During Fiscal 2016, the operating results of Southern Tide were impacted by the $2.7 million of incremental cost of goods sold related to the step-up of inventory at acquisition, recognized in cost of goods sold as the acquired inventory was sold, $0.3 million of amortization of intangible assets and the $0.5 million of distribution center integration charges recognized during the Second Quarter of Fiscal 2016.\nCorporate and Other:\n\nThe improved operating results in Corporate and Other were primarily due to the net favorable impact of LIFO accounting of $6.1 million and $0.9 million of lower incentive compensation amounts in Fiscal 2016. These favorable items were partially offset by the impact of $0.8 million of transaction expenses associated with the Southern Tide acquisition in the First Quarter of Fiscal 2016 and the prior year including a $0.9 million gain on the sale of real estate.\nInterest expense, net\n\nInterest expense for Fiscal 2016 increased from the prior year primarily due to higher average borrowings outstanding during the year and the write off of approximately $0.3 million of deferred financing costs associated with our amendment and restatement of our revolving credit agreement. We anticipate that we will incur approximately $4 million of interest expense in Fiscal 2017 due to higher expected interest rates.\nIncome taxes\n\nIncome tax expense for Fiscal 2016 decreased, reflecting lower earnings and a lower effective tax rate. The lower effective tax rate in Fiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015 was primarily due to (1) improved operating results in our Hong Kong-based sourcing operations and Tommy Bahama Asia-Pacific retail operations resulting in the utilization of certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards, (2) the reversal of valuation allowances in certain foreign jurisdictions based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances related to our ability to realize those net operating loss carryforwards in future periods, (3) lower domestic earnings and (4) certain favorable discrete items, including the tax benefit associated with the vesting of certain restricted stock awards. Our effective tax rate for Fiscal 2017 is expected to be approximately 39%, reflecting an expected unfavorable impact on tax expense of stock awards with a grant date fair value of $78 per share that vest in April 2017 and the absence of operating loss carryforwards we may utilize in Fiscal 2017.\nNet earnings from continuing operations\n\nThe primary reasons for the lower earnings from continuing operations per diluted share in Fiscal 2016 were the lower operating income in Tommy Bahama and increased interest expense partially offset by higher income in Lilly Pulitzer, improved operating results in Corporate and Other and a lower effective tax rate.\nDiscontinued operations\n\nThe loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes in Fiscal 2016 primarily reflects an additional loss related to the retained lease obligations of our discontinued operations primarily as a result of the default and failure to pay by a sub-tenant and an updated assessment of the anticipated losses considering anticipated sub-lease income to be earned, timing of obtaining a tenant, lease incentives and market rents. Fiscal 2015 reflects the loss on the sale of our former Ben Sherman business, which was sold in the Second Quarter of Fiscal 2015, as well as the operations of the discontinued operations prior to disposal and any charges related to the discontinued operations subsequent to disposal. We do not anticipate significant operations or earnings related to the discontinued operations in future periods, with cash flow attributable to discontinued operations in the future primarily related to the amounts associated with certain retained lease obligations, which are estimated at $5.4 million as of January 28, 2017. The estimated lease liability represents our best estimate of the future net loss anticipated with respect to the\nretained lease obligations; however, the ultimate loss remains uncertain as the amount of any sub-lease income is dependent upon negotiated terms of any sub-lease agreements entered into for the space and the ability of those sub-tenants to pay the sub-lease income or alternatively, dependent upon lease termination costs negotiated with the landlords in the future.\nFISCAL 2015 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2014\nThe discussion and tables below compare certain line items included in our statements of operations for Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014. Each dollar and percentage change provided reflects the change between these periods unless indicated otherwise. Each dollar and share amount included in the tables is in thousands except for per share amounts. Individual line items of our consolidated statements of operations may not be directly comparable to those of our competitors, as classification of certain expenses may vary by company.\nNet Sales\n\nConsolidated net sales increased $49.0 million, or 5.3%, in Fiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014 reflecting changes in net sales of each operating group, as discussed below. The 5.3% increase in consolidated net sales was primarily driven by (1) a $28.8 million, or 7%, increase in comparable store sales to $418.3 million in Fiscal 2015 from $389.5 million in Fiscal 2014, (2) an incremental net sales increase of $28.4 million associated with the operation of additional full-price retail stores, (3) a $5.4 million increase in restaurant sales resulting from the operation of additional restaurants and increased sales at existing restaurants, (4) a $5.2 million net increase in outlet store, e-commerce flash clearance and warehouse sales. These increases in net sales were partially offset by an $18.9 million decrease in wholesale sales including the $21.3 million decrease in Lanier Apparel. The following table presents the proportion of our consolidated net sales by distribution channel for each period presented:\n\nTommy Bahama:\nThe Tommy Bahama net sales increase of $31.0 million, or 4.9%, was primarily driven by (1) an incremental net sales increase of $18.0 million associated with the operation of additional full-price retail stores, (2) a $7.8 million, or 3%, increase in comparable store sales to $317.8 million in Fiscal 2015 from $310.0 million in Fiscal 2014, (3) a $5.4 million increase in restaurant sales resulting from the operation of two restaurants opened in Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2015 as well as increased sales in existing restaurants and (4) a $2.1 million increase in outlet store and flash clearance sales, including the impact of new outlets opened in Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2015. These increases in net sales were partially offset by a $2.9 million decrease in wholesale sales.\nAs of January 30, 2016, we operated 164 Tommy Bahama stores globally, consisting of 107 full-price retail stores, 16 retail-restaurant locations and 41 outlet stores. As of January 31, 2015 we operated 157 Tommy Bahama stores globally consisting of 101 full-price retail stores, 15 retail-restaurant locations and 41 outlet stores. The following table presents the proportion of net sales by distribution channel for Tommy Bahama for each period presented:\n\nLilly Pulitzer:\nThe Lilly Pulitzer net sales increase of $36.9 million, or 22.0%, was primarily a result of (1) a $21.1 million, or 27%, increase in comparable store sales to $100.5 million in Fiscal 2015 compared to $79.5 million in Fiscal 2014, (2) an incremental net sales increase of $10.4 million associated with the operation of additional full-price retail stores, (3) a $2.9 million increase in wholesale sales, (4) an increase in e-commerce flash clearance sales of $1.7 million to $18.4 million in Fiscal 2015, and (5) $0.9 million higher sales at the June warehouse sale. As of January 30, 2016, we operated 34 Lilly Pulitzer full-price retail stores compared to 28 full-price retail stores as of January 31, 2015. The following table presents the proportion of net sales by distribution channel for Lilly Pulitzer for each period presented:\n\nLanier Apparel:\nThe decrease in net sales for Lanier Apparel of $21.3 million, or 16.9%, reflects a decrease in net sales in the private label and branded businesses for both tailored clothing and sportswear. The branded and private label businesses were unfavorably impacted by the reduction in or exit from certain replenishment and other programs.\nCorporate and Other:\nCorporate and Other net sales primarily consist of the net sales of our Lyons, Georgia distribution center as well as the impact of the elimination of intercompany sales between our operating groups, which exceeded net sales of our Lyons, Georgia distribution center in Fiscal 2014. The increase in Corporate and Other sales was primarily due to a smaller unfavorable impact of the elimination of intercompany sales in Fiscal 2015.\nGross Profit\nThe table below presents gross profit by operating group and in total for Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014 as well as the change between those two periods. Our gross profit and gross margin, which is calculated as gross profit divided by net sales, may not be directly comparable to those of our competitors, as statement of operations classification of certain expenses may vary by company.\n\nThe increase in consolidated gross profit was primarily driven by higher net sales, as discussed above, as well as a change in sales mix as a greater proportion of consolidated net sales were sales at Lilly Pulitzer, which typically has higher gross margins than our other operating groups, and the net favorable impact of LIFO accounting in Fiscal 2015 as compared to\nFiscal 2014. In addition to the impact of the changes in net sales, gross profit on a consolidated basis and for each operating group was impacted by the change in sales mix and gross margin within each operating group, as discussed below. The table below presents gross margin by operating group and in total for Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014.\n\nOn a consolidated basis, gross margin increased in Fiscal 2015, primarily as a result of (1) Lilly Pulitzer representing a greater proportion and Lanier Apparel representing a lower proportion of consolidated net sales, (2) direct to consumer sales, which typically provide a higher gross margin, representing a greater proportion of consolidated net sales, (3) improved gross margins in Lilly Pulitzer and Lanier Apparel and (4) the net favorable impact of LIFO accounting in Fiscal 2015 as compared to Fiscal 2014. These favorable items were partially offset by the lower gross margin in Tommy Bahama.\nTommy Bahama:\nThe reduction in gross margin for Tommy Bahama reflected lower gross margins in both the direct to consumer and wholesale channels of distribution, which offset the favorable impact of a change in sales mix with direct to consumer sales representing a greater proportion of net sales. The lower direct to consumer gross margin was primarily due to a greater proportion of sales in our full-price retail stores and e-commerce website occurring in connection with Tommy Bahama's loyalty award card, Flip-Side and Friends & Family events and more significant in-store discounts in our outlet stores. The lower gross margin in the wholesale business was primarily a result of more significant discounts and allowances, particularly for wholesale off-price sales.\nLilly Pulitzer:\nThe increase in gross margin for Lilly Pulitzer was primarily driven by a change in sales mix towards the direct to consumer channel of distribution and an increase in gross margins of the direct to consumer businesses.\nLanier Apparel:\nThe increase in gross margin for Lanier Apparel was primarily due to a change in sales mix with a greater proportion of sales consisting of higher gross margin branded business programs, in both the tailored clothing and sportswear businesses, which was partially offset by the impact of more significant inventory markdowns in Fiscal 2015.\nCorporate and Other:\nThe gross profit in Corporate and Other in each period primarily reflects (1) the gross profit of our Lyons, Georgia distribution center operations, (2) the impact of LIFO accounting adjustments and (3) the impact of certain consolidating adjustments, including the elimination of intercompany sales between our operating groups. The higher gross profit for Corporate and Other was due to the lower impact of LIFO accounting in Fiscal 2015.\nSG&A\n\nThe increase in SG&A was primarily due to (1) $19.9 million of incremental costs in Fiscal 2015 associated with additional Tommy Bahama full-price retail stores and restaurants, including the Waikiki retail-restaurant location, and Lilly Pulitzer stores, (2) costs to support the growing Lilly Pulitzer and Tommy Bahama businesses, (3) $2.7 million of increased occupancy costs associated with duplicate rent expense, moving costs and higher rent structure related to the relocation of Tommy Bahama's office in Seattle, Washington and (4) $1.1 million of additional equity compensation expense. SG&A included $1.9 million of amortization of intangible assets in Fiscal 2015 compared to $2.3 million in Fiscal 2014.\nRoyalties and other operating income\n\nRoyalties and other operating income primarily reflect income received from third parties from the licensing of our Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer brands. The $0.5 million increase in royalties and other income reflects increased royalty income for both Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer.\nOperating income (loss)\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our operations, cash flows, liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements contained in this report.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a global apparel company that designs, sources, markets and distributes products bearing the trademarks of our Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide lifestyle brands, other owned brands and licensed brands as well as private label apparel products. During Fiscal 2016, 92% of our net sales were from products bearing brands that we own and 66% of our net sales were through our direct to consumer channels of distribution. In Fiscal 2015, 96% of our consolidated net sales were to customers located in the United States, with the sales outside the United States consisting primarily of our Tommy Bahama products in Canada and the Asia-Pacific region.\nOur business strategy is to develop and market compelling lifestyle brands and products that evoke a strong emotional response from our target consumers. We consider lifestyle brands to be those brands that have a clearly defined and targeted point of view inspired by an appealing lifestyle or attitude. Furthermore, we believe lifestyle brands like Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide that create an emotional connection with consumers can command greater loyalty and higher price points at retail and create licensing opportunities, which may drive higher earnings. We believe the attraction of a lifestyle brand depends on creating compelling product, effectively communicating the respective lifestyle brand message and distributing products to consumers where and when they want it.\nOur ability to compete successfully in styling and marketing is directly related to our proficiency in foreseeing changes and trends in fashion and consumer preference, and presenting appealing products for consumers. Our design-led, commercially informed lifestyle brand operations strive to provide exciting, differentiated products each season.\nTo further strengthen each lifestyle brand's connections with consumers, we directly communicate with consumers through electronic and print media on a regular basis. We believe our ability to effectively communicate the images, lifestyle and products of our brands and create an emotional connection with consumers is critical to the success of the brands. Our advertising for our brands often attempts to convey the lifestyle of the brand as well as a specific product.\nWe distribute our owned lifestyle branded products primarily through our direct to consumer channels, consisting of our Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer retail stores and our e-commerce sites for Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide, and through our wholesale distribution channels. Our direct to consumer operations provide us with the opportunity to interact directly with our customers, present to them a broad assortment of our current season products and immerse them in the theme of the lifestyle brand. We believe that presenting our products in a setting specifically designed to showcase the lifestyle on which the brands are based enhances the image of our brands. Our Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer full-price retail stores provide high visibility for our brands and products, and allow us to stay close to the preferences of our consumers, while also providing a platform for long-term growth for the brands. In Tommy Bahama, we also operate a limited number of restaurants, generally adjacent to a Tommy Bahama full-price retail store location, which we believe further enhance the brand's image with consumers.\nAdditionally, our e-commerce websites, which represented 18% of our consolidated net sales in Fiscal 2016, provide the opportunity to increase revenues by reaching a larger population of consumers and at the same time allow our brands to provide a broader range of products. Our e-commerce flash clearance sales on our websites and our Tommy Bahama outlet stores play an important role in overall brand and inventory management by allowing us to sell discontinued and out-of-season products in brand appropriate settings and often at better prices than are typically available from third party off-price retailers.\nThe wholesale operations of our lifestyle brands complement our direct to consumer operations and provide access to a larger group of consumers. As we seek to maintain the integrity of our lifestyle brands by limiting promotional activity in our full-price retail stores and e-commerce websites, we generally target wholesale customers that follow this same approach in their stores. Our wholesale customers for our Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide brands include better department stores and specialty stores, including Signature Stores for Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide.\nWithin our Lanier Apparel operating group, we sell tailored clothing and sportswear products under licensed brands, private labels and owned brands. Lanier Apparel's customers include department stores, discount and off-price retailers, warehouse clubs, national chains, specialty retailers and others throughout the United States.\nAll of our operating groups operate in highly competitive apparel markets in which numerous U.S.-based and foreign apparel firms compete. No single apparel firm or small group of apparel firms dominates the apparel industry, and our direct competitors vary by operating group and distribution channel. We believe the principal competitive factors in the apparel industry are reputation, value, and image of brand names; design; consumer preference; price; quality; marketing; product fulfillment capabilities; and customer service.\nThe apparel industry is cyclical and very dependent upon the overall level and focus of discretionary consumer spending, which changes as regional, domestic and international economic conditions change. Often, negative economic conditions have a longer and more severe impact on the apparel industry than on other industries. We believe current global\neconomic conditions and the resulting economic uncertainty continue to impact our business, and the apparel industry as a whole.\nWe believe the retail apparel market is evolving very rapidly and in ways that are having a disruptive impact on traditional fashion retailing. The application of technology, including the internet and mobile devices, to fashion retail provides consumers increasing access to multiple, responsive distribution platforms and an unprecedented ability to communicate directly with brands, retailers and others. As a result, consumers have more information and broader, faster and cheaper access to goods than they have ever had before. This, along with the coming of age of the millennial\u201d generation, is revolutionizing the way that consumers shop for fashion and other goods. The evidence is increasingly apparent with marked weakness in department stores and mall-based retailers, decreased consumer retail traffic, a more promotional retail environment, expansion of off-price and discount retailers, and growing internet purchases.\nWhile this evolution in the fashion retail industry presents significant risks, especially for traditional retailers who fail or are unable to adapt, we believe it also presents a tremendous opportunity for brands and retailers. We believe our brands have attributes that are true competitive advantages in this new retailing paradigm and we are leveraging technology to serve our consumers when and where they want to be served. We continue to believe that our lifestyle brands are well suited to succeed and thrive in the long term while managing the various challenges facing our industry.\nSpecifically, we believe our lifestyle brands have opportunities for long-term growth in their direct to consumer businesses. We anticipate increased sales in our e-commerce operations, which are expected to grow at a faster rate than bricks and mortar comparable full-price retail store sales. This growth can also be achieved through prudent expansion of bricks and mortar full-price retail store operations and modest comparable full-price retail store sales increases. Despite the changes in the retail environment, we expect there will continue to be desirable locations to increase our store count.\nOur lifestyle brands also have an opportunity for modest sales increases in their wholesale businesses in the long term primarily from current customers adding to their existing door count and increasing their on-line business, increased sales to on-line retailers and the selective addition of new wholesale customers who generally follow a retail model with limited discounting; however, we must be diligent in our effort to avoid compromising the integrity of the brand by maintaining or growing sales with wholesale customers that may not be aligned with our long-term strategy. This is particularly important with the challenges in the department store channel, which represents about one-half of our consolidated wholesale sales, or 16% of our consolidated net sales. We also believe that there are opportunities for modest sales growth for Lanier Apparel in the future through new product programs for existing and new customers.\nWe believe we must continue to invest in our lifestyle brands to take advantage of their long-term growth opportunities. Investments include capital expenditures primarily related to the direct to consumer operations such as technology enhancements, e-commerce initiatives, full-price retail store and restaurant build-out for new and relocated locations as well as remodels, and distribution center and administrative office expansion initiatives. Additionally, while we anticipate increased employment, advertising and other costs in key functions to support the ongoing business operations and fuel future sales growth, we remain focused on appropriately managing our operating expenses.\nIn the midst of the challenges in our industry, an important focus for us in Fiscal 2017 is advancing various initiatives to increase the profitability of the Tommy Bahama business. These initiatives generally focus on increasing gross margin and operating margin through efforts such as: product cost reductions; selective price increases; reducing inventory purchases; more rapidly clearing excess inventory; redefining our approach to inventory clearance; effectively managing controllable and discretionary operating expenses; taking a more conservative approach to full-price retail store and outlet openings and renewals; and continuing our efforts to reduce Asia-Pacific operating losses.\nWe continue to believe it is important to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity. We believe positive cash flow from operations in the future coupled with the strength of our balance sheet and liquidity will provide us with sufficient resources to fund future investments in our owned lifestyle brands. While we believe we have significant opportunities to appropriately deploy our capital and resources in our existing lifestyle brands, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to add additional lifestyle brands to our portfolio if we identify appropriate targets which meet our investment criteria.\nImportant factors relating to certain risks, many of which are beyond our ability to control or predict, which could impact our business are described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report.\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated operating results from continuing operations (in thousands, except per share amounts) for Fiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015: Table 38: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,022,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>969,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earnings from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earnings from continuing operations per diluted share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe primary reasons for the lower earnings from continuing operations per diluted share in Fiscal 2016 were the lower operating income in Tommy Bahama and increased interest expense partially offset by higher income in Lilly Pulitzer, improved operating results in Corporate and Other and a lower effective tax rate.\nSouthern Tide Acquisition\nOn April 19, 2016, we acquired Southern Tide, LLC, which owns the Southern Tide lifestyle apparel brand. Southern Tide carries an extensive selection of men's shirts, pants, shorts, outerwear, ties, swimwear, footwear and accessories, as well as a women's collection. The brand's products are sold through its wholesale operations to specialty stores, department stores and Southern Tide Signature Stores as well as through its direct to consumer operations on the Southern Tide website. The purchase price for the acquisition was $85 million in cash, subject to adjustment based on net working capital as of the closing date for the acquisition. We used borrowings under our revolving credit facility to finance the transaction. For additional information about the Southern Tide acquisition, refer to Part I, Item 1. Business and Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, both included in this report.\nOPERATING GROUPS\nOur business is primarily operated through our Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer, Lanier Apparel and Southern Tide operating groups. We identify our operating groups based on the way our management organizes the components of our business for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. Our operating group structure reflects a brand-focused management approach, emphasizing operational coordination and resource allocation across each brand's direct to consumer, wholesale and licensing operations, as applicable.\nTommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide each design, source, market and distribute apparel and related products bearing their respective trademarks and also license their trademarks for other product categories, while Lanier Apparel designs, sources and distributes branded and private label men's tailored clothing, sportswear and other products. Corporate and Other is a reconciling category for reporting purposes and includes our corporate offices, substantially all financing activities, elimination of inter-segment sales, LIFO inventory accounting adjustments, other costs that are not allocated to the operating groups and operations of our other businesses which are not included in our operating groups, including our Lyons, Georgia distribution center operations. Our LIFO inventory pool does not correspond to our operating group definitions; therefore, LIFO inventory accounting adjustments are not allocated to our operating groups.\nFor additional information about each of our operating groups, see Part I, Item 1. Business and Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, both included in this report.\nCOMPARABLE STORE SALES\nWe often disclose comparable store sales in order to provide additional information regarding changes in our results of operations between periods. Our disclosures of comparable store sales include net sales from full-price retail stores and our e-commerce sites, excluding sales associated with e-commerce flash clearance sales. We believe that the inclusion of both our full-price retail stores and e-commerce sites in the comparable store sales disclosures is a more meaningful way of reporting our comparable store sales results, given similar inventory planning, allocation and return policies, as well as our cross-channel marketing and other initiatives for the direct to consumer channel. For our comparable store sales disclosures, we exclude (1) outlet store sales, warehouse sales and e-commerce flash clearance sales, as those clearance sales are used primarily to liquidate end of season inventory, which may vary significantly depending on the level of end of season inventory on hand and generally occur at lower gross margins than our non-clearance direct to consumer sales, and (2) restaurant sales, as we do not currently believe that the inclusion of restaurant sales is meaningful in assessing our consolidated results of operations. Comparable store sales information reflects net sales, including shipping and handling revenues, if any, associated with product sales.\nFor purposes of our disclosures, we consider a comparable store to be, in addition to our e-commerce sites, a physical full-price retail store that was owned and open as of the beginning of the prior fiscal year and which did not have during the relevant periods, and is not within the current fiscal year scheduled to have, (1) a remodel resulting in the store being closed for an extended period of time (which we define as a period of two weeks or longer), (2) a greater than 15% change in the size of the retail space due to expansion, reduction or relocation to a new retail space, (3) a relocation to a new space that was significantly different from the prior retail space, or (4) a closing or opening of a Tommy Bahama restaurant adjacent to the full-price retail store. For those stores which are excluded from comparable stores based on the preceding sentence, the stores continue to be excluded from comparable store sales until the criteria for a new store is met subsequent to the remodel, relocation or restaurant closing or opening. A store that is remodeled generally will continue to be included in our comparable store sales metrics as a store is not typically closed for a two week period during a remodel; however, in some cases a store may be closed for more than two weeks during a remodel. A store that is relocated generally will not be included in our comparable store sales metrics until that store has been open in the relocated space for the entirety of the prior fiscal year as the size or other characteristics of the store typically change significantly from the prior location. Additionally, any stores that were closed during the prior fiscal year or current fiscal year, or which we plan to close or vacate in the current fiscal year, are excluded from the definition of comparable store sales.\nDefinitions and calculations of comparable store sales differ among retail companies, and therefore comparable store sales metrics disclosed by us may not be comparable to the metrics disclosed by other companies.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth the specified line items in our consolidated statements of operations both in dollars (in thousands) and as a percentage of net sales.

The increase in consolidated net sales was primarily driven by (1) the $27.4 million of net sales of Southern Tide, which was acquired on April 19, 2016, (2) an incremental net sales increase of $20.2 million associated with the operation of additional full-price retail stores in Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer, (3) a $7.0 million net increase in direct to consumer clearance sales reflecting an increase in e-commerce flash clearance sales at Lilly Pulitzer and decreases in outlet store sales at Tommy Bahama and (4) a $5.4 million increase in restaurant sales in Tommy Bahama. These sales increases were partially offset by a $6.5 million, or 2%, decrease in comparable store sales to $404.1 million in Fiscal 2016 from $410.6 million in Fiscal 2015 reflecting a decrease in comparable store sales at Tommy Bahama of 3% and an increase in comparable store sales at Lilly Pulitzer of 2%. We believe that certain macroeconomic factors, including lower retail store traffic, the evolving impact of digital technology on consumer shopping habits and the 2016 election cycle, impacted the sales in each of our direct to consumer and wholesale businesses in Fiscal 2016. The changes in net sales by operating group are discussed below.\nThe following table presents the proportion of our consolidated net sales by distribution channel for each period presented:\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full-price retail stores and outlets\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>E-commerce\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restaurant\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTommy Bahama:\nThe Tommy Bahama net sales increase of $0.4 million, or 0.1%, was primarily driven by (1) an incremental net sales increase of $12.4 million associated with the operation of additional full-price retail stores and (2) a $5.4 million increase in restaurant sales primarily resulting from the impact of a full year of operations of the Waikiki restaurant in Fiscal 2016 and a modest increase at restaurants open for the full year of Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015. These sales increases were offset by (1) a $8.8 million, or 3%, decrease in comparable store sales to $302.5 million in Fiscal 2016 from $311.3 million in Fiscal 2015, (2) a $3.6 million decrease in net sales through our off-price direct to consumer clearance channels, primarily reflecting a decrease in sales in existing outlet stores, and (3) a $5.2 million decrease in wholesale sales. The decreases in the direct to consumer channels were primarily due to lower traffic in both our full-price retail stores and outlet stores. The decrease in wholesale sales reflects lower full-price wholesale sales reflecting the challenging environment of our wholesale department store and specialty store accounts.\nAs of January 28, 2017, we operated 168 Tommy Bahama stores globally, consisting of 111 full-price retail stores, 17 retail-restaurant locations and 40 outlet stores. As of January 30, 2016, we operated 164 Tommy Bahama stores consisting of 107 full-price retail stores, 16 retail-restaurant locations and 41 outlet stores.

These sales increases were partially offset by a net $3.8 million decrease in warehouse sales as Lilly Pulitzer did not anniversary its June warehouse sale in 2016. As of January 28, 2017, we operated 40 Lilly Pulitzer full-price retail stores, after opening six new stores, acquiring one former Signature Store and closing one store during Fiscal 2016, compared to 34 full-price retail stores as of January 30, 2016. The following table presents the proportion of net sales by distribution channel for Lilly Pulitzer for each period presented:\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full-price retail stores and warehouse sales\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>E-commerce\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLanier Apparel:\nThe decrease in net sales for Lanier Apparel of $4.4 million, or 4.1%, was primarily due to lower sales of $6.5 million in the tailored clothing business partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in the sportswear business. The decreased sales in the tailored clothing business was primarily due to lower sales in certain programs including reductions in volume, shifts of timing and exits from various programs. These reductions in volume were partially offset by initial shipments and volume increases in other programs. The increased sales in the sportswear business were primarily due to increased volumes in private label sportswear programs.\nSouthern Tide:\nThe net sales of Southern Tide reflect the sales of Southern Tide for the period from the date of acquisition on April 19, 2016 through January 28, 2017. During the period from April 19, 2016 through January 28, 2017, 77% of Southern Tide's net sales were wholesale sales with the remainder of the sales consisting of e-commerce sales. We estimate that net sales in Fiscal 2017 will be in excess of $40 million, with about 75% to 80% of the sales consisting of wholesale sales and the remainder consisting of e-commerce sales on the Southern Tide website.\nCorporate and Other:\nCorporate and Other net sales primarily consist of the net sales of our Lyons, Georgia distribution center to third party warehouse customers as well as the impact of the elimination of intercompany sales between our operating groups. Net sales in Fiscal 2015 included the unfavorable impact of the elimination of intercompany sales between our operating groups with no meaningful impact of intercompany sales between our operating groups in Fiscal 2016.\nGross Profit\nThe table below presents gross profit by operating group and in total for Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015 as well as the change between those two periods. Our gross profit and gross margin, which is calculated as gross profit divided by net sales, may not be directly comparable to those of our competitors, as the statement of operations classification of certain expenses may vary by company.\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2015\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tommy Bahama\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>386,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>393,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,571\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lilly Pulitzer\n</td> <td>148,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lanier Apparel\n</td> <td>29,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(970\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(3.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Southern Tide\n</td> <td>10,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and Other\n</td> <td>7,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total gross profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>582,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>558,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LIFO (credit) charge included in Corporate and Other\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,884\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventory step-up charge included in Southern Tide\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in consolidated gross profit was primarily due to higher net sales, as discussed above, and the net favorable impact of LIFO accounting. The favorable impact of these items was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the inventory step-up charge included in Southern Tide and lower gross margins in Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer, both as discussed below. The table below presents gross margin by operating group and in total for Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015.\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tommy Bahama\n</td> <td>58.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>59.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lilly Pulitzer\n</td> <td>63.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>64.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lanier Apparel\n</td> <td>29.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>29.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Southern Tide\n</td> <td>39.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and Other\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated gross margin\n</td> <td>57.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>57.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn a consolidated basis, gross margin decreased in Fiscal 2016, primarily as a result of lower gross margins in Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer, partially offset by the net favorable impact of LIFO accounting\nTommy Bahama:\nThe decrease in Tommy Bahama's gross margin in Fiscal 2016 was primarily due to $5 million of inventory markdowns in the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2016 for certain women's, home and other products as well as lower gross margin in both the direct to consumer and wholesale businesses. The inventory markdowns primarily resulted from a change in Tommy Bahama's approach to inventory clearance; starting in January 2017, Tommy Bahama intends to aggressively clear prior season inventory by taking initial markdowns on certain product categories in its full-price retail stores and then clearing any remaining inventory through both its outlet stores and third party off-price retailers and by operating the outlet stores with lower inventory levels and with better merchandised assortments.\nThe lower gross margins in the direct to consumer channel primarily reflects lower gross margins in outlet store and e-commerce flash clearance sales which were primarily due to our efforts to drive traffic in our outlet stores, reduce inventory levels and dispose of prior season inventory during Fiscal 2016. The higher discounting in our off-price direct to consumer channel was focused on women's, home and other products as well as footwear, which we have transitioned to a third party licensee. Full-price retail store and e-commerce gross margins were also lower primarily due to a greater proportion of sales in Fiscal 2016 occurring in connection with our loyalty award card, Flip-Side and Friends & Family marketing events, which typically have lower gross margins than sales during non-promotional periods, and the impact of Tommy Bahama discounting certain end-of-season women, home and other product in store and on-line beginning in January 2017. The decrease in gross margin in the wholesale distribution channel was primarily due to a change in sales mix with off-price sales representing a greater proportion of Tommy Bahama's wholesale sales in Fiscal 2016.\nLilly Pulitzer:\nThe decrease in gross margin for Lilly Pulitzer in Fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by the change in sales mix as e-commerce flash clearance sales represented a greater proportion of sales during Fiscal 2016 and in-store markdowns were more significant in Fiscal 2016.\nLanier Apparel:\nThe increase in gross margin for Lanier Apparel was primarily due to the net favorable impact of in-stock program allowances and inventory markdowns in Fiscal 2016 as compared to Fiscal 2015.\nSouthern Tide:\nThe gross profit of Southern Tide for Fiscal 2016 includes the gross profit of Southern Tide for the period from the date of acquisition on April 19, 2016 through January 28, 2017, which was impacted by $2.7 million of incremental cost of goods sold associated with the step-up of inventory recognized at acquisition. Therefore, we do not consider the gross profit or gross margin for this period to be indicative of expected gross profit, or gross margin, for future periods. All amounts related to the step-up of inventory were recognized during Fiscal 2016, thus gross margin for Southern Tide is expected to be higher in future periods.\nCorporate and Other:\nThe gross profit in Corporate and Other in each period primarily reflects (1) the gross profit of our Lyons, Georgia distribution center operations, (2) the impact of LIFO accounting adjustments and (3) the impact of certain consolidating adjustments, including the elimination of intercompany sales between our operating groups. The primary driver for the higher gross profit was that Fiscal 2016 was favorably impacted by a LIFO accounting credit of $5.9 million with no significant impact from LIFO accounting in Fiscal 2015. The LIFO accounting credit in Fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the LIFO accounting reversal of the significant inventory markdowns recognized in Tommy Bahama during Fiscal 2016.\nSG&A\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2015\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>507,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>475,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A (as a % of net sales)\n</td> <td>49.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>49.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets included in Tommy Bahama associated with Tommy Bahama Canada acquisition\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets included in Southern Tide\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction expenses associated with the Southern Tide acquisition included in Corporate and Other\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>762\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution center integration charges\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>454\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in SG&A was primarily due to (1) $16.9 million of incremental costs in Fiscal 2016 associated with additional Tommy Bahama full-price retail stores and restaurants and Lilly Pulitzer full-price retail stores, (2) $11.4 million of SG&A associated with Southern Tide, including amortization of intangible assets and distribution center integration costs, (3) an increase in brand advertising, marketing and other expenses in Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer to increase brand awareness and provide support for the brands, (4) increased depreciation expense of $2.2 million related to e-commerce operations and inventory/order management systems in Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer that were implemented in the First Quarter of Fiscal 2016, (5) asset impairment charges of $1.9 million primarily related to three outlet store closings and certain information technology assets, (6) an increase in severance expenses of $1.5 million and (6) $0.8 million of transaction expenses associated with the Southern Tide acquisition, which are included in Corporate and Other.

Our effective tax rate for Fiscal 2017 is expected to be approximately 39%, reflecting an expected unfavorable impact on tax expense of stock awards with a grant date fair value of $78 per share that vest in April 2017 and the absence of operating loss carryforwards we may utilize in Fiscal 2017.\nNet earnings from continuing operations\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earnings from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earnings from continuing operations per diluted share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average shares outstanding - diluted\n</td> <td>16,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe primary reasons for the lower earnings from continuing operations per diluted share in Fiscal 2016 were the lower operating income in Tommy Bahama and increased interest expense partially offset by higher income in Lilly Pulitzer, improved operating results in Corporate and Other and a lower effective tax rate.\nDiscontinued operations\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2015\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,038\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27,975\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes in Fiscal 2016 primarily reflects an additional loss related to the retained lease obligations of our discontinued operations primarily as a result of the default and failure to pay by a sub-tenant and an updated assessment of the anticipated losses considering anticipated sub-lease income to be earned, timing of obtaining a tenant, lease incentives and market rents. Fiscal 2015 reflects the loss on the sale of our former Ben Sherman business, which was sold in the Second Quarter of Fiscal 2015, as well as the operations of the discontinued operations prior to disposal and any charges related to the discontinued operations subsequent to disposal. We do not anticipate significant operations or earnings related to the discontinued operations in future periods, with cash flow attributable to discontinued operations in the future primarily related to the amounts associated with certain retained lease obligations, which are estimated at $5.4 million as of January 28, 2017. The estimated lease liability represents our best estimate of the future net loss anticipated with respect to the\nretained lease obligations; however, the ultimate loss remains uncertain as the amount of any sub-lease income is dependent upon negotiated terms of any sub-lease agreements entered into for the space and the ability of those sub-tenants to pay the sub-lease income or alternatively, dependent upon lease termination costs negotiated with the landlords in the future.\nFISCAL 2015 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2014\nThe discussion and tables below compare certain line items included in our statements of operations for Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014.

As of January 30, 2016, we operated 34 Lilly Pulitzer full-price retail stores compared to 28 full-price retail stores as of January 31, 2015.

The branded and private label businesses were unfavorably impacted by the reduction in or exit from certain replenishment and other programs.\nCorporate and Other:\nCorporate and Other net sales primarily consist of the net sales of our Lyons, Georgia distribution center as well as the impact of the elimination of intercompany sales between our operating groups, which exceeded net sales of our Lyons, Georgia distribution center in Fiscal 2014. The increase in Corporate and Other sales was primarily due to a smaller unfavorable impact of the elimination of intercompany sales in Fiscal 2015.\nGross Profit\nThe table below presents gross profit by operating group and in total for Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014 as well as the change between those two periods. Our gross profit and gross margin, which is calculated as gross profit divided by net sales, may not be directly comparable to those of our competitors, as statement of operations classification of certain expenses may vary by company.\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2015\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2014\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tommy Bahama\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>393,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>377,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lilly Pulitzer\n</td> <td>132,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lanier Apparel\n</td> <td>30,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,699\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(10.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and Other\n</td> <td>1,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total gross profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>558,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>517,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LIFO charge included in Corporate and Other\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in consolidated gross profit was primarily driven by higher net sales, as discussed above, as well as a change in sales mix as a greater proportion of consolidated net sales were sales at Lilly Pulitzer, which typically has higher gross margins than our other operating groups, and the net favorable impact of LIFO accounting in Fiscal 2015 as compared to\nFiscal 2014. In addition to the impact of the changes in net sales, gross profit on a consolidated basis and for each operating group was impacted by the change in sales mix and gross margin within each operating group, as discussed below. The table below presents gross margin by operating group and in total for Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014.\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2015\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tommy Bahama\n</td> <td>59.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>60.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lilly Pulitzer\n</td> <td>64.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>63.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lanier Apparel\n</td> <td>29.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>27.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and Other\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated gross margin\n</td> <td>57.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>56.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn a consolidated basis, gross margin increased in Fiscal 2015, primarily as a result of (1) Lilly Pulitzer representing a greater proportion and Lanier Apparel representing a lower proportion of consolidated net sales, (2) direct to consumer sales, which typically provide a higher gross margin, representing a greater proportion of consolidated net sales, (3) improved gross margins in Lilly Pulitzer and Lanier Apparel and (4) the net favorable impact of LIFO accounting in Fiscal 2015 as compared to Fiscal 2014. These favorable items were partially offset by the lower gross margin in Tommy Bahama.\nTommy Bahama:\nThe reduction in gross margin for Tommy Bahama reflected lower gross margins in both the direct to consumer and wholesale channels of distribution, which offset the favorable impact of a change in sales mix with direct to consumer sales representing a greater proportion of net sales. The lower direct to consumer gross margin was primarily due to a greater proportion of sales in our full-price retail stores and e-commerce website occurring in connection with Tommy Bahama's loyalty award card, Flip-Side and Friends & Family events and more significant in-store discounts in our outlet stores. The lower gross margin in the wholesale business was primarily a result of more significant discounts and allowances, particularly for wholesale off-price sales.\nLilly Pulitzer:\nThe increase in gross margin for Lilly Pulitzer was primarily driven by a change in sales mix towards the direct to consumer channel of distribution and an increase in gross margins of the direct to consumer businesses.\nLanier Apparel:\nThe increase in gross margin for Lanier Apparel was primarily due to a change in sales mix with a greater proportion of sales consisting of higher gross margin branded business programs, in both the tailored clothing and sportswear businesses, which was partially offset by the impact of more significant inventory markdowns in Fiscal 2015.\nCorporate and Other:\nThe gross profit in Corporate and Other in each period primarily reflects (1) the gross profit of our Lyons, Georgia distribution center operations, (2) the impact of LIFO accounting adjustments and (3) the impact of certain consolidating adjustments, including the elimination of intercompany sales between our operating groups. The higher gross profit for Corporate and Other was due to the lower impact of LIFO accounting in Fiscal 2015.\nSG&A\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2015\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2014\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>475,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>439,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A as % of net sales\n</td> <td>49.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>47.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets included in Tommy Bahama associated with Tommy Bahama Canada acquisition\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of contingent consideration included in Lilly Pulitzer\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in SG&A was primarily due to (1) $19.9 million of incremental costs in Fiscal 2015 associated with additional Tommy Bahama full-price retail stores and restaurants, including the Waikiki retail-restaurant location, and Lilly Pulitzer stores, (2) costs to support the growing Lilly Pulitzer and Tommy Bahama businesses, (3) $2.7 million of increased occupancy costs associated with duplicate rent expense, moving costs and higher rent structure related to the relocation of Tommy Bahama's office in Seattle, Washington and (4) $1.1 million of additional equity compensation expense.
