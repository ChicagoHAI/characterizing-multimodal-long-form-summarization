Xcel Energy's operations included the activity of four utility subsidiaries that serve electric and natural gas customers in eight states. These utility subsidiaries are NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin, PSCo and SPS. These utilities serve customers in portions of Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin. Along with the TransCo subsidiaries, WYCO, a joint venture formed with CIG to develop and lease natural gas pipelines, storage and compression facilities, and WGI, an interstate natural gas pipeline company, these companies comprise the regulated utility operations.\nXcel Energy Inc.'s nonregulated subsidiaries are Eloigne and Capital Services. Eloigne invests in rental housing projects that qualify for low-income housing tax credits, and Capital Services procures equipment for construction of renewable generation facilities at other subsidiaries.\nForward-Looking Statements\nExcept for the historical statements contained in this report, the matters discussed herein are forward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions.

The following factors, in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2016 (including the items described under Factors Affecting Results of Operations; and the other risk factors listed from time to time by Xcel Energy Inc. in reports filed with the SEC, including Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Exhibit 99.01 hereto), could cause actual results to differ materially from management expectations as suggested by such forward-looking information: general economic conditions, including inflation rates, monetary fluctuations and their impact on capital expenditures and the ability of Xcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries to obtain financing on favorable terms; business conditions in the energy industry, including the risk of a slow down in the U.S. economy or delay in growth, recovery, trade, fiscal, taxation and environmental policies in areas where Xcel Energy has a financial interest; customer business conditions; actions of credit rating agencies; competitive factors including the extent and timing of the entry of additional competition in the markets served by Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries; unusual weather; effects of geopolitical events, including war and acts of terrorism; cyber security threats and data security breaches; state, federal and foreign legislative and regulatory initiatives that affect cost and investment recovery, have an impact on rates or have an impact on asset operation or ownership or impose environmental compliance conditions; structures that affect the speed and degree to which competition enters the electric and natural gas markets; costs and other effects of legal and administrative proceedings, settlements, investigations and claims; financial or regulatory accounting policies imposed by regulatory bodies; outcomes of regulatory proceedings; availability of cost of capital; and employee work force factors.\nManagement's Strategic Priorities\nXcel Energy strives to provide our investors an attractive value proposition and our customers with safe, clean and reliable energy services at a competitive price. This mission is enabled via five key strategic priorities:\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Invest in infrastructure;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Improve the customer experience;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Advance the regulatory framework and performance;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Transition the power generation fleet; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Provide a competitive total return to investors and maintain strong investment grade credit ratings.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBelow is a discussion of these objectives.\nInvest in infrastructure\nSound investments today are necessary for tomorrow's success. Our capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $18.4 billion from 2017 through 2021. This capital investment profile will grow our consolidated rate base at a compounded average annual rate of approximately 5.5 percent. Our capital plan includes investments in renewables, transmission, distribution, electric generation, natural gas and other parts of our utility business. Our plan includes approximately $1.3 billion of investment for grid modernization to improve the customer experience, enhance grid reliability and enable new and innovative programs and rate structures. In addition, we plan to invest $2.2 billion in gas infrastructure to enhance safety, reliability and operational performance for the benefit of our customers and communities.\nImprove the customer experience\nThe utility landscape is changing, and we must continue to thoughtfully anticipate and address the future needs of our stakeholders, including our customers, policymakers, employees and shareholders. Adapting to this changing environment is critical to our long-term success. Our customers expect to have choices, and we are committed to providing options and solutions that they want and value at a competitive price. Our continued investment in clean energy is an example of this commitment to our customers. Environmental stewardship remains foundational to Xcel Energy and is designed to meet customer and policy maker expectations while creating shareholder value. We will continue to offer and expand our production of renewable energy, including wind and solar alternatives, and further develop and promote DSM, conservation and renewable programs.\nAdvance the regulatory framework and performance\nXcel Energy is a holding company comprised primarily of several utility operating companies. As part of the regulatory process, each state will generally establish an authorized ROE. In many states, our utility operating companies earn less than the authorized ROE due to numerous factors including the timing of implementation of new rates, timing of capital investments, a regulatory commission not allowing the recovery of certain costs, the time period used as a test year for rate cases, fluctuations in sales, the impact of weather, unanticipated cost increases, etc. The difference between the authorized ROE and the earned ROE is referred to as an ROE gap. Xcel Energy is focused on reducing this gap.\nWe continue to pursue regulatory and legislative changes to streamline rate case proceedings and optimize recovery, while improving our alignment with state policies and keeping pace with evolving customer preferences.\nIn addition, keeping our costs competitive is also essential in terms of customer affordability and improving ROE over time. Xcel Energy is working to keep O&M expense relatively flat without compromising reliability or safety. We intend to accomplish this objective by continually improving our processes, leveraging technology, proactively managing risk and maintaining a workforce that is prepared to meet the needs of our business today and tomorrow.\nTransition the power generation fleet\nFor more than a decade, we have managed the risk of climate change through a clean energy strategy that consistently reduces carbon emissions and transitions our operations for the future. We continue to provide shareholder value while transforming how we produce, deliver and encourage the efficient use of energy through four primary mechanisms:\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Increasing the use of renewable energy;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Offering energy efficiency programs for customers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Retiring or repowering coals units and modernizing our generating plants; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Advancing power grid capabilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur service territories benefit from the geographic concentration of favorable renewable resources. Strong wind and high solar irradiance yield high generation capacity factors and consequently lowers the cost of these resources.\nThe combination of high capacity factors, a strong transmission network, improved supply chain, technological improvements and the extension of the renewable tax credits translates into low renewable energy costs for our customers. As a result, we have a beneficial opportunity to invest in renewable generation, in which the capital costs are largely or completely offset by fuel savings. This provides us the opportunity to lower the emission profile of our generation fleet, grow our renewable portfolio and provide significant fuel savings to our customers.\nOur capital forecast for 2017-2021 includes $3.5 billion of investment in renewable generation. This includes the following projects:\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The 600 MW Rush Creek wind project in Colorado, which was approved by the CPUC in 2016;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A proposal to build and own 750 MW of new wind generation at NSP-Minnesota. This project is pending MPUC approval; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Plans to spend an additional $1.5 billion on other renewable projects in our various states. This could include our preliminary plans to add 500-1,000 MW of wind generation at SPS.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEmission reductions are an important driver of our strategy. Since 2005, we have reduced carbon emissions 30 percent and are projected to achieve an approximate 43 percent reduction by 2021.\nProvide a competitive total return to investors and maintain strong investment grade credit\nSuccessful execution of our strategic objectives should allow Xcel Energy to continue to deliver a competitive total return for our shareholders. Through our disciplined approach to business growth, financial investment, operations and safety, we plan to:\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Deliver long-term annual EPS growth of four percent to six percent;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Deliver annual dividend increases of five percent to seven percent;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Target a dividend payout ratio of 60 to 70 percent of annual ongoing EPS; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Maintain senior unsecured debt credit ratings in the BBB+ to A range.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have successfully achieved our prior financial objectives, meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance range for twelve consecutive years and believe we are positioned to continue to deliver on our value proposition. Our ongoing earnings have grown approximately 6.1 percent and our dividend has grown approximately 4.3 percent annually from 2005 through 2016. In addition, our current senior unsecured debt credit ratings for Xcel Energy and its utility subsidiaries are in the BBB+ to A range.\nFinancial Review\nThe following discussion and analysis by management focuses on those factors that had a material effect on Xcel Energy's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows during the periods presented, or are expected to have a material impact in the future. It should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the related notes to consolidated financial statements.\nThe only common equity securities that are publicly traded are common shares of Xcel Energy Inc. The diluted earnings and EPS of each subsidiary as well as the ROE of each subsidiary discussed below do not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities allocated to such subsidiary but rather represent a direct interest in our assets and liabilities as a whole. Ongoing diluted EPS and ongoing ROE for Xcel Energy and by subsidiary are financial measures not recognized under GAAP. Ongoing diluted EPS is calculated by dividing the net income or loss attributable to the controlling interest of each subsidiary, adjusted for certain nonrecurring items, by the weighted average fully diluted Xcel Energy Inc. common shares outstanding for the period. Ongoing ROE is calculated by dividing the net income or loss attributable to the controlling interest of Xcel Energy or each subsidiary, adjusted for certain nonrecurring items, by each entity's average common stockholders' or stockholder's equity. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and provide details of earnings results. We believe these measurements are useful to investors to evaluate the actual and projected financial performance and contribution of our subsidiaries. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes the diluted EPS for Xcel Energy:\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NSP-Minnesota\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.96\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PSCo\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.92\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.90\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SPS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NSP-Wisconsin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regulated utility (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Xcel Energy Inc. and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ongoing diluted EPS (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.03\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on Monticello LCM/EPU project\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.16\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP diluted EPS (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.94\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.03\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Amounts may not add due to rounding.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOngoing earnings for 2015 excludes an adjustment related to the Monticello nuclear facility LCM/EPU project. See below as well as Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nXcel Energy's management believes that ongoing earnings provide a meaningful comparison of earnings results and is representative of Xcel Energy's fundamental core earnings power. Xcel Energy's management uses ongoing earnings internally for financial planning and analysis, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors, in determining whether performance targets are met for performance-based compensation and when communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors.\n2015 Adjustment to GAAP Earnings\nLoss on Monticello LCM/EPU Project - In March 2015, the MPUC approved full recovery, including a return, on $415 million of the project costs, inclusive of AFUDC, but only allowed recovery of the remaining $333 million of costs with no return on this portion of the investment for 2015 and beyond. As a result of this decision, Xcel Energy recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $129 million, or $79 million net of tax, in the first quarter of 2015. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nEarnings Adjusted for Certain Items\n2016 Comparison with 2015\nXcel Energy - 2016 GAAP earnings increased due to the 2015 loss on Monticello LCM/EPU project, see Note 12 for further information. In addition, GAAP and ongoing earnings increased $0.12 per share. Increases in electric and natural gas margins were primarily driven by higher rates and riders across various jurisdictions to recover our capital investments and the favorable impact of weather as compared with the previous year. These positive factors and a lower ETR were partially offset by higher depreciation, interest charges and property taxes.\nNSP-Minnesota - 2016 GAAP earnings increased due to the 2015 loss on Monticello LCM/EPU project, see Note 12 for further information. In addition, GAAP and ongoing earnings increased $0.11 per share due to the following: higher electric margins primarily driven by an interim electric rate increase in Minnesota (net of estimated provision for refund); non-fuel riders; the favorable impact of weather; and a lower ETR. These positive factors were partially offset by higher depreciation, O&M expenses, interest charges and property taxes\nPSCo - Earnings decreased $0.01 per share for 2016. The positive impact of higher natural gas margins (primarily due to a rate increase), sales growth and a lower estimated electric earnings test refund, were more than offset by increased depreciation and interest charges.\nSPS - Earnings increased $0.05 per share for 2016. Higher electric margins and lower O&M expenses were partially offset by an increase in depreciation and interest charges.\nNSP-Wisconsin - Earnings decreased $0.01 per share for 2016. The positive impact of higher electric margins (primarily driven by an electric rate increase) was more than offset by higher O&M expenses and depreciation.\nEquity earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries - Earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries increased $0.01 per share in 2016 due to facility expansion and increased sales at WYCO.\nXcel Energy Inc. and other - Xcel Energy Inc. and other includes financing costs at the holding company and other items.\nThe decrease in earnings was primarily related to higher long-term debt levels.\n2015 Comparison with 2014\nXcel Energy - Twelve month year-over-year GAAP earnings decreased due to the 2015 loss on Monticello LCM/EPU project, refer to Note 12 for further information. Ongoing earnings increased $0.06 per share for 2015 primarily due to rate increases in various jurisdictions, non-fuel riders, a lower earnings test refund in Colorado and a decline in O&M expenses. These positive factors were partially offset by the impact of negative weather as well as higher depreciation, property taxes, interest charges and lower AFUDC.\nNSP-Minnesota - Twelve month year-over-year GAAP earnings decreased due to the 2015 loss on Monticello LCM/EPU project, refer to Note 12 for further information. Ongoing earnings increased $0.05 per share for 2015 and were positively impacted by electric rate increases in Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota, and lower O&M expenses. These positive factors were partially offset by unfavorable weather, sales decline, higher depreciation, increased interest charges, property taxes and lower AFUDC.\nPSCo - Earnings increased $0.02 per share for 2015. Higher revenue primarily due to the CACJA rider (partially offset by an electric base rate decrease), as well as a natural gas rate increase, effective in October 2015, lower estimated electric earnings test refunds and the positive impact of weather. These positive factors were partially offset by higher property taxes, depreciation, O&M expenses, interest charges and lower AFUDC.\nSPS - Earnings decreased $0.01 per share for 2015. Although Texas electric rates rose as a result of the prior year rate case, this was reduced by the negative impact of the 2015 case. The net increase in electric rates was more than offset by additional depreciation, higher O&M expenses and lower AFUDC.\nNSP-Wisconsin - Earnings increased $0.01 per share for 2015. Higher electric revenues primarily driven by an electric rate increase and lower O&M expenses were partially offset by higher depreciation and lower natural gas margins.\nChanges in Diluted EPS\nThe following table summarizes significant components contributing to the changes in 2016 EPS compared with the same period in 2015:\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dec. 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015 GAAP diluted EPS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.94\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on Monticello LCM/EPU project\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015 ongoing diluted EPS (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of change -

Unusually hot summers or cold winters increase electric and natural gas sales, while mild weather reduces electric and natural gas sales. The estimated impact of weather on earnings is based on the number of customers, temperature variances and the amount of natural gas or electricity the average customer historically uses per degree of temperature. Accordingly, deviations in weather from normal levels can affect Xcel Energy's financial performance.\nDegree-day or Temperature-Humidity Index (THI) data is used to estimate amounts of energy required to maintain comfortable indoor temperature levels based on each day's average temperature and humidity. Heating degree-days (HDD) is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature falls below 65\u00b0 Fahrenheit. Cooling degree-days (CDD) is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature rises above 65\u00b0 Fahrenheit. Each degree of temperature above 65\u00b0 Fahrenheit is counted as one CDD, and each degree of temperature below 65\u00b0 Fahrenheit is counted as one HDD. In Xcel Energy's more humid service territories, a THI is used in place of CDD, which adds a humidity factor to CDD. HDD, CDD and THI are most likely to impact the usage of Xcel Energy's residential and commercial customers. Industrial customers are less sensitive to weather.\nNormal weather conditions are defined as either the 20-year or 30-year average of actual historical weather conditions. The historical period of time used in the calculation of normal weather differs by jurisdiction, based on regulatory practice. To calculate the impact of weather on demand, a demand factor is applied to the weather impact on sales as defined above to derive the amount of demand associated with the weather impact.\nThe percentage increase (decrease) in normal and actual HDD, CDD and THI are provided in the following table:\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs.\nNormal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs.\nNormal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014 vs.\nNormal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HDD\n</td> <td>(13.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CDD\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>THI\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWeather -

Natural gas margins decreased primarily due to warmer winter weather and lower gas recovery rates primarily in NSP-Minnesota and PSCo.\nNon-Fuel Operating Expenses and Other Items\nO&M Expenses - O&M expenses decreased $3.1 million, or 0.1 percent, for 2016 compared with 2015.\nO&M expenses decreased $4.7 million, or 0.2 percent for 2015 compared with 2014. The decline was primarily related to a reduction in nuclear expense driven by operational efficiencies and lower amortization of prior outages, which were partially offset by an increase in labor and contract labor as a result of various projects and initiatives to improve business processes.\nConservation and DSM Program Expenses - Conservation and DSM program expenses increased $20.1 million, or 8.9 percent, for 2016 compared with 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to more customer participation in DSM programs. Higher conservation and DSM program expenses are generally offset by higher revenues due to recovery mechanisms.\nConservation and DSM program expenses decreased $77.1 million, or 25.5 percent, for 2015 compared with 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower electric and gas recovery rates at NSP-Minnesota and PSCo.\nDepreciation and Amortization - Depreciation and amortization increased $178.7 million, or 15.9 percent, for 2016 compared with 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to capital investments, including Pleasant Valley and Border Wind Farms, reduction of the excess depreciation reserve in Minnesota and recognition of the DOE settlement credits in 2015.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $105.5 million, or 10.4 percent, for 2015 compared with 2014. The increase was primarily attributed to capital investments and lower amortization of the excess depreciation reserve in Minnesota, partially offset by Minnesota's amortization of the DOE settlement.\nTaxes (Other Than Income Taxes) - Taxes (other than income taxes) increased $20.4 million, or 4.0 percent, for 2016 compared with 2015. The increase was primarily due to higher property taxes in Minnesota, excluding the impact of the proposed tax deferral in the settlement agreement in the Minnesota 2016 multi-year electric rate case.\nTaxes (other than income taxes) increased $45.8 million, or 9.8 percent, for 2015 compared with 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher property taxes in Colorado, Minnesota and Texas.\nAFUDC, Equity and Debt - AFUDC increased $5.4 million for 2016 compared with 2015. The increase was primarily due to the expansion of transmission facilities and other capital expenditures.\nAFUDC decreased $46.0 million for 2015 compared with 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the implementation of the CACJA rider, facilitating earlier and alternative recovery of construction costs.\nInterest Charges - Interest charges increased $51.6 million, or 8.7 percent, for 2016 compared with 2015. The increase was related to higher long-term debt levels to fund capital investments, partially offset by refinancings at lower interest rates.\nInterest charges increased $28.7 million, or 5.1 percent, for 2015 compared with 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher long-term debt levels, partially offset by refinancings at lower interest rates.\nIncome Taxes - Income tax expense increased $38.5 million for 2016 compared with 2015. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to higher pretax earnings in 2016, partially offset by increased wind PTCs in 2016. The ETR was 34.1 percent for 2016 compared with 35.5 percent for 2015. The lower ETR in 2016 is primarily due to the wind PTCs in 2016. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nIncome tax expense increased $18.9 million for 2015 compared with 2014. The increase was primarily due to a higher tax benefit for a carryback claim in 2014 and decrease in permanent plant-related deductions (e.g., AFUDC-equity) in 2015. The ETR was 35.5 percent for 2015 compared with 33.9 percent for 2014.

Various regulatory agencies approve the prices for electric and natural gas service within their respective jurisdictions and affect Xcel Energy's ability to recover its costs from customers. The historical and future trends of Xcel Energy's operating results have been, and are expected to be, affected by a number of factors, including those listed below.\nGeneral Economic Conditions\nEconomic conditions may have a material impact on Xcel Energy's operating results. While economic growth has been improving over the past year, management cannot predict whether this trend will be sustained going forward. Other events impact overall economic conditions and management cannot predict the impact of fluctuating energy prices, terrorist activity, war or the threat of war. However, Xcel Energy could experience a material impact to its results of operations, future growth or ability to raise capital resulting from a sustained general slowdown in economic growth or a significant increase in interest rates.\nFuel Supply and Costs\nXcel Energy Inc.'s operating utilities have varying dependence on coal, natural gas and uranium. Changes in commodity prices are generally recovered through fuel recovery mechanisms and have very little impact on earnings. However, availability of supply, the potential implementation of a carbon tax or emissions-related generation restrictions and unanticipated changes in regulatory recovery mechanisms could impact our operations. See Item 1 for further discussion of fuel supply and costs.\nPension Plan Costs and Assumptions\nXcel Energy has significant net pension and postretirement benefit costs that are measured using actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates and expected return on plan assets. Xcel Energy evaluates these key assumptions at least annually by analyzing current market conditions, which include changes in interest rates and market returns. Changes in the related net pension and postretirement benefits costs and funding requirements may occur in the future due to changes in assumptions. The payout of a significant percentage of pension plan liabilities in a single year due to high retirements or employees leaving Xcel Energy would trigger settlement accounting and could require Xcel Energy to recognize material incremental pension expense related to unrecognized plan losses in the year these liabilities are paid. For further discussion and a sensitivity analysis on these assumptions, see Employee Benefits\u201d under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\nTax Reform\nTax reform is a key component of the pro-growth agenda of the new Congress and the Trump Administration. Xcel Energy believes it is early in the process and will continue to evolve. Xcel Energy has initially analyzed two potential tax-reform scenarios and their potential impact. Both scenarios assume a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 20 percent in 2018, with the first scenario maintaining interest deductibility and not including 100 percent capital expensing, and the second scenario providing for 100 percent capital expensing and no deductibility of interest expense.\nThe impact under the first scenario could be mildly accretive to Xcel Energy's earnings in 2021, due to a reduction in the deferred tax liability over time. The impact under the second scenario would be modestly dilutive to Xcel Energy's earnings in 2021, due to the loss of interest deductibility and lower rate base.\nXcel Energy believes that the industry and its customers are negatively impacted by the loss of interest deductibility. Accordingly, Xcel Energy will continue to work vigorously to advance the interests of customers and the industry.\nRegulation\nFERC and State Regulation - The FERC and various state and local regulatory commissions regulate Xcel Energy Inc.'s utility subsidiaries, TransCo subsidiaries and WGI. Decisions by these regulators can significantly impact Xcel Energy's results of operations. Xcel Energy expects to periodically file for rate changes based on changing operating costs, new or planned investments, fluctuations in energy markets and general economic conditions.\nThe electric and natural gas rates charged to customers of Xcel Energy Inc.'s utility subsidiaries are approved by the FERC or the regulatory commissions in the states in which they operate. The rates are designed to recover plant investment, operating costs and an allowed return on investment. Rates charged by Xcel Energy Inc.'s TransCo subsidiaries and WGI are approved by the FERC. Xcel Energy requests changes in rates for utility services through filings with the governing commissions. Changes in operating costs can affect Xcel Energy's financial results, depending on the timing of filing general rate cases and the implementation of final rates. In addition to changes in operating costs, other factors affecting rate filings are new investments, sales, conservation and DSM efforts, and the cost of capital. In addition, the regulatory commissions authorize the ROE, capital structure and depreciation rates in rate proceedings.\nWholesale Energy Market Regulation - Wholesale energy markets in the Midwest and South Central U.S. are operated by MISO and SPP, respectively, to centrally dispatch all regional electric generation and apply a regional transmission congestion management system. NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin are members of MISO and SPS is a member of SPP. NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin and SPS expect to recover energy charges through either base rates or various recovery mechanisms. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nCapital Expenditure Regulation - Xcel Energy Inc.'s utility subsidiaries make substantial investments in plant additions to build and upgrade power plants, and expand and maintain the reliability of the energy transmission and distribution systems. In addition to filings for increases in base rates charged to customers to recover the costs associated with such investments, the CPUC, MPUC, SDPUC, NDPSC and PUCT in certain instances have approved proposals to recover, through a rate rider, costs to upgrade generation plants and lower emissions, increased transmission investment costs, increased distribution investment costs, and increased purchased power capacity costs. These non-fuel rate riders are expected to provide cash flows to enable recovery of costs incurred on a more timely basis. For wholesale electric transmission and production services, Xcel Energy has, consistent with FERC policy, implemented formula rates for each of the utility subsidiaries that will provide annual rate changes as transmission or production investments increase in a manner similar to the retail rate riders. In November 2014, the FERC approved transmission formula rates for XETD and XEST, which would apply to electric transmission assets the TransCos may own. NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin have no cost-based wholesale production customers and therefore have not implemented a production formula rate.\nEnvironmental Matters\nEnvironmental costs include accruals for nuclear plant decommissioning and payments for storage of spent nuclear fuel, disposal of hazardous materials and waste, remediation of contaminated sites, monitoring of discharges to the environment and compliance with laws and permits with respect to emissions. A trend of greater environmental awareness and increasingly stringent regulation may continue to cause higher operating expenses and capital expenditures for environmental compliance.\nCosts charged to operating expenses for nuclear decommissioning and spent nuclear fuel disposal expenses, environmental monitoring and disposal of hazardous materials and waste were approximately:\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$304 million in 2016;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$292 million in 2015; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$292 million in 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nXcel Energy estimates an average annual expense of approximately $354 million from 2017 through 2021 for similar costs. The precise timing and amount of environmental costs, including those for site remediation and disposal of hazardous materials, are unknown. Additionally, the extent to which environmental costs will be included in and recovered through rates may fluctuate.\nCapital expenditures for environmental improvements at regulated facilities were approximately:\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$93 million in 2016;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$184 million in 2015; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$373 million in 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Item 7 - Capital Requirements for further discussion.\nXcel Energy's operations are subject to federal and state laws and regulations related to air emissions, water discharges and waste management from various sources. Such laws and regulations impose monitoring and reporting requirements and may require Xcel Energy to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of projects that increase air emissions, water discharges or land disposal of wastes, obtain and comply with permits that contain emission, discharge and operational limitations, or install or operate pollution control equipment at facilities. Xcel Energy will likely be required to incur capital expenditures in the future to comply with these requirements for remediation of MGP and other legacy sites and various regulations for air emissions, water intake and discharge and waste disposal. Actual expenditures could vary from the estimates presented. The scope and timing of these expenditures cannot be determined until any new or revised regulations become final or until more information is learned about the need for remediation at the legacy sites.\nPollution control equipment can be required by federal and state regulations, such as those requiring mercury emission reductions, and by state or federal implementation plans, such as those to address visibility impairment, interstate air pollution impacts or attainment of NAAQS. Xcel Energy has installed and is operating control equipment needed to comply with the requirements of the federal Mercury and Air Toxic Standards Rule. In 2016, the EPA adopted a federal visibility plan for Texas which imposes SO2 emission limitations that reflect installation of dry scrubbers on Tolk Units 1 and 2, with compliance required by early 2021. This rule has been stayed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (Fifth Circuit) until it reaches a decision on the merits of the rule.\nSee Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of Xcel Energy's environmental contingencies.\nInflation\nInflation at its current level is not expected to materially affect Xcel Energy's prices or returns to shareholders. However, potential future inflation could result from economic conditions or the economic and monetary policies of the U.S. Government and the Federal Reserve. This could lead to future price increases for materials and services required to deliver electric and natural gas services to customers. These potential cost increases could in turn lead to increased prices to customers. Likewise, lower oil prices lead to sustained deflation, that could also reduce general economic activity although it may lead to lower electric and natural gas prices to customers. Additionally, under statute, federal agencies such as FERC now can adjust statutory penalties for inflation.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nPreparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments could materially impact the consolidated financial statements and disclosures, based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment also may have a significant effect on the operation of the business and on the results reported. The following is a list of accounting policies and estimates that are most significant to the portrayal of Xcel Energy's financial condition and results, and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Each of these has a higher likelihood of resulting in materially different reported amounts under different conditions or using different assumptions. Each critical accounting policy has been reviewed and discussed with the Audit Committee of Xcel Energy Inc.'s Board of Directors on a quarterly basis.\nRegulatory Accounting\nXcel Energy Inc. is a holding company with rate-regulated subsidiaries that are subject to the accounting for Regulated Operations, which provides that rate-regulated entities report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates, if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates will be charged and collected. Xcel Energy's rates are derived through the ratemaking process, which results in the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities based on the probability of future cash flows. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred or accrued costs that have been deferred because future recovery from customers is probable. Regulatory liabilities generally represent amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers in future rates or amounts collected in current rates for future costs. In other businesses or industries, regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities would generally be charged to net income or OCI.\nEach reporting period Xcel Energy assesses the probability of future recoveries and obligations associated with regulatory assets and liabilities. Factors such as the current regulatory environment, recently issued rate orders and historical precedents are considered. Decisions made by regulatory agencies can directly impact the amount and timing of cost recovery as well as the rate of return on invested capital, and may materially impact Xcel Energy's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nAs of Dec. 31, 2016 and 2015, Xcel Energy has recorded regulatory assets of $3.4 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively and regulatory liabilities of $1.6 billion, for both periods. Each subsidiary is subject to regulation that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. If future recovery of costs, in any such jurisdiction, ceases to be probable, Xcel Energy would be required to charge these assets to current net income or OCI. In assessing the probability of recovery of recognized regulatory assets, Xcel Energy noted no current or anticipated proposals or changes in the regulatory environment that it expects will materially impact the probability of recovery of the assets. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of regulatory assets and liabilities and Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of rate matters.\nIncome Tax Accruals\nJudgment, uncertainty, and estimates are a significant aspect of the income tax accrual process that accounts for the effects of current and deferred income taxes. Uncertainty associated with the application of tax statutes and regulations and the outcomes of tax audits and appeals require that judgment and estimates be made in the accrual process and in the calculation of the ETR. Changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ETR in the future. At this time, due to the inherent uncertainty of future legislation, any potential resulting impact cannot be reasonably estimated.\nETRs are highly impacted by assumptions. ETR calculations are revised every quarter based on best available year-end tax assumptions (income levels, deductions, credits, etc.); adjusted in the following year after returns are filed, with the tax accrual estimates being trued-up to the actual amounts claimed on the tax returns; and further adjusted after examinations by taxing authorities have been completed.\nIn accordance with the interim period reporting guidance, income tax expense for the first three quarters in a year is based on the forecasted annual ETR. The forecasted ETR reflects a number of estimates including forecasted annual income, permanent tax adjustments and tax credits.\nAccounting for income taxes also requires that only tax benefits that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold can be recognized or continue to be recognized. The change in the unrecognized tax benefits needs to be reasonably estimated based on evaluation of the nature of uncertainty, the nature of event that could cause the change and an estimated range of reasonably possible changes. Management will use prudent business judgment to derecognize appropriate amounts of tax benefits at any period end, and as new developments occur. Unrecognized tax benefits can be recognized as issues are favorably resolved and loss exposures decline.\nWe may adjust our unrecognized tax benefits and interest accruals to the updated estimates as disputes with the IRS and state tax authorities are resolved. These adjustments may increase or decrease earnings. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nEmployee Benefits\nXcel Energy's pension costs are based on an actuarial calculation that includes a number of key assumptions, most notably the annual return level that pension and postretirement health care investment assets are expected to earn in the future and the interest rate used to discount future pension benefit payments to a present value obligation. In addition, the pension cost calculation uses an asset-smoothing methodology to reduce the volatility of varying investment performance over time. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the rate of return and discount rate used in the calculation of pension costs and obligations.\nPension costs are expected to increase in 2017 and then decline in the following few years. Funding requirements are expected to increase in 2017 and then be flat in the following years. While investment returns exceeded the assumed levels in 2014, investment returns were below the assumed levels in 2015 and 2016. The pension cost calculation uses a market-related valuation of pension assets. Xcel Energy uses a calculated value method to determine the market-related value of the plan assets. The market-related value is determined by adjusting the fair market value of assets at the beginning of the year to reflect the investment gains and losses (the difference between the actual investment return and the expected investment return on the market-related value) during each of the previous five years at the rate of 20 percent per year. As these differences between the actual investment returns and the expected investment returns are incorporated into the market-related value, the differences are recognized in pension cost over the expected average remaining years of service for active employees, which was approximately 12 years in 2016.\nBased on current assumptions and the recognition of past investment gains and losses, Xcel Energy currently projects the pension costs recognized for financial reporting purposes will be $121.9 million in 2017 and $115.2 million in 2018, while the actual pension costs were $121.7 million in 2016 and $127.7 million in 2015. The expected increase in 2017 costs is due primarily to the decrease in the discount rate, offset by improvements in the mortality assumption and a decrease to the long-term increase in compensation assumption. Further, future year costs are expected to decrease primarily as a result of reductions in loss amortizations and an increase in expected return on assets due to planned future contributions and expected return of current assets.\nIn 2014, the Society of Actuaries published a new mortality table (RP-2014) and projection scale (MP-2014) that increased the overall life expectancy of males and females. On Dec. 31, 2014 Xcel Energy adopted the RP-2014 table, with modifications, based on its population and specific experience and a modified MP-2014 projection scale. During 2016, a new projection table was released (MP-2016). In 2016, Xcel Energy adopted a modified version of the MP-2016 table and will continue to utilize the RP-2014 base table, modified for company experience.\nAt Dec. 31, 2016, Xcel Energy set the rate of return on assets used to measure pension costs at 6.87 percent, which is consistent with the rate set at Dec. 31, 2015. The rate of return used to measure postretirement health care costs is 5.80 percent at Dec. 31, 2016 and this is consistent with Dec. 31, 2015. Xcel Energy's ongoing investment strategy is based on plan-specific investment recommendations that seek to minimize potential investment and interest rate risk as a plan's funded status increases over time. The investment recommendations result in a greater percentage of interest rate sensitive securities being allocated to specific plans having relatively higher funded status ratios and a greater percentage of growth assets being allocated to plans having relatively lower funded status ratios.\nXcel Energy set the discount rates used to value the Dec. 31, 2016 pension and postretirement health care obligations each at 4.13 percent, which represents a 53 basis point and a 52 basis point decrease from Dec. 31, 2015, respectively. Xcel Energy uses a bond matching study as its primary basis for determining the discount rate used to value pension and postretirement health care obligations. The bond matching study utilizes a portfolio of high grade (Aa or higher) bonds that matches the expected cash flows of Xcel Energy's benefit plans in amount and duration. The effective yield on this cash flow matched bond portfolio determines the discount rate for the individual plans. The bond matching study is validated for reasonableness against the Citigroup Pension Liability Discount Curve and the Citigroup Above Median Curve. At Dec. 31, 2016, these reference points supported the selected rate. In addition to these reference points, Xcel Energy also reviews general actuarial survey data to assess the reasonableness of the discount rate selected.\nThe following are the pension funding contributions across all four of Xcel Energy's pension plans, both voluntary and required, for 2014 through 2017:\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$150.0 million in January 2017;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$125.2 million in 2016;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$90.1 million in 2015; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$130.6 million in 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor future years, we anticipate contributions will be made as necessary. These contributions are summarized in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. Future year amounts are estimates and may change based on actual market performance, changes in interest rates and any changes in governmental regulations. Therefore, additional contributions could be required in the future.\nIf Xcel Energy were to use alternative assumptions at Dec. 31, 2016, a one-percent change would result in the following impact on 2016 pension costs:\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Pension Costs\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Millions of Dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-1%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of return\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(13.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>These costs include the effects of regulation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEffective Jan. 1, 2017, the initial medical trend assumption decreased from 6.00 percent to 5.50 percent. The ultimate trend assumption remained at 4.5 percent. The period until the ultimate rate is reached is two years. Xcel Energy bases its medical trend assumption on the long-term cost inflation expected in the health care market, considering the levels projected and recommended by industry experts, as well as recent actual medical cost experienced by Xcel Energy's retiree medical plan.\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Xcel Energy contributed $17.9 million, $18.3 million and $17.1 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, to the postretirement health care plans.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 206: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Xcel Energy expects to contribute approximately $11.8 million during 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nXcel Energy recovers employee benefits costs in its regulated utility operations consistent with accounting guidance with the exception of the areas noted below.\nTable 207: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>NSP-Minnesota recognizes pension expense in all regulatory jurisdictions as calculated using the aggregate normal cost actuarial method.

These AROs are recognized at fair value as incurred and are capitalized as part of the cost of the related long-lived assets. In the absence of quoted market prices, Xcel Energy estimates the fair value of its AROs using present value techniques, in which it makes various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, credit-adjusted risk free rates and cost escalation rates. When Xcel Energy revises any assumptions used to estimate AROs, it adjusts the carrying amount of both the ARO liability and the related long-lived asset. Xcel Energy accretes ARO liabilities to reflect the passage of time using the interest method.\nA significant portion of Xcel Energy's AROs relates to the future decommissioning of NSP-Minnesota's nuclear facilities. The total obligation for nuclear decommissioning is expected to be funded by the external decommissioning trust fund. The difference between regulatory funding (including depreciation expense less returns from the external trust fund) and expense recognized under current accounting guidance is deferred as a regulatory asset. The amounts recorded for AROs related to future nuclear decommissioning were $2.249 billion and $2.141 billion as of Dec. 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Based on their significance, the following discussion relates specifically to the AROs associated with nuclear decommissioning.\nNSP-Minnesota obtains periodic cost studies in order to estimate the cost and timing of planned nuclear decommissioning activities. These independent cost studies are based on relevant information available at the time performed. Estimates of future cash flows for extended periods of time are by nature highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. NSP-Minnesota is required to file a nuclear decommissioning filing every three years. The filing covers all expenses over the decommissioning period of the nuclear plants, including decontamination and removal of radioactive material. The MPUC approved NSP-Minnesota's most recent decommissioning filing in October 2015. The next filing is expected to be submitted in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe following key assumptions have a significant effect on the estimated nuclear obligation:\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Timing - Decommissioning cost estimates are impacted by each facility's retirement date and the expected timing of the actual decommissioning activities. Currently, the estimated retirement dates coincide with the expiration of each unit's operating license with the NRC (i.e., 2030 for Monticello and 2033 and 2034 for PI's Unit 1 and 2, respectively). The estimated timing of the decommissioning activities is based upon the DECON method, which assumes prompt removal and dismantlement. The use of the DECON method is required by the MPUC. By utilizing this method, decommissioning activities are expected to begin at the end of the license date and be completed for both facilities by 2091.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Technology and Regulation - There is limited experience with actual decommissioning of large nuclear facilities. Changes in technology and experience as well as changes in regulations regarding nuclear decommissioning could cause cost estimates to change significantly. NSP-Minnesota's most recent nuclear decommissioning filing assumed current technology and regulations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Escalation Rates - Escalation rates represent projected cost increases over time due to both general inflation and increases in the cost of specific decommissioning activities. NSP-Minnesota used an escalation rate of 4.36 percent in calculating the AROs related to nuclear decommissioning for the remaining operational period through the radiological decommissioning period. An escalation rate of 3.36 percent was utilized for the period of operating costs related to interim dry cask storage of spent nuclear fuel and site restoration.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Discount Rates - Changes in timing or estimated expected cash flows that result in upward revisions to the ARO are calculated using the then-current credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. The credit-adjusted risk-free rate in effect when the change occurs is used to discount the revised estimate of the incremental expected cash flows of the retirement activity. If the change in timing or estimated expected cash flows results in a downward revision of the ARO, the undiscounted revised estimate of expected cash flows is discounted using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate in effect at the date of initial measurement and recognition of the original ARO. Discount rates ranging from approximately four to seven percent have been used to calculate the net present value of the expected future cash flows over time.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSignificant uncertainties exist in estimating the future cost of nuclear decommissioning including the method to be utilized, the ultimate costs to decommission, and the planned method of disposing spent fuel. If different cost estimates, life assumptions or cost escalation rates were utilized, the AROs could change materially. However, changes in estimates have minimal impact on results of operations as NSP-Minnesota expects to continue to recover all costs in future rates.\nXcel Energy continually makes judgments and estimates related to these critical accounting policy areas, based on an evaluation of the varying assumptions and uncertainties for each area. The information and assumptions underlying many of these judgments and estimates will be affected by events beyond the control of Xcel Energy, or otherwise change over time. This may require adjustments to recorded results to better reflect the events and updated information that becomes available. The accompanying financial statements reflect management's best estimates and judgments of the impact of these factors as of Dec. 31, 2016.\nDerivatives, Risk Management and Market Risk\nXcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries are exposed to a variety of market risks in the normal course of business. Market risk is the potential loss that may occur as a result of adverse changes in the market or fair value of a particular instrument or commodity. All financial and commodity-related instruments, including derivatives, are subject to market risk. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of market risks associated with derivatives.\nXcel Energy is exposed to the impact of adverse changes in price for energy and energy-related products, which is partially mitigated by the use of commodity derivatives. In addition to ongoing monitoring and maintaining credit policies intended to minimize overall credit risk, when necessary, management takes steps to mitigate changes in credit and concentration risks associated with its derivatives and other contracts, including parental guarantees and requests of collateral. While Xcel Energy expects that the counterparties will perform under the contracts underlying its derivatives, the contracts expose Xcel Energy to some credit and non-performance risk.\nThough no material non-performance risk currently exists with the counterparties to Xcel Energy's commodity derivative contracts, distress in the financial markets may in the future impact that risk to the extent it impacts those counterparties. Distress in the financial markets may also impact the fair value of the securities in the nuclear decommissioning fund and master pension trust, as well as Xcel Energy's ability to earn a return on short-term investments of excess cash.\nCommodity Price Risk - Xcel Energy Inc.'s utility subsidiaries are exposed to commodity price risk in their electric and natural gas operations. Commodity price risk is managed by entering into long- and short-term physical purchase and sales contracts for electric capacity, energy and energy-related products and for various fuels used in generation and distribution activities. Commodity price risk is also managed through the use of financial derivative instruments. Xcel Energy's risk management policy allows it to manage commodity price risk within each rate-regulated operation to the extent such exposure exists.\nWholesale and Commodity Trading Risk - Xcel Energy Inc.'s utility subsidiaries conduct various wholesale and commodity trading activities, including the purchase and sale of electric capacity, energy, energy-related instruments and natural gas-related instruments, including derivatives.

At Dec. 31, 2015, a 10 percent increase in market prices for commodity trading contracts would increase pretax income by approximately $0.3 million, whereas a 10 percent decrease would decrease pretax income by approximately $0.3 million.\nXcel Energy Inc.'s utility subsidiaries' wholesale and commodity trading operations measure the outstanding risk exposure to price changes on transactions, contracts and obligations that have been entered into, but not closed, using an industry standard methodology known as Value at Risk (VaR). VaR expresses the potential change in fair value on the outstanding transactions, contracts and obligations over a particular period of time under normal market conditions.\nThe VaRs for the NSP-Minnesota and PSCo commodity trading operations, calculated on a consolidated basis using a Monte Carlo simulation with a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, were as follows:\nTable 216: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Millions of Dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDec. 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>VaR Limit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>High\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Low\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.06\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNuclear Fuel Supply - NSP-Minnesota is scheduled to take delivery of approximately 13 percent of its 2017 and approximately 56 percent of its 2018 enriched nuclear material requirements from sources that could be impacted by events in Ukraine and sanctions against Russia. Alternate potential sources are expected to provide the flexibility to manage NSP-Minnesota's nuclear fuel supply to ensure that plant availability and reliability will not be negatively impacted in the near-term. Long-term, through 2024, NSP-Minnesota is scheduled to take delivery of approximately 31 percent of its average enriched nuclear material requirements from sources that could be impacted by events in Ukraine and extended sanctions against Russia. NSP-Minnesota is closely following the progression of these events and will periodically assess if further actions are required to assure a secure supply of enriched nuclear material.\nInterest Rate Risk - Xcel Energy is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. Xcel Energy's risk management policy allows interest rate risk to be managed through the use of fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and interest rate derivatives such as swaps, caps, collars and put or call options.\nAt Dec. 31, 2016 and 2015, a 100 basis point change in the benchmark rate on Xcel Energy's variable rate debt would impact annual pretax interest expense by approximately $3.9 million and $8.5 million, respectively. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of Xcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries' interest rate derivatives.\nNSP-Minnesota also maintains a nuclear decommissioning fund, as required by the NRC. The nuclear decommissioning fund is subject to interest rate risk and equity price risk. At Dec. 31, 2016, the fund was invested in a diversified portfolio of cash equivalents, debt securities, equity securities and other investments. These investments may be used only for activities related to nuclear decommissioning. Given the purpose and legal restrictions on the use of nuclear decommissioning fund assets, realized and unrealized gains on fund investments over the life of the fund are deferred as an offset of NSP-Minnesota's regulatory asset for nuclear decommissioning costs. Consequently, any realized and unrealized gains and losses on securities in the nuclear decommissioning fund, including any other-than-temporary impairments, are deferred as a component of the regulatory asset for nuclear decommissioning. Since the accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that costs are recovered through rates, fluctuations in equity prices or interest rates affecting the nuclear decommissioning fund do not have a direct impact on earnings.\nCredit Risk - Xcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries are also exposed to credit risk. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from counterparties' nonperformance on their contractual obligations. Xcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries maintain credit policies intended to minimize overall credit risk and actively monitor these policies to reflect changes and scope of operations.\nAt Dec. 31, 2016, a 10 percent increase in commodity prices would have resulted in an increase in credit exposure of $5.7 million, while a decrease in prices of 10 percent would have resulted in an increase in credit exposure of $16.6 million. At Dec. 31, 2015, a 10 percent increase in commodity prices would have resulted in a decrease in credit exposure of $1.9 million, while a decrease in prices of 10 percent would have resulted in an increase in credit exposure of $6.1 million.\nXcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries conduct standard credit reviews for all counterparties. Xcel Energy employs additional credit risk control mechanisms when appropriate, such as letters of credit, parental guarantees, standardized master netting agreements and termination provisions that allow for offsetting of positive and negative exposures. Credit exposure is monitored and, when necessary, the activity with a specific counterparty is limited until credit enhancement is provided. Distress in the financial markets could increase Xcel Energy's credit risk.\nFair Value Measurements\nXcel Energy follows accounting and disclosure guidance on fair value measurements that contains a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value and requires disclosure of the observability of the inputs used in these measurements. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the fair value hierarchy and the amounts of assets and liabilities measured at fair value that have been assigned to Level 3.\nCommodity Derivatives - Xcel Energy continuously monitors the creditworthiness of the counterparties to its commodity derivative contracts and assesses each counterparty's ability to perform on the transactions set forth in the contracts. Given this assessment and the typically short duration of these contracts, the impact of discounting commodity derivative assets for counterparty credit risk was not material to the fair value of commodity derivative assets at Dec. 31, 2016. Adjustments to fair value for credit risk of commodity trading instruments are recorded in electric revenues. Credit risk adjustments for other commodity derivative instruments are deferred as OCI or regulatory assets and liabilities. The classification as a regulatory asset or liability is based on commission approved regulatory recovery mechanisms. Xcel Energy also assesses the impact of its own credit risk when determining the fair value of commodity derivative liabilities. The impact of discounting commodity derivative liabilities for credit risk was immaterial to the fair value of commodity derivative liabilities at Dec. 31, 2016.\nCommodity derivative assets and liabilities assigned to Level 3 typically consist of FTRs, as well as forwards and options that are long-term in nature. Level 3 commodity derivative assets and liabilities represent 1.0 percent and 3.9 percent of gross assets and liabilities, respectively, measured at fair value at Dec. 31, 2016.\nDetermining the fair value of FTRs requires numerous management forecasts that vary in observability, including various forward commodity prices, retail and wholesale demand, generation and resulting transmission system congestion. Given the limited observability of management's forecasts for several of these inputs, these instruments have been assigned a Level 3. Level 3 commodity derivatives assets and liabilities included $19.3 million and $2.0 million of estimated fair values, respectively, for FTRs held at Dec. 31, 2016.\nDetermining the fair value of certain commodity forwards and options can require management to make use of subjective price and volatility forecasts which extend to periods beyond those readily observable on active exchanges or quoted by brokers. When less observable forward price and volatility forecasts are significant to determining the value of commodity forwards and options, these instruments are assigned to Level 3. Level 3 commodity derivative liabilities included an immaterial estimated fair value for forwards held at Dec. 31, 2016. There were no Level 3 options held at Dec. 31, 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nTable 217: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Millions of Dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $14 million for 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to timing of vendor payments and higher net income, excluding amounts related to non-cash operating activities (e.g., depreciation, deferred tax expenses and a charge related to the Monticello LCM/EPU project in 2015), partially offset by timing of customer receipts, refunds and recovery of certain electric and natural gas riders and incentive programs.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $379 million for 2015 as compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to rate increases in various jurisdictions, higher customer refunds in 2014 and income tax refunds received in 2015 compared to taxes paid in 2014, partially offset by refunds issued as part of a settlement agreement with Golden Spread and PNM in 2015.\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Millions of Dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,261\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,623\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,117\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $362 million for 2016 as compared to 2015.

In order to secure the full benefit of the PTC for potential wind projects at Xcel Energy subsidiaries, Capital Services made deposits of $200 million toward the purchase of wind turbine components under the contract in 2016.\nThe capital expenditure programs of Xcel Energy are subject to continuing review and modification. Actual capital expenditures may vary from the estimates due to changes in electric and natural gas projected load growth, regulatory decisions, legislative initiatives, reserve margin requirements, the availability of purchased power, alternative plans for meeting long-term energy needs, compliance with environmental requirements, renewable portfolio standards and merger, acquisition and divestiture opportunities. The table above does not include potential expenditures of Xcel Energy's transmission-only subsidiaries.\nXcel Energy issues debt and equity securities to refinance retiring maturities, reduce short-term debt, fund capital programs, infuse equity in subsidiaries, fund asset acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes.

Federal law places certain limits on the ability of public utilities within a holding company system to declare dividends.\nSpecifically, under the Federal Power Act, a public utility may not pay dividends from any funds properly included in a capital account. The utility subsidiaries' dividends may be limited directly or indirectly by state regulatory commissions or bond indenture covenants. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of restrictions on dividend payments.\nRegulation of Derivatives - In July 2010, financial reform legislation was passed that provides for the regulation of derivative transactions amongst other provisions. Provisions within the bill provide the CFTC and the SEC with expanded regulatory authority over derivative and swap transactions. The CFTC ruled that swap dealing activity conducted by entities for the preceding 12 months under a notional limit, initially set at $8 billion, will fall under the general de minimis threshold and will not subject an entity to registering as a swap dealer. The de minimis threshold is scheduled to be reduced to $3 billion in 2018. Xcel Energy's current and projected swap activity is well below these de minimis thresholds. The bill also contains provisions that exempt certain derivatives end users from much of the clearing and margin requirements and Xcel Energy's Board of Directors has renewed the end-user exemption on an annual basis. Xcel Energy is currently meeting all reporting requirements and transaction restrictions.\nPension Fund - Xcel Energy's pension assets are invested in a diversified portfolio of domestic and international equity securities, short-term to long-duration fixed income and interest rate swap securities, and alternative investments, including private equity, real estate, hedge funds and commodity investments.\nThe funded status and pension assumptions are summarized in the following tables:\nTable 238: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Millions of Dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dec. 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dec. 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value of pension assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Projected pension obligation (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,568\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funded status\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(826\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(684\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 239: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Excludes nonqualified plan of $44 million and $42 million at Dec. 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 240: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension Assumptions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.66\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected long-term rate of return\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.87\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital Sources\nShort-Term Funding Sources - Xcel Energy uses a number of sources to fulfill short-term funding needs, including operating cash flow, notes payable, commercial paper and bank lines of credit. The amount and timing of short-term funding needs depend in large part on financing needs for construction expenditures, working capital and dividend payments.\nShort-Term Investments - Xcel Energy Inc., NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin, PSCo and SPS maintain cash operating and short-term investment accounts. At Dec. 31, 2016 and 2015, there was $3.6 million and $3.3 million of cash held in these accounts, respectively.\nCommercial Paper - Xcel Energy Inc., NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin, PSCo and SPS each have individual commercial paper programs.

The utility money pool allows for short-term investments in and borrowings between the utility subsidiaries. Xcel Energy Inc. may make investments in the utility subsidiaries at market-based interest rates; however, the money pool arrangement does not allow the utility subsidiaries to make investments in Xcel Energy Inc. The money pool balances are eliminated in consolidation.\nNSP-Minnesota, PSCo and SPS participate in the money pool pursuant to approval from their respective state regulatory commissions. NSP-Wisconsin does not participate in the money pool.\nRegistration Statements - Xcel Energy Inc.'s Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of one billion shares of $2.50 par value common stock. As of Dec. 31, 2016 and 2015, Xcel Energy Inc. had approximately 507 million shares and 508 million shares of common stock outstanding, respectively. In addition, Xcel Energy Inc.'s Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of seven million shares of $100 par value preferred stock. Xcel Energy Inc. had no shares of preferred stock outstanding on Dec. 31, 2016 and 2015.\nXcel Energy Inc. and its utility subsidiaries have registration statements on file with the SEC pursuant to which they may sell securities from time to time.

and Results of Operations\nBusiness Segments and Organizational Overview\nXcel Energy Inc. is a public utility holding company. Xcel Energy's operations included the activity of four utility subsidiaries that serve electric and natural gas customers in eight states. These utility subsidiaries are NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin, PSCo and SPS. These utilities serve customers in portions of Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin. Along with the TransCo subsidiaries, WYCO, a joint venture formed with CIG to develop and lease natural gas pipelines, storage and compression facilities, and WGI, an interstate natural gas pipeline company, these companies comprise the regulated utility operations.\nXcel Energy Inc.'s nonregulated subsidiaries are Eloigne and Capital Services. Eloigne invests in rental housing projects that qualify for low-income housing tax credits, and Capital Services procures equipment for construction of renewable generation facilities at other subsidiaries.\nForward-Looking Statements\nExcept for the historical statements contained in this report, the matters discussed herein are forward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Such forward-looking statements, including the 2017 EPS guidance and assumptions, are intended to be identified in this document by the words anticipate,\u201d believe,\u201d estimate,\u201d expect,\u201d intend,\u201d may,\u201d objective,\u201d outlook,\u201d plan,\u201d project,\u201d possible,\u201d potential,\u201d should\u201d and similar expressions. Actual results may vary materially. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we expressly disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking information. The following factors, in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2016 (including the items described under Factors Affecting Results of Operations; and the other risk factors listed from time to time by Xcel Energy Inc. in reports filed with the SEC, including Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Exhibit 99.01 hereto), could cause actual results to differ materially from management expectations as suggested by such forward-looking information: general economic conditions, including inflation rates, monetary fluctuations and their impact on capital expenditures and the ability of Xcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries to obtain financing on favorable terms; business conditions in the energy industry, including the risk of a slow down in the U.S. economy or delay in growth, recovery, trade, fiscal, taxation and environmental policies in areas where Xcel Energy has a financial interest; customer business conditions; actions of credit rating agencies; competitive factors including the extent and timing of the entry of additional competition in the markets served by Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries; unusual weather; effects of geopolitical events, including war and acts of terrorism; cyber security threats and data security breaches; state, federal and foreign legislative and regulatory initiatives that affect cost and investment recovery, have an impact on rates or have an impact on asset operation or ownership or impose environmental compliance conditions; structures that affect the speed and degree to which competition enters the electric and natural gas markets; costs and other effects of legal and administrative proceedings, settlements, investigations and claims; financial or regulatory accounting policies imposed by regulatory bodies; outcomes of regulatory proceedings; availability of cost of capital; and employee work force factors.\nManagement's Strategic Priorities\nXcel Energy strives to provide our investors an attractive value proposition and our customers with safe, clean and reliable energy services at a competitive price. This mission is enabled via five key strategic priorities:\n \u2022 Invest in infrastructure; \n \u2022 Improve the customer experience; \n \u2022 Advance the regulatory framework and performance; \n \u2022 Transition the power generation fleet; and \n \u2022 Provide a competitive total return to investors and maintain strong investment grade credit ratings. \nBelow is a discussion of these objectives.\nInvest in infrastructure\nSound investments today are necessary for tomorrow's success. Our capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $18.4 billion from 2017 through 2021. This capital investment profile will grow our consolidated rate base at a compounded average annual rate of approximately 5.5 percent. Our capital plan includes investments in renewables, transmission, distribution, electric generation, natural gas and other parts of our utility business. Our plan includes approximately $1.3 billion of investment for grid modernization to improve the customer experience, enhance grid reliability and enable new and innovative programs and rate structures. In addition, we plan to invest $2.2 billion in gas infrastructure to enhance safety, reliability and operational performance for the benefit of our customers and communities.\nImprove the customer experience\nThe utility landscape is changing, and we must continue to thoughtfully anticipate and address the future needs of our stakeholders, including our customers, policymakers, employees and shareholders. Adapting to this changing environment is critical to our long-term success. Our customers expect to have choices, and we are committed to providing options and solutions that they want and value at a competitive price. Our continued investment in clean energy is an example of this commitment to our customers. Environmental stewardship remains foundational to Xcel Energy and is designed to meet customer and policy maker expectations while creating shareholder value. We will continue to offer and expand our production of renewable energy, including wind and solar alternatives, and further develop and promote DSM, conservation and renewable programs.\nAdvance the regulatory framework and performance\nXcel Energy is a holding company comprised primarily of several utility operating companies. As part of the regulatory process, each state will generally establish an authorized ROE. In many states, our utility operating companies earn less than the authorized ROE due to numerous factors including the timing of implementation of new rates, timing of capital investments, a regulatory commission not allowing the recovery of certain costs, the time period used as a test year for rate cases, fluctuations in sales, the impact of weather, unanticipated cost increases, etc. The difference between the authorized ROE and the earned ROE is referred to as an ROE gap. Xcel Energy is focused on reducing this gap.\nWe continue to pursue regulatory and legislative changes to streamline rate case proceedings and optimize recovery, while improving our alignment with state policies and keeping pace with evolving customer preferences.\nIn addition, keeping our costs competitive is also essential in terms of customer affordability and improving ROE over time. Xcel Energy is working to keep O&M expense relatively flat without compromising reliability or safety. We intend to accomplish this objective by continually improving our processes, leveraging technology, proactively managing risk and maintaining a workforce that is prepared to meet the needs of our business today and tomorrow.\nTransition the power generation fleet\nFor more than a decade, we have managed the risk of climate change through a clean energy strategy that consistently reduces carbon emissions and transitions our operations for the future. We continue to provide shareholder value while transforming how we produce, deliver and encourage the efficient use of energy through four primary mechanisms:\n \u2022 Increasing the use of renewable energy; \n \u2022 Offering energy efficiency programs for customers; \n \u2022 Retiring or repowering coals units and modernizing our generating plants; and \n \u2022 Advancing power grid capabilities. \nOur service territories benefit from the geographic concentration of favorable renewable resources. Strong wind and high solar irradiance yield high generation capacity factors and consequently lowers the cost of these resources.\nThe combination of high capacity factors, a strong transmission network, improved supply chain, technological improvements and the extension of the renewable tax credits translates into low renewable energy costs for our customers. As a result, we have a beneficial opportunity to invest in renewable generation, in which the capital costs are largely or completely offset by fuel savings. This provides us the opportunity to lower the emission profile of our generation fleet, grow our renewable portfolio and provide significant fuel savings to our customers.\nOur capital forecast for 2017-2021 includes $3.5 billion of investment in renewable generation. This includes the following projects:\n \u2022 The 600 MW Rush Creek wind project in Colorado, which was approved by the CPUC in 2016; \n \u2022 A proposal to build and own 750 MW of new wind generation at NSP-Minnesota. This project is pending MPUC approval; and \n \u2022 Plans to spend an additional $1.5 billion on other renewable projects in our various states. This could include our preliminary plans to add 500-1,000 MW of wind generation at SPS. \nEmission reductions are an important driver of our strategy. Since 2005, we have reduced carbon emissions 30 percent and are projected to achieve an approximate 43 percent reduction by 2021.\nProvide a competitive total return to investors and maintain strong investment grade credit\nSuccessful execution of our strategic objectives should allow Xcel Energy to continue to deliver a competitive total return for our shareholders. Through our disciplined approach to business growth, financial investment, operations and safety, we plan to:\n \u2022 Deliver long-term annual EPS growth of four percent to six percent; \n \u2022 Deliver annual dividend increases of five percent to seven percent; \n \u2022 Target a dividend payout ratio of 60 to 70 percent of annual ongoing EPS; and \n \u2022 Maintain senior unsecured debt credit ratings in the BBB+ to A range. \nWe have successfully achieved our prior financial objectives, meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance range for twelve consecutive years and believe we are positioned to continue to deliver on our value proposition. Our ongoing earnings have grown approximately 6.1 percent and our dividend has grown approximately 4.3 percent annually from 2005 through 2016. In addition, our current senior unsecured debt credit ratings for Xcel Energy and its utility subsidiaries are in the BBB+ to A range.\nFinancial Review\nThe following discussion and analysis by management focuses on those factors that had a material effect on Xcel Energy's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows during the periods presented, or are expected to have a material impact in the future. It should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the related notes to consolidated financial statements.\nThe only common equity securities that are publicly traded are common shares of Xcel Energy Inc. The diluted earnings and EPS of each subsidiary as well as the ROE of each subsidiary discussed below do not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities allocated to such subsidiary but rather represent a direct interest in our assets and liabilities as a whole. Ongoing diluted EPS and ongoing ROE for Xcel Energy and by subsidiary are financial measures not recognized under GAAP. Ongoing diluted EPS is calculated by dividing the net income or loss attributable to the controlling interest of each subsidiary, adjusted for certain nonrecurring items, by the weighted average fully diluted Xcel Energy Inc. common shares outstanding for the period. Ongoing ROE is calculated by dividing the net income or loss attributable to the controlling interest of Xcel Energy or each subsidiary, adjusted for certain nonrecurring items, by each entity's average common stockholders' or stockholder's equity. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and provide details of earnings results. We believe these measurements are useful to investors to evaluate the actual and projected financial performance and contribution of our subsidiaries. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes the diluted EPS for Xcel Energy:\n\n (a) Amounts may not add due to rounding. \nOngoing earnings for 2015 excludes an adjustment related to the Monticello nuclear facility LCM/EPU project. See below as well as Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nXcel Energy's management believes that ongoing earnings provide a meaningful comparison of earnings results and is representative of Xcel Energy's fundamental core earnings power. Xcel Energy's management uses ongoing earnings internally for financial planning and analysis, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors, in determining whether performance targets are met for performance-based compensation and when communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors.\n2015 Adjustment to GAAP Earnings\nLoss on Monticello LCM/EPU Project - In March 2015, the MPUC approved full recovery, including a return, on $415 million of the project costs, inclusive of AFUDC, but only allowed recovery of the remaining $333 million of costs with no return on this portion of the investment for 2015 and beyond. As a result of this decision, Xcel Energy recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $129 million, or $79 million net of tax, in the first quarter of 2015. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nEarnings Adjusted for Certain Items\n2016 Comparison with 2015\nXcel Energy - 2016 GAAP earnings increased due to the 2015 loss on Monticello LCM/EPU project, see Note 12 for further information. In addition, GAAP and ongoing earnings increased $0.12 per share. Increases in electric and natural gas margins were primarily driven by higher rates and riders across various jurisdictions to recover our capital investments and the favorable impact of weather as compared with the previous year. These positive factors and a lower ETR were partially offset by higher depreciation, interest charges and property taxes.\nNSP-Minnesota - 2016 GAAP earnings increased due to the 2015 loss on Monticello LCM/EPU project, see Note 12 for further information. In addition, GAAP and ongoing earnings increased $0.11 per share due to the following: higher electric margins primarily driven by an interim electric rate increase in Minnesota (net of estimated provision for refund); non-fuel riders; the favorable impact of weather; and a lower ETR. These positive factors were partially offset by higher depreciation, O&M expenses, interest charges and property taxes\nPSCo - Earnings decreased $0.01 per share for 2016. The positive impact of higher natural gas margins (primarily due to a rate increase), sales growth and a lower estimated electric earnings test refund, were more than offset by increased depreciation and interest charges.\nSPS - Earnings increased $0.05 per share for 2016. Higher electric margins and lower O&M expenses were partially offset by an increase in depreciation and interest charges.\nNSP-Wisconsin - Earnings decreased $0.01 per share for 2016. The positive impact of higher electric margins (primarily driven by an electric rate increase) was more than offset by higher O&M expenses and depreciation.\nEquity earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries - Earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries increased $0.01 per share in 2016 due to facility expansion and increased sales at WYCO.\nXcel Energy Inc. and other - Xcel Energy Inc. and other includes financing costs at the holding company and other items.\nThe decrease in earnings was primarily related to higher long-term debt levels.\n2015 Comparison with 2014\nXcel Energy - Twelve month year-over-year GAAP earnings decreased due to the 2015 loss on Monticello LCM/EPU project, refer to Note 12 for further information. Ongoing earnings increased $0.06 per share for 2015 primarily due to rate increases in various jurisdictions, non-fuel riders, a lower earnings test refund in Colorado and a decline in O&M expenses. These positive factors were partially offset by the impact of negative weather as well as higher depreciation, property taxes, interest charges and lower AFUDC.\nNSP-Minnesota - Twelve month year-over-year GAAP earnings decreased due to the 2015 loss on Monticello LCM/EPU project, refer to Note 12 for further information. Ongoing earnings increased $0.05 per share for 2015 and were positively impacted by electric rate increases in Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota, and lower O&M expenses. These positive factors were partially offset by unfavorable weather, sales decline, higher depreciation, increased interest charges, property taxes and lower AFUDC.\nPSCo - Earnings increased $0.02 per share for 2015. Higher revenue primarily due to the CACJA rider (partially offset by an electric base rate decrease), as well as a natural gas rate increase, effective in October 2015, lower estimated electric earnings test refunds and the positive impact of weather. These positive factors were partially offset by higher property taxes, depreciation, O&M expenses, interest charges and lower AFUDC.\nSPS - Earnings decreased $0.01 per share for 2015. Although Texas electric rates rose as a result of the prior year rate case, this was reduced by the negative impact of the 2015 case. The net increase in electric rates was more than offset by additional depreciation, higher O&M expenses and lower AFUDC.\nNSP-Wisconsin - Earnings increased $0.01 per share for 2015. Higher electric revenues primarily driven by an electric rate increase and lower O&M expenses were partially offset by higher depreciation and lower natural gas margins.\nChanges in Diluted EPS\nThe following table summarizes significant components contributing to the changes in 2016 EPS compared with the same period in 2015:\n\n\n (a) Amounts may not add due to rounding. \nThe following table summarizes the ROE for Xcel Energy and its utility subsidiaries:\n\n\nThe following tables provide reconciliations of ongoing to GAAP earnings (net income) and ongoing to GAAP diluted EPS for the years ended Dec. 31:\n\n\n (a) Amounts may not add due to rounding. \nStatement of Income Analysis\nThe following discussion summarizes the items that affected the individual revenue and expense items reported in the consolidated statements of income.\nEstimated Impact of Temperature Changes on Regulated Earnings - Unusually hot summers or cold winters increase electric and natural gas sales, while mild weather reduces electric and natural gas sales. The estimated impact of weather on earnings is based on the number of customers, temperature variances and the amount of natural gas or electricity the average customer historically uses per degree of temperature. Accordingly, deviations in weather from normal levels can affect Xcel Energy's financial performance.\nDegree-day or Temperature-Humidity Index (THI) data is used to estimate amounts of energy required to maintain comfortable indoor temperature levels based on each day's average temperature and humidity. Heating degree-days (HDD) is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature falls below 65\u00b0 Fahrenheit. Cooling degree-days (CDD) is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature rises above 65\u00b0 Fahrenheit. Each degree of temperature above 65\u00b0 Fahrenheit is counted as one CDD, and each degree of temperature below 65\u00b0 Fahrenheit is counted as one HDD. In Xcel Energy's more humid service territories, a THI is used in place of CDD, which adds a humidity factor to CDD. HDD, CDD and THI are most likely to impact the usage of Xcel Energy's residential and commercial customers. Industrial customers are less sensitive to weather.\nNormal weather conditions are defined as either the 20-year or 30-year average of actual historical weather conditions. The historical period of time used in the calculation of normal weather differs by jurisdiction, based on regulatory practice. To calculate the impact of weather on demand, a demand factor is applied to the weather impact on sales as defined above to derive the amount of demand associated with the weather impact.\nThe percentage increase (decrease) in normal and actual HDD, CDD and THI are provided in the following table:\n\nWeather - The following table summarizes the estimated impact of temperature variations on EPS compared with sales under normal weather conditions:\n\nSales Growth (Decline) - The following tables summarize Xcel Energy and its utility subsidiaries' sales growth (decline) for actual and weather-normalized sales for the years ended Dec. 31, compared with the previous year:\n\n\n\n(a) Extreme weather variations and additional factors such as windchill and cloud cover may not be reflected in weather-normalized and actual growth estimates.\n (b) The estimated impact of the 2016 leap day is excluded to present a more comparable year-over-year presentation. The estimated impact of the additional day of sales in 2016 was approximately 20-40 basis points for retail electric and 50 basis points for firm natural gas for the twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2016. \nWeather-normalized Electric 2016 Sales Growth (Decline) - Excluding Leap Day\n \u2022 NSP-Minnesota's residential sales decreased as a result of lower use per customer, partially offset by customer additions. C&I sales declined primarily as a result of lower use by customers in the manufacturing and service industries. \n \u2022 PSCo's residential growth reflects an increased number of customers. The C&I decline was mainly due to lower sales to certain large customers in the manufacturing, mining, oil and gas industries. The decline was partially offset by an increase in the number of small C&I customers. \n \u2022 SPS' residential sales decline was primarily the result of lower use per customer, partially offset by an increased number of customers. The increase in C&I sales was driven by energy sector expansion in the Southeastern New Mexico, Permian Basin area as well as greater use by agricultural customers. \n \u2022 NSP-Wisconsin's residential sales decrease was primarily attributable to lower use per customer, partially offset by customer additions. The C&I decline was largely due to reduced sales to small customers. The overall decrease was partially offset by an increase in the number of C&I customers as well as greater use in the large C&I class for the oil and gas industries. \nWeather-normalized Natural Gas 2016 Sales Decline - Excluding Leap Day\n \u2022 Across natural gas service territories, lower natural gas sales reflect a decline in customer use, partially offset by a slight increase in the number of customers. \nWeather-normalized sales for 2017 are projected to increase approximately 0 percent to 0.5 percent for retail electric and firm natural gas customers, respectively.\n\n\n(a) Extreme weather variations and additional factors such as windchill and cloud cover may not be reflected in weather-normalized and actual growth estimates.\nWeather-normalized Electric 2015 Sales Growth (Decline)\n \u2022 PSCo's residential growth was primarily the result of customer additions, partially offset by lower use per customer. C&I decline was primarily due to reduced sales to certain large manufacturing customers and/or those that support the fracking industry. \n \u2022 NSP-Minnesota's residential decrease was due to lower use per customer, partially offset by an increase in customer additions. C&I electric sales decreased as a result of lower use by large and small customers (e.g., services, retail trade, finance insurance and real estate industries), partially offset by higher use by certain large customers in the petroleum and food processing industries. The decline was partially reduced by an increase in the number of customers in both the small and large classes. \n \u2022 SPS' residential growth reflects an increased number of customers. C&I also had an increase in customers, primarily in the oil and gas exploration and production industries. However, this was partially offset by reduced activity per customer within these industries, as well as less irrigation by agricultural customers due to wet weather. \n \u2022 NSP-Wisconsin's residential decline was primarily attributable to lower use per customer, partially offset by customer additions. C&I electric sales growth was largely due to strong sales to large customers primarily in the oil and gas industries. \nWeather-normalized Natural Gas 2015 Sales Decline\n \u2022 Across natural gas service territories, lower natural gas sales reflect a decline in customer use. \nElectric Revenues and Margin\nElectric revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses are largely impacted by the fluctuation in the price of natural gas, coal and uranium used in the generation of electricity, but as a result of the design of fuel recovery mechanisms to recover current expenses, these price fluctuations have minimal impact on electric margin. The following table details the electric revenues and margin:\n\nThe following tables summarize the components of the changes in electric revenues and electric margin for the years ended Dec. 31:\nElectric Revenues\n\n2016 Comparison with 2015 - Electric revenues increased primarily due to various rate increases at NSP-Minnesota (net of estimated provision for refund), NSP-Wisconsin and SPS.\nElectric Margin\n\n(a) Increase is primarily due to interim rates in Minnesota (net of estimated provision for refund) and final rates in Wisconsin and New Mexico.\n2016 Comparison to 2015 - The increase in electric margin was primarily due to the various rate increases at NSP-Minnesota (net of estimated provision for refund), NSP-Wisconsin and SPS as well as the non-fuel riders.\nElectric Revenues\n\n2015 Comparison with 2014 - Electric revenues decreased primarily due to lower fuel and purchased power cost recovery, which is offset in operating expense. This decrease was partially offset by various rate increases at NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin and SPS as well as the non-fuel rider in Colorado.\nElectric Margin\n\n(a) Increase due to rate proceedings in Minnesota, South Dakota, Texas, North Dakota, New Mexico and Wisconsin. These increases were partially offset by a decline in Colorado retail base rates, which was more than offset by increased CACJA rider revenue as approved by the CPUC in the first quarter of 2015.\n(b) Primarily related to the Transmission Cost Recovery rider in Minnesota.\n2015 Comparison to 2014 - The increase in electric margin was primarily due to the various rate increases at NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin and SPS as well as the non-fuel rider in Colorado.\nNatural Gas Revenues and Margin\nTotal natural gas expense tends to vary with changing sales requirements and the cost of natural gas purchases. Due to the design of purchased natural gas cost recovery mechanisms for sales to retail customers, fluctuations in the cost of natural gas has minimal impact on natural gas margin. The following table details natural gas revenues and margin:\n\nThe following tables summarize the components of the changes in natural gas revenues and natural gas margin for the years ended Dec. 31:\nNatural Gas Revenues\n\n2016 Comparison to 2015 - Natural gas revenues decreased primarily due to the purchased natural gas adjustment clause recovery, which is offset in operating expense.\nNatural Gas Margin\n\n (a) Increase is primarily related to final natural gas rates in Colorado. \n2016 Comparison to 2015 - The increase in natural gas margins was primarily due to the rate increase in Colorado.\nNatural Gas Revenues\n\n2015 Comparison to 2014 - Natural gas revenues decreased primarily due to the purchased natural gas adjustment clause recovery, which is offset in operating expense.\nNatural Gas Margin\n\n2015 Comparison to 2014 - Natural gas margins decreased primarily due to warmer winter weather and lower gas recovery rates primarily in NSP-Minnesota and PSCo.\nNon-Fuel Operating Expenses and Other Items\nO&M Expenses - O&M expenses decreased $3.1 million, or 0.1 percent, for 2016 compared with 2015.\nO&M expenses decreased $4.7 million, or 0.2 percent for 2015 compared with 2014. The decline was primarily related to a reduction in nuclear expense driven by operational efficiencies and lower amortization of prior outages, which were partially offset by an increase in labor and contract labor as a result of various projects and initiatives to improve business processes.\nConservation and DSM Program Expenses - Conservation and DSM program expenses increased $20.1 million, or 8.9 percent, for 2016 compared with 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to more customer participation in DSM programs. Higher conservation and DSM program expenses are generally offset by higher revenues due to recovery mechanisms.\nConservation and DSM program expenses decreased $77.1 million, or 25.5 percent, for 2015 compared with 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower electric and gas recovery rates at NSP-Minnesota and PSCo.\nDepreciation and Amortization - Depreciation and amortization increased $178.7 million, or 15.9 percent, for 2016 compared with 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to capital investments, including Pleasant Valley and Border Wind Farms, reduction of the excess depreciation reserve in Minnesota and recognition of the DOE settlement credits in 2015.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $105.5 million, or 10.4 percent, for 2015 compared with 2014. The increase was primarily attributed to capital investments and lower amortization of the excess depreciation reserve in Minnesota, partially offset by Minnesota's amortization of the DOE settlement.\nTaxes (Other Than Income Taxes) - Taxes (other than income taxes) increased $20.4 million, or 4.0 percent, for 2016 compared with 2015. The increase was primarily due to higher property taxes in Minnesota, excluding the impact of the proposed tax deferral in the settlement agreement in the Minnesota 2016 multi-year electric rate case.\nTaxes (other than income taxes) increased $45.8 million, or 9.8 percent, for 2015 compared with 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher property taxes in Colorado, Minnesota and Texas.\nAFUDC, Equity and Debt - AFUDC increased $5.4 million for 2016 compared with 2015. The increase was primarily due to the expansion of transmission facilities and other capital expenditures.\nAFUDC decreased $46.0 million for 2015 compared with 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the implementation of the CACJA rider, facilitating earlier and alternative recovery of construction costs.\nInterest Charges - Interest charges increased $51.6 million, or 8.7 percent, for 2016 compared with 2015. The increase was related to higher long-term debt levels to fund capital investments, partially offset by refinancings at lower interest rates.\nInterest charges increased $28.7 million, or 5.1 percent, for 2015 compared with 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher long-term debt levels, partially offset by refinancings at lower interest rates.\nIncome Taxes - Income tax expense increased $38.5 million for 2016 compared with 2015. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to higher pretax earnings in 2016, partially offset by increased wind PTCs in 2016. The ETR was 34.1 percent for 2016 compared with 35.5 percent for 2015. The lower ETR in 2016 is primarily due to the wind PTCs in 2016. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nIncome tax expense increased $18.9 million for 2015 compared with 2014. The increase was primarily due to a higher tax benefit for a carryback claim in 2014 and decrease in permanent plant-related deductions (e.g., AFUDC-equity) in 2015. The ETR was 35.5 percent for 2015 compared with 33.9 percent for 2014. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nXcel Energy Inc. and Other Results\nThe following tables summarize the net income and EPS contributions of Xcel Energy Inc. and its nonregulated businesses:\n\n\n (a) Amounts include gains or losses associated with sales of properties held by Eloigne. \nXcel Energy Inc.'s results include interest charges, which are incurred at Xcel Energy Inc. and are not directly assigned to individual subsidiaries.\nFactors Affecting Results of Operations\nXcel Energy's utility revenues depend on customer usage, which varies with weather conditions, general business conditions and the cost of energy services. Various regulatory agencies approve the prices for electric and natural gas service within their respective jurisdictions and affect Xcel Energy's ability to recover its costs from customers. The historical and future trends of Xcel Energy's operating results have been, and are expected to be, affected by a number of factors, including those listed below.\nGeneral Economic Conditions\nEconomic conditions may have a material impact on Xcel Energy's operating results. While economic growth has been improving over the past year, management cannot predict whether this trend will be sustained going forward. Other events impact overall economic conditions and management cannot predict the impact of fluctuating energy prices, terrorist activity, war or the threat of war. However, Xcel Energy could experience a material impact to its results of operations, future growth or ability to raise capital resulting from a sustained general slowdown in economic growth or a significant increase in interest rates.\nFuel Supply and Costs\nXcel Energy Inc.'s operating utilities have varying dependence on coal, natural gas and uranium. Changes in commodity prices are generally recovered through fuel recovery mechanisms and have very little impact on earnings. However, availability of supply, the potential implementation of a carbon tax or emissions-related generation restrictions and unanticipated changes in regulatory recovery mechanisms could impact our operations. See Item 1 for further discussion of fuel supply and costs.\nPension Plan Costs and Assumptions\nXcel Energy has significant net pension and postretirement benefit costs that are measured using actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates and expected return on plan assets. Xcel Energy evaluates these key assumptions at least annually by analyzing current market conditions, which include changes in interest rates and market returns. Changes in the related net pension and postretirement benefits costs and funding requirements may occur in the future due to changes in assumptions. The payout of a significant percentage of pension plan liabilities in a single year due to high retirements or employees leaving Xcel Energy would trigger settlement accounting and could require Xcel Energy to recognize material incremental pension expense related to unrecognized plan losses in the year these liabilities are paid. For further discussion and a sensitivity analysis on these assumptions, see Employee Benefits\u201d under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\nTax Reform\nTax reform is a key component of the pro-growth agenda of the new Congress and the Trump Administration. Xcel Energy believes it is early in the process and will continue to evolve. Xcel Energy has initially analyzed two potential tax-reform scenarios and their potential impact. Both scenarios assume a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 20 percent in 2018, with the first scenario maintaining interest deductibility and not including 100 percent capital expensing, and the second scenario providing for 100 percent capital expensing and no deductibility of interest expense.\nThe impact under the first scenario could be mildly accretive to Xcel Energy's earnings in 2021, due to a reduction in the deferred tax liability over time. The impact under the second scenario would be modestly dilutive to Xcel Energy's earnings in 2021, due to the loss of interest deductibility and lower rate base.\nXcel Energy believes that the industry and its customers are negatively impacted by the loss of interest deductibility. Accordingly, Xcel Energy will continue to work vigorously to advance the interests of customers and the industry.\nRegulation\nFERC and State Regulation - The FERC and various state and local regulatory commissions regulate Xcel Energy Inc.'s utility subsidiaries, TransCo subsidiaries and WGI. Decisions by these regulators can significantly impact Xcel Energy's results of operations. Xcel Energy expects to periodically file for rate changes based on changing operating costs, new or planned investments, fluctuations in energy markets and general economic conditions.\nThe electric and natural gas rates charged to customers of Xcel Energy Inc.'s utility subsidiaries are approved by the FERC or the regulatory commissions in the states in which they operate. The rates are designed to recover plant investment, operating costs and an allowed return on investment. Rates charged by Xcel Energy Inc.'s TransCo subsidiaries and WGI are approved by the FERC. Xcel Energy requests changes in rates for utility services through filings with the governing commissions. Changes in operating costs can affect Xcel Energy's financial results, depending on the timing of filing general rate cases and the implementation of final rates. In addition to changes in operating costs, other factors affecting rate filings are new investments, sales, conservation and DSM efforts, and the cost of capital. In addition, the regulatory commissions authorize the ROE, capital structure and depreciation rates in rate proceedings.\nWholesale Energy Market Regulation - Wholesale energy markets in the Midwest and South Central U.S. are operated by MISO and SPP, respectively, to centrally dispatch all regional electric generation and apply a regional transmission congestion management system. NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin are members of MISO and SPS is a member of SPP. NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin and SPS expect to recover energy charges through either base rates or various recovery mechanisms. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nCapital Expenditure Regulation - Xcel Energy Inc.'s utility subsidiaries make substantial investments in plant additions to build and upgrade power plants, and expand and maintain the reliability of the energy transmission and distribution systems. In addition to filings for increases in base rates charged to customers to recover the costs associated with such investments, the CPUC, MPUC, SDPUC, NDPSC and PUCT in certain instances have approved proposals to recover, through a rate rider, costs to upgrade generation plants and lower emissions, increased transmission investment costs, increased distribution investment costs, and increased purchased power capacity costs. These non-fuel rate riders are expected to provide cash flows to enable recovery of costs incurred on a more timely basis. For wholesale electric transmission and production services, Xcel Energy has, consistent with FERC policy, implemented formula rates for each of the utility subsidiaries that will provide annual rate changes as transmission or production investments increase in a manner similar to the retail rate riders. In November 2014, the FERC approved transmission formula rates for XETD and XEST, which would apply to electric transmission assets the TransCos may own. NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin have no cost-based wholesale production customers and therefore have not implemented a production formula rate.\nEnvironmental Matters\nEnvironmental costs include accruals for nuclear plant decommissioning and payments for storage of spent nuclear fuel, disposal of hazardous materials and waste, remediation of contaminated sites, monitoring of discharges to the environment and compliance with laws and permits with respect to emissions. A trend of greater environmental awareness and increasingly stringent regulation may continue to cause higher operating expenses and capital expenditures for environmental compliance.\nCosts charged to operating expenses for nuclear decommissioning and spent nuclear fuel disposal expenses, environmental monitoring and disposal of hazardous materials and waste were approximately:\n \u2022 $304 million in 2016; \n \u2022 $292 million in 2015; and \n \u2022 $292 million in 2014. \nXcel Energy estimates an average annual expense of approximately $354 million from 2017 through 2021 for similar costs. The precise timing and amount of environmental costs, including those for site remediation and disposal of hazardous materials, are unknown. Additionally, the extent to which environmental costs will be included in and recovered through rates may fluctuate.\nCapital expenditures for environmental improvements at regulated facilities were approximately:\n \u2022 $93 million in 2016; \n \u2022 $184 million in 2015; and \n \u2022 $373 million in 2014. \nSee Item 7 - Capital Requirements for further discussion.\nXcel Energy's operations are subject to federal and state laws and regulations related to air emissions, water discharges and waste management from various sources. Such laws and regulations impose monitoring and reporting requirements and may require Xcel Energy to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of projects that increase air emissions, water discharges or land disposal of wastes, obtain and comply with permits that contain emission, discharge and operational limitations, or install or operate pollution control equipment at facilities. Xcel Energy will likely be required to incur capital expenditures in the future to comply with these requirements for remediation of MGP and other legacy sites and various regulations for air emissions, water intake and discharge and waste disposal. Actual expenditures could vary from the estimates presented. The scope and timing of these expenditures cannot be determined until any new or revised regulations become final or until more information is learned about the need for remediation at the legacy sites.\nPollution control equipment can be required by federal and state regulations, such as those requiring mercury emission reductions, and by state or federal implementation plans, such as those to address visibility impairment, interstate air pollution impacts or attainment of NAAQS. Xcel Energy has installed and is operating control equipment needed to comply with the requirements of the federal Mercury and Air Toxic Standards Rule. In 2016, the EPA adopted a federal visibility plan for Texas which imposes SO2 emission limitations that reflect installation of dry scrubbers on Tolk Units 1 and 2, with compliance required by early 2021. This rule has been stayed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (Fifth Circuit) until it reaches a decision on the merits of the rule.\nSee Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of Xcel Energy's environmental contingencies.\nInflation\nInflation at its current level is not expected to materially affect Xcel Energy's prices or returns to shareholders. However, potential future inflation could result from economic conditions or the economic and monetary policies of the U.S. Government and the Federal Reserve. This could lead to future price increases for materials and services required to deliver electric and natural gas services to customers. These potential cost increases could in turn lead to increased prices to customers. Likewise, lower oil prices lead to sustained deflation, that could also reduce general economic activity although it may lead to lower electric and natural gas prices to customers. Additionally, under statute, federal agencies such as FERC now can adjust statutory penalties for inflation.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nPreparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments could materially impact the consolidated financial statements and disclosures, based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment also may have a significant effect on the operation of the business and on the results reported. The following is a list of accounting policies and estimates that are most significant to the portrayal of Xcel Energy's financial condition and results, and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Each of these has a higher likelihood of resulting in materially different reported amounts under different conditions or using different assumptions. Each critical accounting policy has been reviewed and discussed with the Audit Committee of Xcel Energy Inc.'s Board of Directors on a quarterly basis.\nRegulatory Accounting\nXcel Energy Inc. is a holding company with rate-regulated subsidiaries that are subject to the accounting for Regulated Operations, which provides that rate-regulated entities report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates, if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates will be charged and collected. Xcel Energy's rates are derived through the ratemaking process, which results in the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities based on the probability of future cash flows. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred or accrued costs that have been deferred because future recovery from customers is probable. Regulatory liabilities generally represent amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers in future rates or amounts collected in current rates for future costs. In other businesses or industries, regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities would generally be charged to net income or OCI.\nEach reporting period Xcel Energy assesses the probability of future recoveries and obligations associated with regulatory assets and liabilities. Factors such as the current regulatory environment, recently issued rate orders and historical precedents are considered. Decisions made by regulatory agencies can directly impact the amount and timing of cost recovery as well as the rate of return on invested capital, and may materially impact Xcel Energy's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nAs of Dec. 31, 2016 and 2015, Xcel Energy has recorded regulatory assets of $3.4 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively and regulatory liabilities of $1.6 billion, for both periods. Each subsidiary is subject to regulation that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. If future recovery of costs, in any such jurisdiction, ceases to be probable, Xcel Energy would be required to charge these assets to current net income or OCI. In assessing the probability of recovery of recognized regulatory assets, Xcel Energy noted no current or anticipated proposals or changes in the regulatory environment that it expects will materially impact the probability", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nBusiness Segments and Organizational Overview\nXcel Energy Inc. is a public utility holding company. Xcel Energy's operations included the activity of four utility subsidiaries that serve electric and natural gas customers in eight states. These utility subsidiaries are NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin, PSCo and SPS. These utilities serve customers in portions of Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin. Along with the TransCo subsidiaries, WYCO, a joint venture formed with CIG to develop and lease natural gas pipelines, storage and compression facilities, and WGI, an interstate natural gas pipeline company, these companies comprise the regulated utility operations.\nXcel Energy Inc.'s nonregulated subsidiaries are Eloigne and Capital Services. Eloigne invests in rental housing projects that qualify for low-income housing tax credits, and Capital Services procures equipment for construction of renewable generation facilities at other subsidiaries.\nForward-Looking Statements\nExcept for the historical statements contained in this report, the matters discussed herein are forward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Such forward-looking statements, including the 2017 EPS guidance and assumptions, are intended to be identified in this document by the words anticipate,\u201d believe,\u201d estimate,\u201d expect,\u201d intend,\u201d may,\u201d objective,\u201d outlook,\u201d plan,\u201d project,\u201d possible,\u201d potential,\u201d should\u201d and similar expressions. Actual results may vary materially. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we expressly disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking information. The following factors, in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2016 (including the items described under Factors Affecting Results of Operations; and the other risk factors listed from time to time by Xcel Energy Inc. in reports filed with the SEC, including Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Exhibit 99.01 hereto), could cause actual results to differ materially from management expectations as suggested by such forward-looking information: general economic conditions, including inflation rates, monetary fluctuations and their impact on capital expenditures and the ability of Xcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries to obtain financing on favorable terms; business conditions in the energy industry, including the risk of a slow down in the U.S. economy or delay in growth, recovery, trade, fiscal, taxation and environmental policies in areas where Xcel Energy has a financial interest; customer business conditions; actions of credit rating agencies; competitive factors including the extent and timing of the entry of additional competition in the markets served by Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries; unusual weather; effects of geopolitical events, including war and acts of terrorism; cyber security threats and data security breaches; state, federal and foreign legislative and regulatory initiatives that affect cost and investment recovery, have an impact on rates or have an impact on asset operation or ownership or impose environmental compliance conditions; structures that affect the speed and degree to which competition enters the electric and natural gas markets; costs and other effects of legal and administrative proceedings, settlements, investigations and claims; financial or regulatory accounting policies imposed by regulatory bodies; outcomes of regulatory proceedings; availability of cost of capital; and employee work force factors.\nManagement's Strategic Priorities\nXcel Energy strives to provide our investors an attractive value proposition and our customers with safe, clean and reliable energy services at a competitive price. This mission is enabled via five key strategic priorities:\n \u2022 Invest in infrastructure; \n \u2022 Improve the customer experience; \n \u2022 Advance the regulatory framework and performance; \n \u2022 Transition the power generation fleet; and \n \u2022 Provide a competitive total return to investors and maintain strong investment grade credit ratings. \nBelow is a discussion of these objectives.\nInvest in infrastructure\nSound investments today are necessary for tomorrow's success. Our capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $18.4 billion from 2017 through 2021. This capital investment profile will grow our consolidated rate base at a compounded average annual rate of approximately 5.5 percent. Our capital plan includes investments in renewables, transmission, distribution, electric generation, natural gas and other parts of our utility business. Our plan includes approximately $1.3 billion of investment for grid modernization to improve the customer experience, enhance grid reliability and enable new and innovative programs and rate structures. In addition, we plan to invest $2.2 billion in gas infrastructure to enhance safety, reliability and operational performance for the benefit of our customers and communities.\nImprove the customer experience\nThe utility landscape is changing, and we must continue to thoughtfully anticipate and address the future needs of our stakeholders, including our customers, policymakers, employees and shareholders. Adapting to this changing environment is critical to our long-term success. Our customers expect to have choices, and we are committed to providing options and solutions that they want and value at a competitive price. Our continued investment in clean energy is an example of this commitment to our customers. Environmental stewardship remains foundational to Xcel Energy and is designed to meet customer and policy maker expectations while creating shareholder value. We will continue to offer and expand our production of renewable energy, including wind and solar alternatives, and further develop and promote DSM, conservation and renewable programs.\nAdvance the regulatory framework and performance\nXcel Energy is a holding company comprised primarily of several utility operating companies. As part of the regulatory process, each state will generally establish an authorized ROE. In many states, our utility operating companies earn less than the authorized ROE due to numerous factors including the timing of implementation of new rates, timing of capital investments, a regulatory commission not allowing the recovery of certain costs, the time period used as a test year for rate cases, fluctuations in sales, the impact of weather, unanticipated cost increases, etc. The difference between the authorized ROE and the earned ROE is referred to as an ROE gap. Xcel Energy is focused on reducing this gap.\nWe continue to pursue regulatory and legislative changes to streamline rate case proceedings and optimize recovery, while improving our alignment with state policies and keeping pace with evolving customer preferences.\nIn addition, keeping our costs competitive is also essential in terms of customer affordability and improving ROE over time. Xcel Energy is working to keep O&M expense relatively flat without compromising reliability or safety. We intend to accomplish this objective by continually improving our processes, leveraging technology, proactively managing risk and maintaining a workforce that is prepared to meet the needs of our business today and tomorrow.\nTransition the power generation fleet\nFor more than a decade, we have managed the risk of climate change through a clean energy strategy that consistently reduces carbon emissions and transitions our operations for the future. We continue to provide shareholder value while transforming how we produce, deliver and encourage the efficient use of energy through four primary mechanisms:\n \u2022 Increasing the use of renewable energy; \n \u2022 Offering energy efficiency programs for customers; \n \u2022 Retiring or repowering coals units and modernizing our generating plants; and \n \u2022 Advancing power grid capabilities. \nOur service territories benefit from the geographic concentration of favorable renewable resources. Strong wind and high solar irradiance yield high generation capacity factors and consequently lowers the cost of these resources.\nThe combination of high capacity factors, a strong transmission network, improved supply chain, technological improvements and the extension of the renewable tax credits translates into low renewable energy costs for our customers. As a result, we have a beneficial opportunity to invest in renewable generation, in which the capital costs are largely or completely offset by fuel savings. This provides us the opportunity to lower the emission profile of our generation fleet, grow our renewable portfolio and provide significant fuel savings to our customers.\nOur capital forecast for 2017-2021 includes $3.5 billion of investment in renewable generation. This includes the following projects:\n \u2022 The 600 MW Rush Creek wind project in Colorado, which was approved by the CPUC in 2016; \n \u2022 A proposal to build and own 750 MW of new wind generation at NSP-Minnesota. This project is pending MPUC approval; and \n \u2022 Plans to spend an additional $1.5 billion on other renewable projects in our various states. This could include our preliminary plans to add 500-1,000 MW of wind generation at SPS. \nEmission reductions are an important driver of our strategy. Since 2005, we have reduced carbon emissions 30 percent and are projected to achieve an approximate 43 percent reduction by 2021.\nProvide a competitive total return to investors and maintain strong investment grade credit\nSuccessful execution of our strategic objectives should allow Xcel Energy to continue to deliver a competitive total return for our shareholders. Through our disciplined approach to business growth, financial investment, operations and safety, we plan to:\n \u2022 Deliver long-term annual EPS growth of four percent to six percent; \n \u2022 Deliver annual dividend increases of five percent to seven percent; \n \u2022 Target a dividend payout ratio of 60 to 70 percent of annual ongoing EPS; and \n \u2022 Maintain senior unsecured debt credit ratings in the BBB+ to A range. \nWe have successfully achieved our prior financial objectives, meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance range for twelve consecutive years and believe we are positioned to continue to deliver on our value proposition. Our ongoing earnings have grown approximately 6.1 percent and our dividend has grown approximately 4.3 percent annually from 2005 through 2016. In addition, our current senior unsecured debt credit ratings for Xcel Energy and its utility subsidiaries are in the BBB+ to A range.\nFinancial Review\nThe following discussion and analysis by management focuses on those factors that had a material effect on Xcel Energy's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows during the periods presented, or are expected to have a material impact in the future. It should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the related notes to consolidated financial statements.\nThe only common equity securities that are publicly traded are common shares of Xcel Energy Inc. The diluted earnings and EPS of each subsidiary as well as the ROE of each subsidiary discussed below do not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities allocated to such subsidiary but rather represent a direct interest in our assets and liabilities as a whole. Ongoing diluted EPS and ongoing ROE for Xcel Energy and by subsidiary are financial measures not recognized under GAAP. Ongoing diluted EPS is calculated by dividing the net income or loss attributable to the controlling interest of each subsidiary, adjusted for certain nonrecurring items, by the weighted average fully diluted Xcel Energy Inc. common shares outstanding for the period. Ongoing ROE is calculated by dividing the net income or loss attributable to the controlling interest of Xcel Energy or each subsidiary, adjusted for certain nonrecurring items, by each entity's average common stockholders' or stockholder's equity. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and provide details of earnings results. We believe these measurements are useful to investors to evaluate the actual and projected financial performance and contribution of our subsidiaries. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes the diluted EPS for Xcel Energy:\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NSP-Minnesota\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.96\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PSCo\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.92\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.90\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SPS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NSP-Wisconsin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regulated utility (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Xcel Energy Inc. and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ongoing diluted EPS (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.03\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on Monticello LCM/EPU project\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.16\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP diluted EPS (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.94\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.03\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Amounts may not add due to rounding. \nOngoing earnings for 2015 excludes an adjustment related to the Monticello nuclear facility LCM/EPU project. See below as well as Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nXcel Energy's management believes that ongoing earnings provide a meaningful comparison of earnings results and is representative of Xcel Energy's fundamental core earnings power. Xcel Energy's management uses ongoing earnings internally for financial planning and analysis, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors, in determining whether performance targets are met for performance-based compensation and when communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors.\n2015 Adjustment to GAAP Earnings\nLoss on Monticello LCM/EPU Project - In March 2015, the MPUC approved full recovery, including a return, on $415 million of the project costs, inclusive of AFUDC, but only allowed recovery of the remaining $333 million of costs with no return on this portion of the investment for 2015 and beyond. As a result of this decision, Xcel Energy recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $129 million, or $79 million net of tax, in the first quarter of 2015. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nEarnings Adjusted for Certain Items\n2016 Comparison with 2015\nXcel Energy - 2016 GAAP earnings increased due to the 2015 loss on Monticello LCM/EPU project, see Note 12 for further information. In addition, GAAP and ongoing earnings increased $0.12 per share. Increases in electric and natural gas margins were primarily driven by higher rates and riders across various jurisdictions to recover our capital investments and the favorable impact of weather as compared with the previous year. These positive factors and a lower ETR were partially offset by higher depreciation, interest charges and property taxes.\nNSP-Minnesota - 2016 GAAP earnings increased due to the 2015 loss on Monticello LCM/EPU project, see Note 12 for further information. In addition, GAAP and ongoing earnings increased $0.11 per share due to the following: higher electric margins primarily driven by an interim electric rate increase in Minnesota (net of estimated provision for refund); non-fuel riders; the favorable impact of weather; and a lower ETR. These positive factors were partially offset by higher depreciation, O&M expenses, interest charges and property taxes\nPSCo - Earnings decreased $0.01 per share for 2016. The positive impact of higher natural gas margins (primarily due to a rate increase), sales growth and a lower estimated electric earnings test refund, were more than offset by increased depreciation and interest charges.\nSPS - Earnings increased $0.05 per share for 2016. Higher electric margins and lower O&M expenses were partially offset by an increase in depreciation and interest charges.\nNSP-Wisconsin - Earnings decreased $0.01 per share for 2016. The positive impact of higher electric margins (primarily driven by an electric rate increase) was more than offset by higher O&M expenses and depreciation.\nEquity earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries - Earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries increased $0.01 per share in 2016 due to facility expansion and increased sales at WYCO.\nXcel Energy Inc. and other - Xcel Energy Inc. and other includes financing costs at the holding company and other items.\nThe decrease in earnings was primarily related to higher long-term debt levels.\n2015 Comparison with 2014\nXcel Energy - Twelve month year-over-year GAAP earnings decreased due to the 2015 loss on Monticello LCM/EPU project, refer to Note 12 for further information. Ongoing earnings increased $0.06 per share for 2015 primarily due to rate increases in various jurisdictions, non-fuel riders, a lower earnings test refund in Colorado and a decline in O&M expenses. These positive factors were partially offset by the impact of negative weather as well as higher depreciation, property taxes, interest charges and lower AFUDC.\nNSP-Minnesota - Twelve month year-over-year GAAP earnings decreased due to the 2015 loss on Monticello LCM/EPU project, refer to Note 12 for further information. Ongoing earnings increased $0.05 per share for 2015 and were positively impacted by electric rate increases in Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota, and lower O&M expenses. These positive factors were partially offset by unfavorable weather, sales decline, higher depreciation, increased interest charges, property taxes and lower AFUDC.\nPSCo - Earnings increased $0.02 per share for 2015. Higher revenue primarily due to the CACJA rider (partially offset by an electric base rate decrease), as well as a natural gas rate increase, effective in October 2015, lower estimated electric earnings test refunds and the positive impact of weather. These positive factors were partially offset by higher property taxes, depreciation, O&M expenses, interest charges and lower AFUDC.\nSPS - Earnings decreased $0.01 per share for 2015. Although Texas electric rates rose as a result of the prior year rate case, this was reduced by the negative impact of the 2015 case. The net increase in electric rates was more than offset by additional depreciation, higher O&M expenses and lower AFUDC.\nNSP-Wisconsin - Earnings increased $0.01 per share for 2015. Higher electric revenues primarily driven by an electric rate increase and lower O&M expenses were partially offset by higher depreciation and lower natural gas margins.\nChanges in Diluted EPS\nThe following table summarizes significant components contributing to the changes in 2016 EPS compared with the same period in 2015:\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dec. 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015 GAAP diluted EPS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.94\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on Monticello LCM/EPU project\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015 ongoing diluted EPS (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of change -

Unusually hot summers or cold winters increase electric and natural gas sales, while mild weather reduces electric and natural gas sales. The estimated impact of weather on earnings is based on the number of customers, temperature variances and the amount of natural gas or electricity the average customer historically uses per degree of temperature. Accordingly, deviations in weather from normal levels can affect Xcel Energy's financial performance.\nDegree-day or Temperature-Humidity Index (THI) data is used to estimate amounts of energy required to maintain comfortable indoor temperature levels based on each day's average temperature and humidity. Heating degree-days (HDD) is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature falls below 65\u00b0 Fahrenheit. Cooling degree-days (CDD) is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature rises above 65\u00b0 Fahrenheit. Each degree of temperature above 65\u00b0 Fahrenheit is counted as one CDD, and each degree of temperature below 65\u00b0 Fahrenheit is counted as one HDD. In Xcel Energy's more humid service territories, a THI is used in place of CDD, which adds a humidity factor to CDD. HDD, CDD and THI are most likely to impact the usage of Xcel Energy's residential and commercial customers. Industrial customers are less sensitive to weather.\nNormal weather conditions are defined as either the 20-year or 30-year average of actual historical weather conditions. The historical period of time used in the calculation of normal weather differs by jurisdiction, based on regulatory practice. To calculate the impact of weather on demand, a demand factor is applied to the weather impact on sales as defined above to derive the amount of demand associated with the weather impact.\nThe percentage increase (decrease) in normal and actual HDD, CDD and THI are provided in the following table:\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs.\nNormal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs.\nNormal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014 vs.\nNormal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HDD\n</td> <td>(13.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CDD\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>THI\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWeather -

The estimated impact of the additional day of sales in 2016 was approximately 20-40 basis points for retail electric and 50 basis points for firm natural gas for the twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2016. \nWeather-normalized Electric 2016 Sales Growth (Decline) - Excluding Leap Day\n \u2022 NSP-Minnesota's residential sales decreased as a result of lower use per customer, partially offset by customer additions. C&I sales declined primarily as a result of lower use by customers in the manufacturing and service industries. \n \u2022 PSCo's residential growth reflects an increased number of customers. The C&I decline was mainly due to lower sales to certain large customers in the manufacturing, mining, oil and gas industries. The decline was partially offset by an increase in the number of small C&I customers. \n \u2022 SPS' residential sales decline was primarily the result of lower use per customer, partially offset by an increased number of customers. The increase in C&I sales was driven by energy sector expansion in the Southeastern New Mexico, Permian Basin area as well as greater use by agricultural customers. \n \u2022 NSP-Wisconsin's residential sales decrease was primarily attributable to lower use per customer, partially offset by customer additions. The C&I decline was largely due to reduced sales to small customers. The overall decrease was partially offset by an increase in the number of C&I customers as well as greater use in the large C&I class for the oil and gas industries. \nWeather-normalized Natural Gas 2016 Sales Decline - Excluding Leap Day\n \u2022 Across natural gas service territories, lower natural gas sales reflect a decline in customer use, partially offset by a slight increase in the number of customers. \nWeather-normalized sales for 2017 are projected to increase approximately 0 percent to 0.5 percent for retail electric and firm natural gas customers, respectively.\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NSP-Minnesota\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>PSCo\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SPS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NSP-Wisconsin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Xcel Energy\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Actual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electric residential (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electric C&I\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total retail electric sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Firm natural gas sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NSP-Minnesota\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>PSCo\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SPS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NSP-Wisconsin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Xcel Energy\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weather-normalized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electric residential (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electric C&I\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total retail electric sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Firm natural gas sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a) Extreme weather variations and additional factors such as windchill and cloud cover may not be reflected in weather-normalized and actual growth estimates.\nWeather-normalized Electric 2015 Sales Growth (Decline)\n \u2022 PSCo's residential growth was primarily the result of customer additions, partially offset by lower use per customer. C&I decline was primarily due to reduced sales to certain large manufacturing customers and/or those that support the fracking industry. \n \u2022 NSP-Minnesota's residential decrease was due to lower use per customer, partially offset by an increase in customer additions. C&I electric sales decreased as a result of lower use by large and small customers (e.g., services, retail trade, finance insurance and real estate industries), partially offset by higher use by certain large customers in the petroleum and food processing industries. The decline was partially reduced by an increase in the number of customers in both the small and large classes. \n \u2022 SPS' residential growth reflects an increased number of customers. C&I also had an increase in customers, primarily in the oil and gas exploration and production industries. However, this was partially offset by reduced activity per customer within these industries, as well as less irrigation by agricultural customers due to wet weather. \n \u2022 NSP-Wisconsin's residential decline was primarily attributable to lower use per customer, partially offset by customer additions. C&I electric sales growth was largely due to strong sales to large customers primarily in the oil and gas industries. \nWeather-normalized Natural Gas 2015 Sales Decline\n \u2022 Across natural gas service territories, lower natural gas sales reflect a decline in customer use. \nElectric Revenues and Margin\nElectric revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses are largely impacted by the fluctuation in the price of natural gas, coal and uranium used in the generation of electricity, but as a result of the design of fuel recovery mechanisms to recover current expenses, these price fluctuations have minimal impact on electric margin. The following table details the electric revenues and margin:\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Millions of Dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electric revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electric fuel and purchased power\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,718\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,763\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,210\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electric margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following tables summarize the components of the changes in electric revenues and electric margin for the years ended Dec. 31:\nElectric Revenues\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Millions of Dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail rate increases (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>190\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transmission revenue, net of costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trading\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-fuel riders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated impact of weather, excluding decoupling in Minnesota\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fuel and purchased power cost recovery\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(127\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total increase in electric revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>224\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 Comparison with 2015 -

Natural gas margins decreased primarily due to warmer winter weather and lower gas recovery rates primarily in NSP-Minnesota and PSCo.\nNon-Fuel Operating Expenses and Other Items\nO&M Expenses - O&M expenses decreased $3.1 million, or 0.1 percent, for 2016 compared with 2015.\nO&M expenses decreased $4.7 million, or 0.2 percent for 2015 compared with 2014. The decline was primarily related to a reduction in nuclear expense driven by operational efficiencies and lower amortization of prior outages, which were partially offset by an increase in labor and contract labor as a result of various projects and initiatives to improve business processes.\nConservation and DSM Program Expenses - Conservation and DSM program expenses increased $20.1 million, or 8.9 percent, for 2016 compared with 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to more customer participation in DSM programs. Higher conservation and DSM program expenses are generally offset by higher revenues due to recovery mechanisms.\nConservation and DSM program expenses decreased $77.1 million, or 25.5 percent, for 2015 compared with 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower electric and gas recovery rates at NSP-Minnesota and PSCo.\nDepreciation and Amortization - Depreciation and amortization increased $178.7 million, or 15.9 percent, for 2016 compared with 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to capital investments, including Pleasant Valley and Border Wind Farms, reduction of the excess depreciation reserve in Minnesota and recognition of the DOE settlement credits in 2015.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $105.5 million, or 10.4 percent, for 2015 compared with 2014. The increase was primarily attributed to capital investments and lower amortization of the excess depreciation reserve in Minnesota, partially offset by Minnesota's amortization of the DOE settlement.\nTaxes (Other Than Income Taxes) - Taxes (other than income taxes) increased $20.4 million, or 4.0 percent, for 2016 compared with 2015. The increase was primarily due to higher property taxes in Minnesota, excluding the impact of the proposed tax deferral in the settlement agreement in the Minnesota 2016 multi-year electric rate case.\nTaxes (other than income taxes) increased $45.8 million, or 9.8 percent, for 2015 compared with 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher property taxes in Colorado, Minnesota and Texas.\nAFUDC, Equity and Debt - AFUDC increased $5.4 million for 2016 compared with 2015. The increase was primarily due to the expansion of transmission facilities and other capital expenditures.\nAFUDC decreased $46.0 million for 2015 compared with 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the implementation of the CACJA rider, facilitating earlier and alternative recovery of construction costs.\nInterest Charges - Interest charges increased $51.6 million, or 8.7 percent, for 2016 compared with 2015. The increase was related to higher long-term debt levels to fund capital investments, partially offset by refinancings at lower interest rates.\nInterest charges increased $28.7 million, or 5.1 percent, for 2015 compared with 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher long-term debt levels, partially offset by refinancings at lower interest rates.\nIncome Taxes - Income tax expense increased $38.5 million for 2016 compared with 2015. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to higher pretax earnings in 2016, partially offset by increased wind PTCs in 2016. The ETR was 34.1 percent for 2016 compared with 35.5 percent for 2015. The lower ETR in 2016 is primarily due to the wind PTCs in 2016. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nIncome tax expense increased $18.9 million for 2015 compared with 2014. The increase was primarily due to a higher tax benefit for a carryback claim in 2014 and decrease in permanent plant-related deductions (e.g., AFUDC-equity) in 2015. The ETR was 35.5 percent for 2015 compared with 33.9 percent for 2014.

Various regulatory agencies approve the prices for electric and natural gas service within their respective jurisdictions and affect Xcel Energy's ability to recover its costs from customers. The historical and future trends of Xcel Energy's operating results have been, and are expected to be, affected by a number of factors, including those listed below.\nGeneral Economic Conditions\nEconomic conditions may have a material impact on Xcel Energy's operating results. While economic growth has been improving over the past year, management cannot predict whether this trend will be sustained going forward. Other events impact overall economic conditions and management cannot predict the impact of fluctuating energy prices, terrorist activity, war or the threat of war. However, Xcel Energy could experience a material impact to its results of operations, future growth or ability to raise capital resulting from a sustained general slowdown in economic growth or a significant increase in interest rates.\nFuel Supply and Costs\nXcel Energy Inc.'s operating utilities have varying dependence on coal, natural gas and uranium. Changes in commodity prices are generally recovered through fuel recovery mechanisms and have very little impact on earnings. However, availability of supply, the potential implementation of a carbon tax or emissions-related generation restrictions and unanticipated changes in regulatory recovery mechanisms could impact our operations. See Item 1 for further discussion of fuel supply and costs.\nPension Plan Costs and Assumptions\nXcel Energy has significant net pension and postretirement benefit costs that are measured using actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates and expected return on plan assets. Xcel Energy evaluates these key assumptions at least annually by analyzing current market conditions, which include changes in interest rates and market returns. Changes in the related net pension and postretirement benefits costs and funding requirements may occur in the future due to changes in assumptions. The payout of a significant percentage of pension plan liabilities in a single year due to high retirements or employees leaving Xcel Energy would trigger settlement accounting and could require Xcel Energy to recognize material incremental pension expense related to unrecognized plan losses in the year these liabilities are paid. For further discussion and a sensitivity analysis on these assumptions, see Employee Benefits\u201d under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\nTax Reform\nTax reform is a key component of the pro-growth agenda of the new Congress and the Trump Administration. Xcel Energy believes it is early in the process and will continue to evolve. Xcel Energy has initially analyzed two potential tax-reform scenarios and their potential impact. Both scenarios assume a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 20 percent in 2018, with the first scenario maintaining interest deductibility and not including 100 percent capital expensing, and the second scenario providing for 100 percent capital expensing and no deductibility of interest expense.\nThe impact under the first scenario could be mildly accretive to Xcel Energy's earnings in 2021, due to a reduction in the deferred tax liability over time. The impact under the second scenario would be modestly dilutive to Xcel Energy's earnings in 2021, due to the loss of interest deductibility and lower rate base.\nXcel Energy believes that the industry and its customers are negatively impacted by the loss of interest deductibility. Accordingly, Xcel Energy will continue to work vigorously to advance the interests of customers and the industry.\nRegulation\nFERC and State Regulation - The FERC and various state and local regulatory commissions regulate Xcel Energy Inc.'s utility subsidiaries, TransCo subsidiaries and WGI. Decisions by these regulators can significantly impact Xcel Energy's results of operations. Xcel Energy expects to periodically file for rate changes based on changing operating costs, new or planned investments, fluctuations in energy markets and general economic conditions.\nThe electric and natural gas rates charged to customers of Xcel Energy Inc.'s utility subsidiaries are approved by the FERC or the regulatory commissions in the states in which they operate. The rates are designed to recover plant investment, operating costs and an allowed return on investment. Rates charged by Xcel Energy Inc.'s TransCo subsidiaries and WGI are approved by the FERC. Xcel Energy requests changes in rates for utility services through filings with the governing commissions. Changes in operating costs can affect Xcel Energy's financial results, depending on the timing of filing general rate cases and the implementation of final rates. In addition to changes in operating costs, other factors affecting rate filings are new investments, sales, conservation and DSM efforts, and the cost of capital. In addition, the regulatory commissions authorize the ROE, capital structure and depreciation rates in rate proceedings.\nWholesale Energy Market Regulation - Wholesale energy markets in the Midwest and South Central U.S. are operated by MISO and SPP, respectively, to centrally dispatch all regional electric generation and apply a regional transmission congestion management system. NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin are members of MISO and SPS is a member of SPP. NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin and SPS expect to recover energy charges through either base rates or various recovery mechanisms. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nCapital Expenditure Regulation - Xcel Energy Inc.'s utility subsidiaries make substantial investments in plant additions to build and upgrade power plants, and expand and maintain the reliability of the energy transmission and distribution systems. In addition to filings for increases in base rates charged to customers to recover the costs associated with such investments, the CPUC, MPUC, SDPUC, NDPSC and PUCT in certain instances have approved proposals to recover, through a rate rider, costs to upgrade generation plants and lower emissions, increased transmission investment costs, increased distribution investment costs, and increased purchased power capacity costs. These non-fuel rate riders are expected to provide cash flows to enable recovery of costs incurred on a more timely basis. For wholesale electric transmission and production services, Xcel Energy has, consistent with FERC policy, implemented formula rates for each of the utility subsidiaries that will provide annual rate changes as transmission or production investments increase in a manner similar to the retail rate riders. In November 2014, the FERC approved transmission formula rates for XETD and XEST, which would apply to electric transmission assets the TransCos may own. NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin have no cost-based wholesale production customers and therefore have not implemented a production formula rate.\nEnvironmental Matters\nEnvironmental costs include accruals for nuclear plant decommissioning and payments for storage of spent nuclear fuel, disposal of hazardous materials and waste, remediation of contaminated sites, monitoring of discharges to the environment and compliance with laws and permits with respect to emissions. A trend of greater environmental awareness and increasingly stringent regulation may continue to cause higher operating expenses and capital expenditures for environmental compliance.\nCosts charged to operating expenses for nuclear decommissioning and spent nuclear fuel disposal expenses, environmental monitoring and disposal of hazardous materials and waste were approximately:\n \u2022 $304 million in 2016; \n \u2022 $292 million in 2015; and \n \u2022 $292 million in 2014. \nXcel Energy estimates an average annual expense of approximately $354 million from 2017 through 2021 for similar costs. The precise timing and amount of environmental costs, including those for site remediation and disposal of hazardous materials, are unknown. Additionally, the extent to which environmental costs will be included in and recovered through rates may fluctuate.\nCapital expenditures for environmental improvements at regulated facilities were approximately:\n \u2022 $93 million in 2016; \n \u2022 $184 million in 2015; and \n \u2022 $373 million in 2014. \nSee Item 7 - Capital Requirements for further discussion.\nXcel Energy's operations are subject to federal and state laws and regulations related to air emissions, water discharges and waste management from various sources. Such laws and regulations impose monitoring and reporting requirements and may require Xcel Energy to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of projects that increase air emissions, water discharges or land disposal of wastes, obtain and comply with permits that contain emission, discharge and operational limitations, or install or operate pollution control equipment at facilities. Xcel Energy will likely be required to incur capital expenditures in the future to comply with these requirements for remediation of MGP and other legacy sites and various regulations for air emissions, water intake and discharge and waste disposal. Actual expenditures could vary from the estimates presented. The scope and timing of these expenditures cannot be determined until any new or revised regulations become final or until more information is learned about the need for remediation at the legacy sites.\nPollution control equipment can be required by federal and state regulations, such as those requiring mercury emission reductions, and by state or federal implementation plans, such as those to address visibility impairment, interstate air pollution impacts or attainment of NAAQS. Xcel Energy has installed and is operating control equipment needed to comply with the requirements of the federal Mercury and Air Toxic Standards Rule. In 2016, the EPA adopted a federal visibility plan for Texas which imposes SO2 emission limitations that reflect installation of dry scrubbers on Tolk Units 1 and 2, with compliance required by early 2021. This rule has been stayed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (Fifth Circuit) until it reaches a decision on the merits of the rule.\nSee Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of Xcel Energy's environmental contingencies.\nInflation\nInflation at its current level is not expected to materially affect Xcel Energy's prices or returns to shareholders. However, potential future inflation could result from economic conditions or the economic and monetary policies of the U.S. Government and the Federal Reserve. This could lead to future price increases for materials and services required to deliver electric and natural gas services to customers. These potential cost increases could in turn lead to increased prices to customers. Likewise, lower oil prices lead to sustained deflation, that could also reduce general economic activity although it may lead to lower electric and natural gas prices to customers. Additionally, under statute, federal agencies such as FERC now can adjust statutory penalties for inflation.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nPreparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments could materially impact the consolidated financial statements and disclosures, based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment also may have a significant effect on the operation of the business and on the results reported. The following is a list of accounting policies and estimates that are most significant to the portrayal of Xcel Energy's financial condition and results, and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Each of these has a higher likelihood of resulting in materially different reported amounts under different conditions or using different assumptions. Each critical accounting policy has been reviewed and discussed with the Audit Committee of Xcel Energy Inc.'s Board of Directors on a quarterly basis.\nRegulatory Accounting\nXcel Energy Inc. is a holding company with rate-regulated subsidiaries that are subject to the accounting for Regulated Operations, which provides that rate-regulated entities report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates, if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates will be charged and collected. Xcel Energy's rates are derived through the ratemaking process, which results in the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities based on the probability of future cash flows. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred or accrued costs that have been deferred because future recovery from customers is probable. Regulatory liabilities generally represent amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers in future rates or amounts collected in current rates for future costs. In other businesses or industries, regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities would generally be charged to net income or OCI.\nEach reporting period Xcel Energy assesses the probability of future recoveries and obligations associated with regulatory assets and liabilities. Factors such as the current regulatory environment, recently issued rate orders and historical precedents are considered. Decisions made by regulatory agencies can directly impact the amount and timing of cost recovery as well as the rate of return on invested capital, and may materially impact Xcel Energy's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nAs of Dec. 31, 2016 and 2015, Xcel Energy has recorded regulatory assets of $3.4 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively and regulatory liabilities of $1.6 billion, for both periods. Each subsidiary is subject to regulation that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. If future recovery of costs, in any such jurisdiction, ceases to be probable, Xcel Energy would be required to charge these assets to current net income or OCI. In assessing the probability of recovery of recognized regulatory assets, Xcel Energy noted no current or anticipated proposals or changes in the regulatory environment that it expects will materially impact the probability"}
