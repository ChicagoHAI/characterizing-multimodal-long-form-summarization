MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis is intended to help you understand our results of operations and financial condition. It is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please see the sections entitled \"Certain Forward Looking Information\" and \"Risk Factors\" above for discussions of the uncertainties, risks, and assumptions associated with these statements. Our fiscal year-end financial reporting periods end on the Saturday closest to March 31st. Fiscal year 2016 had 53 weeks and ended on April 2, 2016, fiscal years 2015 and 2014 each had 52 weeks and ended on March 28, 2015, and March 29, 2014, respectively. For purposes of presentation, we have indicated our accounting fiscal year as ending on March 31.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a leading designer, manufacturer, and marketer of lightweight communications headsets, telephone headset systems, other communication endpoints, and accessories for the worldwide business and consumer markets under the Plantronics brand. In addition, we manufacture and market specialty telephone products under our Clarity brand, such as telephones for the hearing impaired, and other related products for people with special communication needs. Our major product categories are Enterprise, which includes headsets optimized for Unified Communications ( UC\u201d), other corded and cordless communication headsets, audio processors, and telephone systems; and Consumer, which includes Bluetooth and corded products for mobile device applications, personal computer (\"PC\") and gaming headsets, and specialty products marketed for hearing impaired individuals.\nCompared to the prior year, net revenues decreased 0.9% to $856.9 million. The decrease in net revenues was driven by lower revenues within our Consumer product category, which declined 6.3% from the prior year. This decline was partially offset by slight growth in our Enterprise product category, which increased 1.2% from the prior year. While our primary driver of revenue growth continues to be revenues from the sale of our UC products, our fiscal year 2016 Consumer revenues were negatively impacted by $22 million due to the rapid decline of the U.S. market for mono Bluetooth headsets. However, we believe we grew our market share in this category, which helped to partially offset the decline. Our fiscal year 2016 revenues were also negatively impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Compared to the other foreign currencies in which we sell, a stronger U.S. Dollar (\"USD\") decreased net revenues by approximately $27 million, net of the effects of hedging, in our fiscal year 2016 compared to the prior year.\nOperating profit decreased 27.5% to $108.0 million, due primarily to restructuring charges taken during fiscal year 2016, the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and the impact of a non-recurring, favorable litigation settlement in fiscal year 2015. The adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted our net revenues but favorably impacted our operating expenses, although to a lesser degree, for a net unfavorable impact of $11 million to our operating profit. These items were partially offset by a reduction in variable compensation expense due to lower profitability. We delivered $68.4 million in net income, representing approximately 8.0% of our net revenues.\nWe generate approximately 40% to 45% of our revenues from international sales; therefore, the impact of currency movements on our net revenues can be significant. In addition, in some international locations where we sell in USD, we also face additional pricing pressure, discounting, and lost business as the stronger dollar negatively impacts buying decisions. Unfavorable impacts from the global economy and consumer spending together with exchange rate fluctuations could continue to negatively impact our net revenues in our fiscal year 2017. We continually work to offset currency movements through hedging strategies designed to minimize the volatility of results and dampen large fluctuations. However, as our revenue hedging instruments cover a period of up to 12 months, the hedging conducted a year ago is expected to deliver little benefit to offset the stronger dollar against other major currencies in fiscal year 2017.\nRevenues from our Consumer products channel are seasonal and typically strongest in our third fiscal quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season. Additionally, other factors directly impact our Consumer product category performance, such as consumer preferences, changes in consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors, product life-cycles (including the introduction and pace of adoption of new technology), and the competitive retail environment. Our Consumer business continues to be impacted by a decline in sales volumes in our mono Bluetooth products as the market for these products contracts. The unit volumes in our stereo Bluetooth category increased slightly when compared to the prior fiscal year, driven primarily by our newer generation of products. We anticipate that these newer products and other planned investments in the Consumer category will allow us to better compete in these consumer product categories as they continue to expand. While we have been building our stereo portfolio over the last several years, it is not yet as robust as our mono Bluetooth portfolio of products. As a result of these market changes, we have reduced the amount we expect to invest in non-premium mono Bluetooth portfolio while shifting that investment toward additional stereo Bluetooth products. This shift toward entertainment solutions is important to our long-term brand position.\nDue to slower than anticipated growth of UC revenues, combined with the negative impact of a strengthening dollar, and a sharp decrease in the U.S. mono Bluetooth market, our fiscal year 2016 revenues declined year over year, causing us to make some necessary changes to reduce our cost structure. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 we initiated a restructuring plan to better align expenses to our revenue and gross margin profile and position us for improved operating performance. Under that plan, we reduced costs through voluntary and involuntary elimination of certain positions throughout the organization in the U.S., Mexico, China, and Europe. The restructuring actions have resulted in pre-tax charges of approximately $16.2 million in our fiscal year 2016.\nLooking forward to fiscal year 2017, UC continues to be our primary focus area. With the vast majority of the UC opportunity still ahead of us, we believe we are in the beginning stage of a potentially long period of growth. We believe UC represents our key long-term driver of revenue and profit growth, as we anticipate UC systems will become more commonly adopted by enterprises to reduce costs and improve collaboration. We believe growth of UC will increase overall headset adoption in enterprise environments, and we expect most of the growth in our Enterprise product category over the next five years to come from headsets designed for UC.\nIn addition, in fiscal year 2017 we are expecting to launch new peripheral \"as-a-service\" offerings which we anticipate will complement our existing suite of product offerings as we move toward a hybrid business model of hardware, software, and services. We believe these enhanced offerings will allow us to expand the reach of our solutions portfolio and scale for growth. Our aim is to simplify our customers' experience and drive a baseline of experiences across our portfolio. During our fiscal year 2017, we will strive to transform data into actionable insights for our customers through software solutions that will offer reporting on asset management, usage, and conversation/acoustic health. In order to achieve these objectives, we will redefine our sales and marketing relationships and harmonize goals across these organizations to ensure we are working toward the same shared vision and go-to-market strategy.\nWe remain cautious about the macroeconomic environment, based on uncertainty around fiscal policy in the U.S., as well as broader economic uncertainty in many parts of Europe and Asia Pacific, which makes it difficult for us to gauge what impact the economy may have on our future business, and the fact that the UC opportunity has not matured as quickly as we initially anticipated. We will continue to monitor our expenditures and prioritize expenditures that further our strategic long-term growth opportunities such as innovative product development in our core research and development efforts, including the use of software and services as part of our portfolio. UC will also remain the central focus of our sales force, marketing group, and other customer service and support teams as we continue investing in key strategic alliances and integrations with major UC vendors.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the consolidated statements of operations data.

Net revenues may vary due to seasonality, the timing of new product introductions and discontinuation of existing products, discounts and other incentives, and channel mix. Net revenues derived from sales of Consumer products into the retail channel typically account for a seasonal increase in net revenues in the third quarter of our fiscal year.\nOur net revenues decreased in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 due largely to a decline in Consumer revenues, which was mainly attributable to the shrinking mono Bluetooth market. This decline was partially offset by slight growth in our Enterprise revenues driven by an increase in demand for UC products resulting from continued adoption of UC voice solutions in the marketplace, partially offset by a slight decline in Core Enterprise (non-UC products).\nA stronger U.S. Dollar (\"USD\") compared to the other foreign currencies in which we sell decreased net revenues by approximately $27 million, net of the effects of hedging, in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015. We generate approximately 44% of our revenues from international sales; therefore, the impact of currency movements on our net revenues can be significant. In fiscal year 2017, our revenues may continue to be affected by uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending.\nOur net revenues increased in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 due largely to growth in Enterprise revenues, which was mainly attributable to growth in demand for UC products driven by continued adoption of UC voice solutions in the marketplace. Growth in our net revenues from Consumer products was the result of continued success in the market of key products such as our Voyager Legend mono Bluetooth headset and our Backbeat GO2 and BackBeat FIT stereo Bluetooth headsets. In addition, we successfully introduced Voyager Edge and Backbeat PRO during our fiscal year 2015, driving incremental sales. Partly offsetting these increases were reductions in revenue from our PC and Entertainment product line as our portfolio was awaiting a refresh which began in fiscal year 2016. A stronger U.S. Dollar (\"USD\") compared to the other foreign currencies in which we sell decreased net revenues by approximately $5 million, net of the effects of hedging, in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014.\nGeographic Information\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>475,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>487,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>487,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>482,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,985\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percentage of net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe and Africa\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>195,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>213,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>213,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>217,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia Pacific\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Americas, excluding United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,907\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.4)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total international net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>343,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>377,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>377,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>374,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,118\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.8)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percentage of net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>818,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>865,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>865,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>856,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8,103\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.9)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs a percentage of total net revenues, U.S. net revenues decreased slightly compared with international revenues in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015. The decrease in absolute dollars in U.S. net revenues was driven primarily by weaker Consumer revenues primarily as a result of the declining mono Bluetooth market, which was partially offset by increased Enterprise net revenues due to continued growth in demand for UC. The decrease in absolute dollars in international revenues was due primarily to decreased Core Enterprise net revenues, partially offset by higher UC and Consumer revenues. International revenues were reduced by approximately $27 million, net of the effects of hedging, in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015, due to unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations in the other foreign currencies in which we sell.\nAs a percentage of total net revenues, U.S. net revenues decreased slightly compared with international revenues in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. The increase in absolute dollars in U.S. net revenues was driven primarily by increased Enterprise net revenues due to continued growth in demand for UC and stronger Consumer revenues as a result of a refreshed and enhanced next generation product portfolio. The increase in absolute dollars in international revenues was due primarily to increased Enterprise net revenues reflecting continued growth in demand for UC products and, to a lesser extent, higher Consumer revenues. International revenues were reduced by approximately $5 million, net of the effects of hedging, in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014, due to unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations in the other foreign currencies in which we sell.\nCost of Revenues and Gross Profit\nCost of revenues consists primarily of direct manufacturing and contract manufacturer costs, warranty expense, freight expense, depreciation, duty expense, reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, royalties, and an allocation of overhead expenses, including facilities, IT, and human resources costs.\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>818,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>865,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>865,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>856,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8,103\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>391,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>403,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>403,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>422,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>426,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>461,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>461,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>434,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(26,945\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCompared to the prior year, gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal year 2016 due primarily to the weakening of foreign currencies relative to the USD, which negatively impacted margins on our international product sales. Gross profit was further negatively impacted by a lower mix of Core Enterprise sales, which carry higher margins than our UC and Consumer categories.\nCompared to the prior year, gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased in fiscal year 2015 due primarily to reductions in product costs and higher revenues from next-generation mobile products carrying better margins. These favorable impacts were offset in part by the following: (i) a shift in product mix from Enterprise to Consumer; (ii) within Enterprise, the continued ramp in UC, which carries lower margins than our non-UC Enterprise products; and (iii) non-recurrence of a favorable adjustment made in fiscal year 2014 to correct an immaterial error related to our warranty and sales returns reserves.\nThere are significant variances in gross profit percentages between our higher and lower margin products; therefore, small variations in product mix, which can be difficult to predict, can have a significant impact on gross profit. Gross profit may also vary based on distribution channel, return rates, and other factors.\nResearch, Development, and Engineering\nResearch, development, and engineering costs are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of compensation costs, outside services, including legal fees associated with protecting our intellectual property, expensed materials, depreciation, and an allocation of overhead expenses, including facilities, IT, and human resources costs.\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research, development and engineering\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,219\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% of total net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in research, development, and engineering expenses in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was due primarily to a reduction in variable compensation associated with lower profitability and a favorable impact due to foreign currency fluctuations . These items were partially offset by higher equity-based compensation expense resulting from restricted stock grants made after May 2013, which vest over three years, compared to restricted stock grants made prior to May 2013, which vest over four years.\nThe increase in research, development, and engineering expenses in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was due primarily to $4.7 million in headcount-related costs, including increased salary expense, and performance-based compensation, and an increase to equity-based compensation resulting from the shorter vesting schedule of restricted stock grants made after May 2013 compared to restricted stock grants made prior to May 2013.\nSelling, General, and Administrative\nSelling, general, and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation costs, marketing costs, travel expenses, professional service fees, and allocations of overhead expenses, including IT, facilities, and human resources costs.\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>201,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>229,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>229,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>221,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8,270\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% of total net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was due primarily to a reduction in variable compensation expense associated with lower profitability, a favorable impact due to foreign currency fluctuations, and reduced legal, IT, and outside services expenses. These decreases were partially offset by higher equity-based compensation expense resulting from the shorter vesting schedule of restricted stock grants made after May 2013 compared to restricted stock grants made prior to May 2013, and an increase in bad debt expense related to RadioShack's bankruptcy proceedings.\nThe increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was due primarily to $13.5 million in higher headcount-related costs resulting from higher performance-based compensation reflecting higher net revenues and higher overall achievement against targets, including an increase to equity-based compensation resulting from the shorter vesting schedule of restricted stock grants made after May 2013 compared to restricted stock grants made prior to May 2013. We also experienced an increase of $3.3 million in depreciation and $7.1 million in higher legal expenses, driven mainly by ongoing litigation.\nGain from Litigation Settlements\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 we recognized gains of approximately $1.2 million, net of immaterial legal contingency fees, within operating income. These gains were primarily the result of net receipts of $0.8 million from a competitor to dismiss litigation involving the alleged infringement of a patent assigned to us as well as miscellaneous immaterial settlements with other parties.\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 we recognized gains of approximately $8.7 million, net of immaterial legal contingency fees, within operating income. These gains were the result of net receipts of $6.5 million from a competitor to dismiss litigation involving the alleged infringement of a patent assigned to us and $2.2 million related to the resolution of an insurance coverage dispute with one of our insurance carriers. There were no such gains for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014.\nRestructuring and Other Related Charges\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and other related charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(547\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% of net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 we initiated a restructuring plan intended to streamline and focus our efforts in order to more closely align our cost structure with our projected future revenue streams, which will better position us for improved operating performance and profitability. This measure was taken as a part of a broader effort to optimize the organization around our long-term strategic initiatives while adjusting for current macroeconomic business conditions and involved the reduction of approximately 125 positions. These staff reductions were substantially complete by the end of fiscal year 2016.\nIn connection with this plan, we have recorded pre-tax charges of approximately $16.2 million, consisting of severance and related benefits. These charges were offset by a reduction in our fiscal year 2016 stock-based compensation expense of $1.5 million attributable to stock award forfeitures resulting from the restructuring action. Projected annual saving from this plan are in the range of approximately $15 to $16 million and will enable us to reduce our cost structure to better support our long-term profitability targets and maintain our competitiveness. See Note 11, Restructuring and Other Related Charges, of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information on restructuring costs.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense of $25.1 million for fiscal year 2016, was primarily related to the 5.50% Senior Notes and included $1.2 million in amortization of debt issuance costs. Interest expense for fiscal years 2015 and 2014 was immaterial and did not include such costs.\nIncome Tax Expense\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>145,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>145,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(63,075\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(43.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19,166\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(58.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>112,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>112,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(116\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>112,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(43,909\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(39.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 is lower than that in the previous year due primarily to domestic interest expense on new debt and tax benefits associated with the unwind of prior cost-sharing of stock based compensation for the engineering function. A retroactive and permanent reinstatement of the federal research credit was signed into law on December 18, 2015. As such, our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 includes the benefit of one quarter of credits for fiscal year 2015 plus the tax benefit for the fiscal year 2016 tax credit.\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal year 2015 is higher than the previous year due primarily to the absence of several one-time, discrete items that benefited the tax rate in the previous year, such as the generation of a foreign tax credit carryover, changes in Mexican tax law that resulted in the reversal of a valuation allowance, and a deduction for qualifying domestic production activities. These factors were offset by a higher proportion of income earned in foreign jurisdictions that is taxed at lower rates and by an increase in the benefit from the U.S. federal research tax credit. Our fiscal year 2015 included four quarters of benefit from the U.S. federal research tax credit because the credit expired on December 31, 2014 but was retroactively reinstated in January 2015. In contrast, during our fiscal year 2014, the credit was only available for three quarters as the credit expired December 31, 2013 and was not renewed.\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014 differs from the statutory rate due to the impact of foreign operations taxed at different statutory rates, income tax credits, state taxes, and other factors. Our future tax rate could be impacted by a shift in the mix of domestic and foreign income, tax treaties with foreign jurisdictions, changes in tax laws in the U.S. or internationally, or a change in estimate of future taxable income, which could result in a valuation allowance being required.\nWe had $12.7 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of March 31, 2016 compared to $12.8 million and $12.6 million as of March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The unrecognized tax benefits as of the end of fiscal year 2016 would favorably impact the effective tax rate in future periods, if recognized.\nIt is our continuing practice to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. As of March 31, 2016, we had approximately $1.6 million of accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions, compared to $1.8 million and $1.7 million as of March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. No penalties have been accrued.\nThe liability for uncertain tax positions may be reduced for liabilities that are settled with taxing authorities or on which the statute of limitations could expire without assessment from tax authorities. Currently, we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of reductions, if any, during the next twelve months.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to taxation in various foreign and state jurisdictions, including the U.S. All federal tax matters have been concluded for tax years prior to fiscal year 2013. The California Franchise Tax Board completed its examination of our 2007 and 2008 tax years. The Company received a Notice of Proposed Assessment and responded by filing a protest letter. The amount of the proposed assessment is not material. Foreign income tax matters for material tax jurisdictions have been concluded for tax years prior to fiscal year 2011, except for the United Kingdom, which has been concluded for tax years prior to fiscal year 2015.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for each of the past three fiscal years:\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash provided by (used for):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>154,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>146,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,947\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,569\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(57,971\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,566\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(131,600\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,405\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(110,034\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(80,534\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(85,218\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(56,697\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,684\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,508\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(156\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,450\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(41,584\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe use cash provided by operating activities as our primary source of liquidity. We expect that cash provided by operating activities will fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our revenues, the timing of product shipments during the quarter, accounts receivable collections, inventory and supply chain management, and the timing and amount of tax and other payments.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the year ended March 31, 2016 decreased from the prior year due primarily to lower net income after adjusting for non-cash items - predominantly the remeasurement of our non-designated hedge instruments, stock-based compensation, non-cash restructuring charges, and depreciation/amortization. These items were partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable, and an increase in accounts payable both driven by a shorter cash conversion cycle.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the year ended March 31, 2015 increased from the prior year due primarily to higher net income after adjusting for non-cash items, predominantly stock-based compensation and depreciation, a decrease in accounts receivable, and an increase in accounts payable both due to improved working capital management. These items were partially offset by increase in current assets related to participant deferrals as part of our deferred compensation plan. Please refer to Note 5, Deferred Compensation of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for more information regarding our deferred compensation plan.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used for investing activities during the year ended March 31, 2016 increased from the year ended March 31, 2015 due to an increase in the net purchases of investments and an increase in capital expenditures.\nNet cash used for investing activities during the year ended March 31, 2015 decreased from the year ended March 31, 2014 due to a decrease in capital expenditures and an increase in the net cash received from sales of investments. Cash used for investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2015 does not include approximately $2.1 million of capital expenditures as the corresponding accruals were included within accounts payable at March 31, 2015 and therefore did not have an impact on cash flows for the period.\nWe anticipate our capital expenditures in fiscal year 2017 to be approximately $25.0 million to $30.0 million, related to costs associated with the purchase and related construction of a new smarter working office for our European headquarters in the Netherlands as well as costs associated with building and leasehold improvements at our U.S. headquarters, the implementation of a manufacturing execution system at our facility in Mexico, and other IT-related expenditures. The remainder of the anticipated capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 consist primarily of capital investment in our manufacturing capabilities, including tooling for new products. We will continue to evaluate new business opportunities and new markets; as a result, our future growth within the existing business or new opportunities and markets may dictate the need for additional facilities and capital expenditures to support that growth.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used for financing activities during the year ended March 31, 2016 decreased from the year ended March 31, 2015 primarily driven by net proceeds received from issuance of the 5.50% Senior Notes partially offset by an increase in the level of common stock repurchases.\nNet cash used for financing activities during the year ended March 31, 2015 increased from the year ended March 31, 2014 due to an increase in the level of common stock repurchases and an increase in our quarterly dividend beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2015. These items were partially offset by an increase in proceeds from our revolving line of credit.\nOn May 3, 2016, we announced that our Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (\"the Audit Committee\") had declared a cash dividend of $0.15 per share of our common stock, payable on June 10, 2016 to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 20, 2016. We expect to continue paying a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share of our common stock; however, the actual declaration of dividends and the establishment of record and payment dates are subject to final determination by the Audit Committee each quarter after its review of our financial performance and financial position.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary discretionary cash uses have historically been for repurchases of our common stock and dividend payments. At March 31, 2016, we had working capital of $487.8 million, including $395.3 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, compared to working capital of $507.8 million, including $374.7 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at March 31, 2015. The decrease in working capital at March 31, 2016 compared to March 31, 2015 results from the decrease in accounts receivable and increase in accounts payable both due primarily to improved working capital management.\nOur cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2016 consist of bank deposits with third party financial institutions, Commercial Paper, and Corporate Bonds. We monitor bank balances in our operating accounts and adjust the balances as appropriate. Cash balances are held throughout the world, including substantial amounts held outside of the U.S. As of March 31, 2016, of our $395.3 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, $40.9 million is held domestically while $354.4 million is held by foreign subsidiaries, approximately 90% of which were based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. The costs to repatriate our foreign earnings to the U.S. would likely be material; however, our intent is to indefinitely reinvest our earnings from foreign operations, and our current plans do not require us to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations as we generate sufficient domestic operating cash flow and have access to external funding under our current revolving line of credit. Our investments are intended to establish a high-quality portfolio that preserves principal and meets liquidity needs. As of March 31, 2016, our investments are composed of Mutual Funds, US Treasury Notes, Government Agency Securities, Commercial Paper, Corporate Bonds, and Certificates of Deposits (\"CDs\").\nFrom time to time, our Board of Directors (\"the Board\") authorizes programs under which we may repurchase shares of our common stock, depending on market conditions, in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, including accelerated stock repurchase agreements. The following table summarizes our repurchase of common stock as part of these publicly announced repurchase programs as well as shares withheld in satisfaction of employee tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock granted under our stock plans:\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions except share data)\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repurchase of common stock:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shares\n</td> <td>1,949,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,221,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,077,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>112.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>497.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employees' tax withheld and paid for restricted stock and restricted stock units:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shares\n</td> <td>138,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of March 31, 2016, there remained a total of 634,011 shares authorized for repurchase under the stock repurchase program approved by the Board on January 29, 2016. Refer to Note 12, Common Stock Repurchases, of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for more information regarding our stock repurchase programs. We had no retirements of treasury stock in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014.\nIn May 2015, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the Bank\u201d). The Credit Agreement amended and restated our prior credit agreement, dated as of May 2011. The Credit Agreement provides for a $100.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility to augment our financial flexibility. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are required to be guaranteed by the Company's domestic subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions.\nIn May 2016, we executed a First Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and Limited Waiver (the Amended Credit Agreement\u201d). The Amended Credit Agreement extends the term of the Credit Agreement by one year to May 9, 2019, and waives a default under the Credit Agreement in effect as of March 31, 2016 in which our debt to EBITDA ratio minimally exceeded the previously agreed upon ratio of 3:1. The breach of the covenant was primarily a result of our restructuring activities in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2016.\nRevolving loans under the Amended Credit Agreement will bear interest, at our election, at (i) the Bank's announced prime rate less 1.20% per annum or (ii) a daily one-month LIBOR rate plus 1.40% per annum. Principal, together with all accrued and unpaid interest, on the revolving loans is due and payable on May 9, 2019. The Company is also obligated to pay a commitment fee of 0.37% per annum on the average daily unused amount of the revolving line of credit, which fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears. The Company may prepay the loans and terminate the commitments under the Amended Credit Agreement at any time, without premium or penalty, subject to the reimbursement of certain costs. As of March 31, 2016 the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the line of credit. The line of credit requires us to comply with the following two financial covenant ratios, in each case at each fiscal quarter end and determined on a rolling four-quarter basis:\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>maximum ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"); and,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>minimum EBITDA coverage ratio, which is calculated as interest payments divided by EBITDA.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, we and our subsidiaries are required to maintain unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities plus availability under the Amended Credit Agreement at the end of each fiscal quarter of at least $300.0 million. The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary events of default that include, among other things, payment defaults, covenant defaults, cross-defaults with certain other indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults, and judgment defaults. The occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of the obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement. As of March 31, 2016, we were in breach of our debt to EBITDA ratio covenant but in compliance with all other ratios and covenants by a substantial margin.\nOn May 2, 2016, we received a waiver from the lender for noncompliance with the minimum EBITDA covenant at March 31, 2016. Pursuant to the terms of the waiver and amendment to the Credit Agreement, the $16.2 million of restructuring charges recorded in our fiscal year 2016 will be excluded from the lender's rolling four-quarter EBITDA calculation. This exclusion of restructuring charges does not automatically extend to any such future charges, should they be incurred.\nThis breach is not considered to be a cross-default on our 5.50% Senior Notes and as such has no impact on the amount or timing of amounts payable related to these debt instruments.\nOur liquidity, capital resources, and results of operations in any period could be affected by repurchases of our common stock, the payment of cash dividends, the exercise of outstanding stock options, restricted stock grants under stock plans, and the issuance of common stock under our ESPP. We receive cash from the exercise of outstanding stock options under our stock plan and the issuance of shares under our ESPP. However, the resulting increase in the number of outstanding shares from these equity grants and issuances could affect our earnings per share. We cannot predict the timing or amount of proceeds from the sale or exercise of these securities or whether they will be exercised, forfeited, canceled, or will expire.\nWe believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash provided by operations, and the availability of additional funds under the Amended Credit Agreement will be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next 12 months; however, any projections of future financial needs and sources of working capital are subject to uncertainty. Readers are cautioned to review the risks, uncertainties, and assumptions set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the sections entitled Certain Forward-Looking Information\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d for factors that could affect our estimates for future financial needs and sources of working capital.\nOFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nWe have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides us with financing and liquidity support, market risk, or credit risk support.\nA substantial portion of the raw materials, components, and subassemblies used in our products are provided by our suppliers on a consignment basis. These consigned inventories are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet until we take title to the raw materials, components, and subassemblies, which occurs when they are consumed in the production process. Prior to consumption in the production process, our suppliers bear the risk of loss and retain title to the consigned inventory. The terms of the agreements allow the Company to return parts in excess of maximum order quantities to the suppliers at the supplier's expense. Returns for other reasons are negotiated with the suppliers on a case-by-case basis and to date have been immaterial. If our suppliers were to discontinue financing consigned inventory, it would require us to make cash outlays and we could incur expenses which, if material, could negatively affect our business and financial results. As of March 31, 2016 and 2015, we had off-balance sheet consigned inventories of $41.1 million and $33.4 million, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes our future contractual obligations as of March 31, 2016 and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unconditional purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>145,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long term debt (5.50% Senior Notes)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>707,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>569,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>867,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>175,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>571,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Leases\nWe lease certain facilities under operating leases expiring through our fiscal year 2026. Certain of these leases provide for renewal options for periods ranging from one to three years and in the normal course of business, we may exercise the renewal options.\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nWe utilize several contract manufacturers to manufacture raw materials, components, and subassemblies for our products. We provide these contract manufacturers with demand information that typically covers periods up to 13 weeks, and they use this information to acquire components and build products. We also obtain individual components for our products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, we acquire components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. As of March 31, 2016, we had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of $150.9 million, all of which we expect to consume in the normal course of business.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nAs of March 31, 2016, long-term income taxes payable reported on our consolidated balance sheet included unrecognized tax benefits and related interest of $12.7 million and $1.6 million, respectively. We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to unrecognized tax benefits and they are not included in the contractual obligations table above. We do not anticipate any material cash payments associated with our unrecognized tax benefits to be made within the next twelve months.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"). In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends, future expectations and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On an ongoing basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require our most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee.\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Revenue Recognition and Related Allowances\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Inventory Valuation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Product Warranty Obligations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Income Taxes\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue Recognition and Related Allowances\nWe sell substantially all of our products to end users through distributors, retailers, and carriers. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonable assured. For most of the Company's product sales, these criteria are met at either the time the product is shipped or the customer has received the product. Commercial distributors and retailers represent our largest sources of net revenues. Sales through our distribution and retail channels are made primarily under agreements allowing for rights of return and include various sales incentive programs, such as rebates, advertising, price protection, and other sales incentives. We have an established sales history for these arrangements and we record the estimated reserves and allowances at the time the related revenue is recognized. Customer sales returns are estimated based on historical data, relevant current data, and the monitoring of inventory build-up in the distribution channel.\nThe primary factors affecting our reserve for estimated customer sales returns include the general timing of historical returns and estimated return rates. The allowance for sales incentive programs is based on contractual terms and historical experience in the form of payments or sell-through credits redeemed by our customers. Future market conditions or an evaluation of partner incentives may lead us to increase customer incentive offerings, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue.\nWe have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to measure sales return reserves or incentive allowances during the past three fiscal years. Substantially all credits associated with these activities are processed within the following fiscal year, and therefore, do not require subjective long-term estimates; however, if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. If we increased our estimate as of March 31, 2016 by a hypothetical 10%, our sales returns reserve and sales incentive allowance would have increased by approximately $0.7 million and $1.2 million, respectively. Net of the estimated value of the inventory that would be returned, this would have decreased gross profit and net income by approximately $4.0 million and $3.3 million, respectively.\nWhen a sales arrangement contains multiple elements, such as hardware and software products and/or services, we allocate revenue to each element based on relative selling prices. The selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor specific objective evidence (\"VSOE\"), if available, third party evidence (\"TPE\") if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price (\"ESP\") if neither VSOE nor TPE are available. In multiple element arrangements where more-than-incidental software deliverables are included, we allocate revenue to each separate unit of accounting for each of the non-software deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. Revenue recognized for the software portion of multiple element arrangements was less than 1% of total net revenues for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015. As of March 31, 2016 and 2015, total deferred revenue related to the software portion of multiple-element arrangements was $2.7 million and $2.0 million, respectively.\nInventory Valuation\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. The Company writes down inventories that have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. Our estimate of write downs for excess and obsolete inventory is based on a detailed analysis of on-hand inventory and purchase commitments in excess of forecasted demand. Our products require long-lead time parts available from a limited number of vendors and, occasionally, last-time buys of raw materials for products with long lifecycles. The effects of demand variability, long-lead times, and last-time buys have historically contributed to inventory write-downs. Our demand forecast considers projected future shipments, market conditions, inventory on hand, purchase commitments, product development plans and product life cycle, inventory on consignment, and other competitive factors. Refer to \"Off Balance Sheet Arrangements\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details regarding consigned inventories.\nWe have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to estimate our inventory write-downs or adverse purchase commitments during the past three fiscal years. If the demand or market conditions for our products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of our inventory, we may be required to record additional inventory write-downs or adverse purchase commitments, which would negatively affect our results of operations in the period the write-downs or adverse purchase commitments were recorded. If we increased our inventory reserve and adverse purchase commitment reserve estimates as of March 31, 2016 by a hypothetical 10%, the reserves and cost of revenues would have each increased by approximately $0.4 million and our net income would have been reduced by approximately $0.4 million.\nProduct Warranty Obligations\nThe Company records a liability for the estimated costs of warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. Factors that affect the warranty obligation include historical and projected product failure rates, estimated return rates, material usage, service related costs incurred in correcting product failure claims, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company's typical experience. If actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. If we increased our warranty obligation estimate as of March 31, 2016 by a hypothetical 10%, our obligation and the associated cost of revenues would have each increased by approximately $0.9 million and our net income would have been reduced by approximately $0.6 million.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions and our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits may include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years may be subject to audit by various tax authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a liability for such exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a liability is audited and fully resolved or clarified.\nTo the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would generally require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.\nWe recognize the impact of an uncertain income tax position on income tax expense at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained. An unrecognized tax benefit will not be recognized unless it has a greater than 50% likelihood of being sustained. We adjust our tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position, or when more information becomes available. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions.\nOur provision for income taxes does not include provisions for U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign operations that we intend to reinvest indefinitely in the foreign operations. If these earnings were distributed to the U.S. in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes, subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits, and foreign withholding taxes. Our current plans do not require repatriation of earnings from foreign operations to fund the U.S. operations because we generate sufficient domestic operating cash flow and have access to external funding under our line of credit. As a result, we do not expect a material impact on our business or financial flexibility with respect to undistributed earnings of our foreign operations.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRecently Issued Pronouncements\nIn March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued additional guidance regarding share-based compensation, which outlines new provisions intended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for share-based payments and their presentation in the financial statements. The guidance is effective our fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect this new accounting guidance may have on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued additional guidance regarding both operating and financing leases, requiring lessees to recognize on their balance sheets right-of-use assets\u201d and corresponding lease liabilities, measured on a discounted basis over the lease term. Virtually all leases will be subject to this treatment except leases that meet the definition of a short-term lease.\u201d For expense recognition, the dual model requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance leases has been retained from the prior standard. Operating leases will result in straight-line expense while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern. Classification will use criteria very similar to those applied in current lease accounting, but without explicit bright lines. Extensive additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures, including significant judgments made by management, will be required to provide greater insight into the extent of expense recognized and expected to be recognized. The new lease guidance will essentially eliminate off-balance sheet financing. The guidance is effective for our fiscal year ending March 31, 2020. The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition that provides for certain practical expedients and requires the new guidance to be applied at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. We are currently evaluating the effect this new accounting guidance may have on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued additional guidance regarding the recognition and measurement of financial assets and liabilities. Changes to the current GAAP model primarily affect the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, the FASB clarified guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. We are required to adopt the standard in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending March 31, 2019, but may elect to adopt earlier as permitted under the standard. We are currently evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued additional guidance regarding the subsequent measurement of inventory by requiring inventory to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. We are required to adopt the standard in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending March 31, 2018, but may elect to adopt earlier as permitted under the standard. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued additional guidance regarding cloud computing arrangements. The guidance requires registrants to account for a cloud computing arrangement that includes a software license element consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. Cloud computing arrangement without software licenses are to be accounted for as a service contract. This guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. We have elected to adopt the new standard beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2016. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued additional guidance regarding revenue from contracts with customers. Under the new standard, revenue will be recognized at the time a good or service is transferred to a customer for the amount of consideration received for that specific good or service. Entities may use a full retrospective approach or report the cumulative effect as of the date of adoption. In March 2016, the FASB issued additional guidance concerning \"Principal versus Agent\" considerations (reporting revenue gross versus net); in April 2016, the FASB issued additional guidance on identifying performance obligations and licensing; and in May 2016, the FASB issued additional guidance on collectibility, noncash consideration, presentation of sales tax, and transition. These updates are intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance and have the same effective date and transition requirements as the greater \"contracts with customers\" standard. We are required to adopt the standard, as amended, in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending March 31, 2018 although, under the standard, we may adopt as early as the first quarter of our fiscal year ending March 31, 2017. Presently, we are not yet in a position to assess the application date. We are currently evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis is intended to help you understand our results of operations and financial condition. It is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please see the sections entitled \"Certain Forward Looking Information\" and \"Risk Factors\" above for discussions of the uncertainties, risks, and assumptions associated with these statements. Our fiscal year-end financial reporting periods end on the Saturday closest to March 31st. Fiscal year 2016 had 53 weeks and ended on April 2, 2016, fiscal years 2015 and 2014 each had 52 weeks and ended on March 28, 2015, and March 29, 2014, respectively. For purposes of presentation, we have indicated our accounting fiscal year as ending on March 31.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a leading designer, manufacturer, and marketer of lightweight communications headsets, telephone headset systems, other communication endpoints, and accessories for the worldwide business and consumer markets under the Plantronics brand. In addition, we manufacture and market specialty telephone products under our Clarity brand, such as telephones for the hearing impaired, and other related products for people with special communication needs. Our major product categories are Enterprise, which includes headsets optimized for Unified Communications ( UC\u201d), other corded and cordless communication headsets, audio processors, and telephone systems; and Consumer, which includes Bluetooth and corded products for mobile device applications, personal computer (\"PC\") and gaming headsets, and specialty products marketed for hearing impaired individuals.\nCompared to the prior year, net revenues decreased 0.9% to $856.9 million. The decrease in net revenues was driven by lower revenues within our Consumer product category, which declined 6.3% from the prior year. This decline was partially offset by slight growth in our Enterprise product category, which increased 1.2% from the prior year. While our primary driver of revenue growth continues to be revenues from the sale of our UC products, our fiscal year 2016 Consumer revenues were negatively impacted by $22 million due to the rapid decline of the U.S. market for mono Bluetooth headsets. However, we believe we grew our market share in this category, which helped to partially offset the decline. Our fiscal year 2016 revenues were also negatively impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Compared to the other foreign currencies in which we sell, a stronger U.S. Dollar (\"USD\") decreased net revenues by approximately $27 million, net of the effects of hedging, in our fiscal year 2016 compared to the prior year.\nOperating profit decreased 27.5% to $108.0 million, due primarily to restructuring charges taken during fiscal year 2016, the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and the impact of a non-recurring, favorable litigation settlement in fiscal year 2015. The adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted our net revenues but favorably impacted our operating expenses, although to a lesser degree, for a net unfavorable impact of $11 million to our operating profit. These items were partially offset by a reduction in variable compensation expense due to lower profitability. We delivered $68.4 million in net income, representing approximately 8.0% of our net revenues.\nWe generate approximately 40% to 45% of our revenues from international sales; therefore, the impact of currency movements on our net revenues can be significant. In addition, in some international locations where we sell in USD, we also face additional pricing pressure, discounting, and lost business as the stronger dollar negatively impacts buying decisions. Unfavorable impacts from the global economy and consumer spending together with exchange rate fluctuations could continue to negatively impact our net revenues in our fiscal year 2017. We continually work to offset currency movements through hedging strategies designed to minimize the volatility of results and dampen large fluctuations. However, as our revenue hedging instruments cover a period of up to 12 months, the hedging conducted a year ago is expected to deliver little benefit to offset the stronger dollar against other major currencies in fiscal year 2017.\nRevenues from our Consumer products channel are seasonal and typically strongest in our third fiscal quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season. Additionally, other factors directly impact our Consumer product category performance, such as consumer preferences, changes in consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors, product life-cycles (including the introduction and pace of adoption of new technology), and the competitive retail environment. Our Consumer business continues to be impacted by a decline in sales volumes in our mono Bluetooth products as the market for these products contracts. The unit volumes in our stereo Bluetooth category increased slightly when compared to the prior fiscal year, driven primarily by our newer generation of products. We anticipate that these newer products and other planned investments in the Consumer category will allow us to better compete in these consumer product categories as they continue to expand. While we have been building our stereo portfolio over the last several years, it is not yet as robust as our mono Bluetooth portfolio of products. As a result of these market changes, we have reduced the amount we expect to invest in non-premium mono Bluetooth portfolio while shifting that investment toward additional stereo Bluetooth products. This shift toward entertainment solutions is important to our long-term brand position.\nDue to slower than anticipated growth of UC revenues, combined with the negative impact of a strengthening dollar, and a sharp decrease in the U.S. mono Bluetooth market, our fiscal year 2016 revenues declined year over year, causing us to make some necessary changes to reduce our cost structure. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 we initiated a restructuring plan to better align expenses to our revenue and gross margin profile and position us for improved operating performance. Under that plan, we reduced costs through voluntary and involuntary elimination of certain positions throughout the organization in the U.S., Mexico, China, and Europe. The restructuring actions have resulted in pre-tax charges of approximately $16.2 million in our fiscal year 2016.\nLooking forward to fiscal year 2017, UC continues to be our primary focus area. With the vast majority of the UC opportunity still ahead of us, we believe we are in the beginning stage of a potentially long period of growth. We believe UC represents our key long-term driver of revenue and profit growth, as we anticipate UC systems will become more commonly adopted by enterprises to reduce costs and improve collaboration. We believe growth of UC will increase overall headset adoption in enterprise environments, and we expect most of the growth in our Enterprise product category over the next five years to come from headsets designed for UC.\nIn addition, in fiscal year 2017 we are expecting to launch new peripheral \"as-a-service\" offerings which we anticipate will complement our existing suite of product offerings as we move toward a hybrid business model of hardware, software, and services. We believe these enhanced offerings will allow us to expand the reach of our solutions portfolio and scale for growth. Our aim is to simplify our customers' experience and drive a baseline of experiences across our portfolio. During our fiscal year 2017, we will strive to transform data into actionable insights for our customers through software solutions that will offer reporting on asset management, usage, and conversation/acoustic health. In order to achieve these objectives, we will redefine our sales and marketing relationships and harmonize goals across these organizations to ensure we are working toward the same shared vision and go-to-market strategy.\nWe remain cautious about the macroeconomic environment, based on uncertainty around fiscal policy in the U.S., as well as broader economic uncertainty in many parts of Europe and Asia Pacific, which makes it difficult for us to gauge what impact the economy may have on our future business, and the fact that the UC opportunity has not matured as quickly as we initially anticipated. We will continue to monitor our expenditures and prioritize expenditures that further our strategic long-term growth opportunities such as innovative product development in our core research and development efforts, including the use of software and services as part of our portfolio. UC will also remain the central focus of our sales force, marketing group, and other customer service and support teams as we continue investing in key strategic alliances and integrations with major UC vendors.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the consolidated statements of operations data. The financial information and the ensuing discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.\nNet Revenues\n\nEnterprise products represent our largest source of revenues, while Consumer products represent our largest unit volumes. Net revenues may vary due to seasonality, the timing of new product introductions and discontinuation of existing products, discounts and other incentives, and channel mix. Net revenues derived from sales of Consumer products into the retail channel typically account for a seasonal increase in net revenues in the third quarter of our fiscal year.\nOur net revenues decreased in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 due largely to a decline in Consumer revenues, which was mainly attributable to the shrinking mono Bluetooth market. This decline was partially offset by slight growth in our Enterprise revenues driven by an increase in demand for UC products resulting from continued adoption of UC voice solutions in the marketplace, partially offset by a slight decline in Core Enterprise (non-UC products).\nA stronger U.S. Dollar (\"USD\") compared to the other foreign currencies in which we sell decreased net revenues by approximately $27 million, net of the effects of hedging, in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015. We generate approximately 44% of our revenues from international sales; therefore, the impact of currency movements on our net revenues can be significant. In fiscal year 2017, our revenues may continue to be affected by uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending.\nOur net revenues increased in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 due largely to growth in Enterprise revenues, which was mainly attributable to growth in demand for UC products driven by continued adoption of UC voice solutions in the marketplace. Growth in our net revenues from Consumer products was the result of continued success in the market of key products such as our Voyager Legend mono Bluetooth headset and our Backbeat GO2 and BackBeat FIT stereo Bluetooth headsets. In addition, we successfully introduced Voyager Edge and Backbeat PRO during our fiscal year 2015, driving incremental sales. Partly offsetting these increases were reductions in revenue from our PC and Entertainment product line as our portfolio was awaiting a refresh which began in fiscal year 2016. A stronger U.S. Dollar (\"USD\") compared to the other foreign currencies in which we sell decreased net revenues by approximately $5 million, net of the effects of hedging, in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014.\nGeographic Information\n\nAs a percentage of total net revenues, U.S. net revenues decreased slightly compared with international revenues in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015. The decrease in absolute dollars in U.S. net revenues was driven primarily by weaker Consumer revenues primarily as a result of the declining mono Bluetooth market, which was partially offset by increased Enterprise net revenues due to continued growth in demand for UC. The decrease in absolute dollars in international revenues was due primarily to decreased Core Enterprise net revenues, partially offset by higher UC and Consumer revenues. International revenues were reduced by approximately $27 million, net of the effects of hedging, in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015, due to unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations in the other foreign currencies in which we sell.\nAs a percentage of total net revenues, U.S. net revenues decreased slightly compared with international revenues in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. The increase in absolute dollars in U.S. net revenues was driven primarily by increased Enterprise net revenues due to continued growth in demand for UC and stronger Consumer revenues as a result of a refreshed and enhanced next generation product portfolio. The increase in absolute dollars in international revenues was due primarily to increased Enterprise net revenues reflecting continued growth in demand for UC products and, to a lesser extent, higher Consumer revenues. International revenues were reduced by approximately $5 million, net of the effects of hedging, in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014, due to unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations in the other foreign currencies in which we sell.\nCost of Revenues and Gross Profit\nCost of revenues consists primarily of direct manufacturing and contract manufacturer costs, warranty expense, freight expense, depreciation, duty expense, reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, royalties, and an allocation of overhead expenses, including facilities, IT, and human resources costs.\n\nCompared to the prior year, gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal year 2016 due primarily to the weakening of foreign currencies relative to the USD, which negatively impacted margins on our international product sales. Gross profit was further negatively impacted by a lower mix of Core Enterprise sales, which carry higher margins than our UC and Consumer categories.\nCompared to the prior year, gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased in fiscal year 2015 due primarily to reductions in product costs and higher revenues from next-generation mobile products carrying better margins. These favorable impacts were offset in part by the following: (i) a shift in product mix from Enterprise to Consumer; (ii) within Enterprise, the continued ramp in UC, which carries lower margins than our non-UC Enterprise products; and (iii) non-recurrence of a favorable adjustment made in fiscal year 2014 to correct an immaterial error related to our warranty and sales returns reserves.\nThere are significant variances in gross profit percentages between our higher and lower margin products; therefore, small variations in product mix, which can be difficult to predict, can have a significant impact on gross profit. Gross profit may also vary based on distribution channel, return rates, and other factors.\nResearch, Development, and Engineering\nResearch, development, and engineering costs are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of compensation costs, outside services, including legal fees associated with protecting our intellectual property, expensed materials, depreciation, and an allocation of overhead expenses, including facilities, IT, and human resources costs.\n\nThe decrease in research, development, and engineering expenses in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was due primarily to a reduction in variable compensation associated with lower profitability and a favorable impact due to foreign currency fluctuations . These items were partially offset by higher equity-based compensation expense resulting from restricted stock grants made after May 2013, which vest over three years, compared to restricted stock grants made prior to May 2013, which vest over four years.\nThe increase in research, development, and engineering expenses in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was due primarily to $4.7 million in headcount-related costs, including increased salary expense, and performance-based compensation, and an increase to equity-based compensation resulting from the shorter vesting schedule of restricted stock grants made after May 2013 compared to restricted stock grants made prior to May 2013.\nSelling, General, and Administrative\nSelling, general, and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation costs, marketing costs, travel expenses, professional service fees, and allocations of overhead expenses, including IT, facilities, and human resources costs.\n\nThe decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was due primarily to a reduction in variable compensation expense associated with lower profitability, a favorable impact due to foreign currency fluctuations, and reduced legal, IT, and outside services expenses. These decreases were partially offset by higher equity-based compensation expense resulting from the shorter vesting schedule of restricted stock grants made after May 2013 compared to restricted stock grants made prior to May 2013, and an increase in bad debt expense related to RadioShack's bankruptcy proceedings.\nThe increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was due primarily to $13.5 million in higher headcount-related costs resulting from higher performance-based compensation reflecting higher net revenues and higher overall achievement against targets, including an increase to equity-based compensation resulting from the shorter vesting schedule of restricted stock grants made after May 2013 compared to restricted stock grants made prior to May 2013. We also experienced an increase of $3.3 million in depreciation and $7.1 million in higher legal expenses, driven mainly by ongoing litigation.\nGain from Litigation Settlements\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 we recognized gains of approximately $1.2 million, net of immaterial legal contingency fees, within operating income. These gains were primarily the result of net receipts of $0.8 million from a competitor to dismiss litigation involving the alleged infringement of a patent assigned to us as well as miscellaneous immaterial settlements with other parties.\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 we recognized gains of approximately $8.7 million, net of immaterial legal contingency fees, within operating income. These gains were the result of net receipts of $6.5 million from a competitor to dismiss litigation involving the alleged infringement of a patent assigned to us and $2.2 million related to the resolution of an insurance coverage dispute with one of our insurance carriers. There were no such gains for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014.\nRestructuring and Other Related Charges\n\nIn the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 we initiated a restructuring plan intended to streamline and focus our efforts in order to more closely align our cost structure with our projected future revenue streams, which will better position us for improved operating performance and profitability. This measure was taken as a part of a broader effort to optimize the organization around our long-term strategic initiatives while adjusting for current macroeconomic business conditions and involved the reduction of approximately 125 positions. These staff reductions were substantially complete by the end of fiscal year 2016.\nIn connection with this plan, we have recorded pre-tax charges of approximately $16.2 million, consisting of severance and related benefits. These charges were offset by a reduction in our fiscal year 2016 stock-based compensation expense of $1.5 million attributable to stock award forfeitures resulting from the restructuring action. Projected annual saving from this plan are in the range of approximately $15 to $16 million and will enable us to reduce our cost structure to better support our long-term profitability targets and maintain our competitiveness. See Note 11, Restructuring and Other Related Charges, of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information on restructuring costs.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense of $25.1 million for fiscal year 2016, was primarily related to the 5.50% Senior Notes and included $1.2 million in amortization of debt issuance costs. Interest expense for fiscal years 2015 and 2014 was immaterial and did not include such costs.\nIncome Tax Expense\n\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 is lower than that in the previous year due primarily to domestic interest expense on new debt and tax benefits associated with the unwind of prior cost-sharing of stock based compensation for the engineering function. A retroactive and permanent reinstatement of the federal research credit was signed into law on December 18, 2015. As such, our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 includes the benefit of one quarter of credits for fiscal year 2015 plus the tax benefit for the fiscal year 2016 tax credit.\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal year 2015 is higher than the previous year due primarily to the absence of several one-time, discrete items that benefited the tax rate in the previous year, such as the generation of a foreign tax credit carryover, changes in Mexican tax law that resulted in the reversal of a valuation allowance, and a deduction for qualifying domestic production activities. These factors were offset by a higher proportion of income earned in foreign jurisdictions that is taxed at lower rates and by an increase in the benefit from the U.S. federal research tax credit. Our fiscal year 2015 included four quarters of benefit from the U.S. federal research tax credit because the credit expired on December 31, 2014 but was retroactively reinstated in January 2015. In contrast, during our fiscal year 2014, the credit was only available for three quarters as the credit expired December 31, 2013 and was not renewed.\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014 differs from the statutory rate due to the impact of foreign operations taxed at different statutory rates, income tax credits, state taxes, and other factors. Our future tax rate could be impacted by a shift in the mix of domestic and foreign income, tax treaties with foreign jurisdictions, changes in tax laws in the U.S. or internationally, or a change in estimate of future taxable income, which could result in a valuation allowance being required.\nWe had $12.7 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of March 31, 2016 compared to $12.8 million and $12.6 million as of March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The unrecognized tax benefits as of the end of fiscal year 2016 would favorably impact the effective tax rate in future periods, if recognized.\nIt is our continuing practice to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. As of March 31, 2016, we had approximately $1.6 million of accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions, compared to $1.8 million and $1.7 million as of March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. No penalties have been accrued.\nThe liability for uncertain tax positions may be reduced for liabilities that are settled with taxing authorities or on which the statute of limitations could expire without assessment from tax authorities. Currently, we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of reductions, if any, during the next twelve months.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to taxation in various foreign and state jurisdictions, including the U.S. All federal tax matters have been concluded for tax years prior to fiscal year 2013. The California Franchise Tax Board completed its examination of our 2007 and 2008 tax years. The Company received a Notice of Proposed Assessment and responded by filing a protest letter. The amount of the proposed assessment is not material. Foreign income tax matters for material tax jurisdictions have been concluded for tax years prior to fiscal year 2011, except for the United Kingdom, which has been concluded for tax years prior to fiscal year 2015.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for each of the past three fiscal years:\n\nWe use cash provided by operating activities as our primary source of liquidity. We expect that cash provided by operating activities will fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our revenues, the timing of product shipments during the quarter, accounts receivable collections, inventory and supply chain management, and the timing and amount of tax and other payments.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the year ended March 31, 2016 decreased from the prior year due primarily to lower net income after adjusting for non-cash items - predominantly the remeasurement of our non-designated hedge instruments, stock-based compensation, non-cash restructuring charges, and depreciation/amortization. These items were partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable, and an increase in accounts payable both driven by a shorter cash conversion cycle.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the year ended March 31, 2015 increased from the prior year due primarily to higher net income after adjusting for non-cash items, predominantly stock-based compensation and depreciation, a decrease in accounts receivable, and an increase in accounts payable both due to improved working capital management. These items were partially offset by increase in current assets related to participant deferrals as part of our deferred compensation plan. Please refer to Note 5, Deferred Compensation of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for more information regarding our deferred compensation plan.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used for investing activities during the year ended March 31, 2016 increased from the year ended March 31, 2015 due to an increase in the net purchases of investments and an increase in capital expenditures.\nNet cash used for investing activities during the year ended March 31, 2015 decreased from the year ended March 31, 2014 due to a decrease in capital expenditures and an increase in the net cash received from sales of investments. Cash used for investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2015 does not include approximately $2.1 million of capital expenditures as the corresponding accruals were included within accounts payable at March 31, 2015 and therefore did not have an impact on cash flows for the period.\nWe anticipate our capital expenditures in fiscal year 2017 to be approximately $25.0 million to $30.0 million, related to costs associated with the purchase and related construction of a new smarter working office for our European headquarters in the Netherlands as well as costs associated with building and leasehold improvements at our U.S. headquarters, the implementation of a manufacturing execution system at our facility in Mexico, and other IT-related expenditures. The remainder of the anticipated capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 consist primarily of capital investment in our manufacturing capabilities, including tooling for new products. We will continue to evaluate new business opportunities and new markets; as a result, our future growth within the existing business or new opportunities and markets may dictate the need for additional facilities and capital expenditures to support that growth.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used for financing activities during the year ended March 31, 2016 decreased from the year ended March 31, 2015 primarily driven by net proceeds received from issuance of the 5.50% Senior Notes partially offset by an increase in the level of common stock repurchases.\nNet cash used for financing activities during the year ended March 31, 2015 increased from the year ended March 31, 2014 due to an increase in the level of common stock repurchases and an increase in our quarterly dividend beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2015. These items were partially offset by an increase in proceeds from our revolving line of credit.\nOn May 3, 2016, we announced that our Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (\"the Audit Committee\") had declared a cash dividend of $0.15 per share of our common stock, payable on June 10, 2016 to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 20, 2016. We expect to continue paying a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share of our common stock; however, the actual declaration of dividends and the establishment of record and payment dates are subject to final determination by the Audit Committee each quarter after its review of our financial performance and financial position.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary discretionary cash uses have historically been for repurchases of our common stock and dividend payments. At March 31, 2016, we had working capital of $487.8 million, including $395.3 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, compared to working capital of $507.8 million, including $374.7 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at March 31, 2015. The decrease in working capital at March 31, 2016 compared to March 31, 2015 results from the decrease in accounts receivable and increase in accounts payable both due primarily to improved working capital management.\nOur cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2016 consist of bank deposits with third party financial institutions, Commercial Paper, and Corporate Bonds. We monitor bank balances in our operating accounts and adjust the balances as appropriate. Cash balances are held throughout the world, including substantial amounts held outside of the U.S. As of March 31, 2016, of our $395.3 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, $40.9 million is held domestically while $354.4 million is held by foreign subsidiaries, approximately 90% of which were based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. The costs to repatriate our foreign earnings to the U.S. would likely be material; however, our intent is to indefinitely reinvest our earnings from foreign operations, and our current plans do not require us to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations as we generate sufficient domestic operating cash flow and have access to external funding under our current revolving line of credit. Our investments are intended to establish a high-quality portfolio that preserves principal and meets liquidity needs. As of March 31, 2016, our investments are composed of Mutual Funds, US Treasury Notes, Government Agency Securities, Commercial Paper, Corporate Bonds, and Certificates of Deposits (\"CDs\").\nFrom time to time, our Board of Directors (\"the Board\") authorizes programs under which we may repurchase shares of our common stock, depending on market conditions, in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, including accelerated stock repurchase agreements. The following table summarizes our repurchase of common stock as part of these publicly announced repurchase programs as well as shares withheld in satisfaction of employee tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock granted under our stock plans:\n\nAs of March 31, 2016, there remained a total of 634,011 shares authorized for repurchase under the stock repurchase program approved by the Board on January 29, 2016. Refer to Note 12, Common Stock Repurchases, of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for more information regarding our stock repurchase programs. We had no retirements of treasury stock in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014.\nIn May 2015, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the Bank\u201d). The Credit Agreement amended and restated our prior credit agreement, dated as of May 2011. The Credit Agreement provides for a $100.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility to augment our financial flexibility. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are required to be guaranteed by the Company's domestic subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions.\nIn May 2016, we executed a First Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and Limited Waiver (the Amended Credit Agreement\u201d). The Amended Credit Agreement extends the term of the Credit Agreement by one year to May 9, 2019, and waives a default under the Credit Agreement in effect as of March 31, 2016 in which our debt to EBITDA ratio minimally exceeded the previously agreed upon ratio of 3:1. The breach of the covenant was primarily a result of our restructuring activities in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2016.\nRevolving loans under the Amended Credit Agreement will bear interest, at our election, at (i) the Bank's announced prime rate less 1.20% per annum or (ii) a daily one-month LIBOR rate plus 1.40% per annum. Principal, together with all accrued and unpaid interest, on the revolving loans is due and payable on May 9, 2019. The Company is also obligated to pay a commitment fee of 0.37% per annum on the average daily unused amount of the revolving line of credit, which fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears. The Company may prepay the loans and terminate the commitments under the Amended Credit Agreement at any time, without premium or penalty, subject to the reimbursement of certain costs. As of March 31, 2016 the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the line of credit. The line of credit requires us to comply with the following two financial covenant ratios, in each case at each fiscal quarter end and determined on a rolling four-quarter basis:\n \u2022 maximum ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"); and, \n \u2022 minimum EBITDA coverage ratio, which is calculated as interest payments divided by EBITDA. \nIn addition, we and our subsidiaries are required to maintain unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities plus availability under the Amended Credit Agreement at the end of each fiscal quarter of at least $300.0 million. The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary events of default that include, among other things, payment defaults, covenant defaults, cross-defaults with certain other indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults, and judgment defaults. The occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of the obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement. As of March 31, 2016, we were in breach of our debt to EBITDA ratio covenant but in compliance with all other ratios and covenants by a substantial margin.\nOn May 2, 2016, we received a waiver from the lender for noncompliance with the minimum EBITDA covenant at March 31, 2016. Pursuant to the terms of the waiver and amendment to the Credit Agreement, the $16.2 million of restructuring charges recorded in our fiscal year 2016 will be excluded from the lender's rolling four-quarter EBITDA calculation. This exclusion of restructuring charges does not automatically extend to any such future charges, should they be incurred.\nThis breach is not considered to be a cross-default on our 5.50% Senior Notes and as such has no impact on the amount or timing of amounts payable related to these debt instruments.\nOur liquidity, capital resources, and results of operations in any period could be affected by repurchases of our common stock, the payment of cash dividends, the exercise of outstanding stock options, restricted stock grants under stock plans, and the issuance of common stock under our ESPP. We receive cash from the exercise of outstanding stock options under our stock plan and the issuance of shares under our ESPP. However, the resulting increase in the number of outstanding shares from these equity grants and issuances could affect our earnings per share. We cannot predict the timing or amount of proceeds from the sale or exercise of these securities or whether they will be exercised, forfeited, canceled, or will expire.\nWe believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash provided by operations, and the availability of additional funds under the Amended Credit Agreement will be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next 12 months; however, any projections of future financial needs and sources of working capital are subject to uncertainty. Readers are cautioned to review the risks, uncertainties, and assumptions set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the sections entitled Certain Forward-Looking Information\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d for factors that could affect our estimates for future financial needs and sources of working capital.\nOFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nWe have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides us with financing and liquidity support, market risk, or credit risk support.\nA substantial portion of the raw materials, components, and subassemblies used in our products are provided by our suppliers on a consignment basis. These consigned inventories are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet until we take title to the raw materials, components, and subassemblies, which occurs when they are consumed in the production process. Prior to consumption in the production process, our suppliers bear the risk of loss and retain title to the consigned inventory. The terms of the agreements allow the Company to return parts in excess of maximum order quantities to the suppliers at the supplier's expense. Returns for other reasons are negotiated with the suppliers on a case-by-case basis and to date have been immaterial. If our suppliers were to discontinue financing consigned inventory, it would require us to make cash outlays and we could incur expenses which, if material, could negatively affect our business and financial results. As of March 31, 2016 and 2015, we had off-balance sheet consigned inventories of $41.1 million and $33.4 million, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes our future contractual obligations as of March 31, 2016 and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:\n\nOperating Leases\nWe lease certain facilities under operating leases expiring through our fiscal year 2026. Certain of these leases provide for renewal options for periods ranging from one to three years and in the normal course of business, we may exercise the renewal options.\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nWe utilize several contract manufacturers to manufacture raw materials, components, and subassemblies for our products. We provide these contract manufacturers with demand information that typically covers periods up to 13 weeks, and they use this information to acquire components and build products. We also obtain individual components for our products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, we acquire components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. As of March 31, 2016, we had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of $150.9 million, all of which we expect to consume in the normal course of business.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nAs of March 31, 2016, long-term income taxes payable reported on our consolidated balance sheet included unrecognized tax benefits and related interest of $12.7 million and $1.6 million, respectively. We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to unrecognized tax benefits and they are not included in the contractual obligations table above. We do not anticipate any material cash payments associated with our unrecognized tax benefits to be made within the next twelve months.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"). In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends, future expectations and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On an ongoing basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require our most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee.\n \u2022 Revenue Recognition and Related Allowances \n \u2022 Inventory Valuation \n \u2022 Product Warranty Obligations \n \u2022 Income Taxes \nRevenue Recognition and Related Allowances\nWe sell substantially all of our products to end users through distributors, retailers, and carriers. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonable assured. For most of the Company's product sales, these criteria are met at either the time the product is shipped or the customer has received the product. Commercial distributors and retailers represent our largest sources of net revenues. Sales through our distribution and retail channels are made primarily under agreements allowing for rights of return and include various sales incentive programs, such as rebates, advertising, price protection, and other sales incentives. We have an established sales history for these arrangements and we record the estimated reserves and allowances at the time the related revenue is recognized. Customer sales returns are estimated based on historical data, relevant current data, and the monitoring of inventory build-up in the distribution channel.\nThe primary factors affecting our reserve for estimated customer sales returns include the general timing of historical returns and estimated return rates. The allowance for sales incentive programs is based on contractual terms and historical experience in the form of payments or sell-through credits redeemed by our customers. Future market conditions or an evaluation of partner incentives may lead us to increase customer incentive offerings, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue.\nWe have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to measure sales return reserves or incentive allowances during the past three fiscal years. Substantially all credits associated with these activities are processed within the following fiscal year, and therefore, do not require subjective long-term estimates; however, if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. If we increased our estimate as of March 31, 2016 by a hypothetical 10%, our sales returns reserve and sales incentive allowance would have increased by approximately $0.7 million and $1.2 million, respectively. Net of the estimated value of the inventory that would be returned, this would have decreased gross profit and net income by approximately $4.0 million and $3.3 million, respectively.\nWhen a sales arrangement contains multiple elements, such as hardware and software products and/or services, we allocate revenue to each element based on relative selling prices. The selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor specific objective evidence (\"VSOE\"), if available, third party evidence (\"TPE\") if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price (\"ESP\") if neither VSOE nor TPE are available. In multiple element arrangements where more-than-incidental software deliverables are included, we allocate revenue to each separate unit of accounting for each of the non-software deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. Revenue recognized for the software portion of multiple element arrangements was less than 1% of total net revenues for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015. As of March 31, 2016 and 2015, total deferred revenue related to the software portion of multiple-element arrangements was $2.7 million and $2.0 million, respectively.\nInventory Valuation\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. The Company writes down inventories that have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. Our estimate of write downs for excess and obsolete inventory is based on a detailed analysis of on-hand inventory and purchase commitments in excess of forecasted demand. Our products require long-lead time parts available from a limited number of vendors and, occasionally, last-time buys of raw materials for products with long lifecycles. The effects of demand variability, long-lead times, and last-time buys have historically contributed to inventory write-downs. Our demand forecast considers projected future shipments, market conditions, inventory on hand, purchase commitments, product development plans and product life cycle, inventory on consignment, and other competitive factors. Refer to \"Off Balance Sheet Arrangements\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details regarding consigned inventories.\nWe have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to estimate our inventory write-downs or adverse purchase commitments during the past three fiscal years. If the demand or market conditions for our products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of our inventory, we may be required to record additional inventory write-downs or adverse purchase commitments, which would negatively affect our results of operations in the period the write-downs or adverse purchase commitments were recorded. If we increased our inventory reserve and adverse purchase commitment reserve estimates as of March 31, 2016 by a hypothetical 10%, the reserves and cost of revenues would have each increased by approximately $0.4 million and our net income would have been reduced by approximately $0.4 million.\nProduct Warranty Obligations\nThe Company records a liability for the estimated costs of warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. Factors that affect the warranty obligation include historical and projected product failure rates, estimated return rates, material usage, service related costs incurred in correcting product failure claims, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company's typical experience. If actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. If we increased our warranty obligation estimate as of March 31, 2016 by a hypothetical 10%, our obligation and the associated cost of revenues would have each increased by approximately $0.9 million and our net income would have been reduced by approximately $0.6 million.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions and our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits may include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years may be subject to audit by various tax authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a liability for such exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a liability is audited and fully resolved or clarified.\nTo the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would generally require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.\nWe recognize the impact of an uncertain income tax position on income tax expense at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained. An unrecognized tax benefit will not be recognized unless it has a greater than 50% likelihood of being sustained. We adjust our tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position, or when more information becomes available. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions.\nOur provision for income taxes does not include provisions for U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign operations that we intend to reinvest indefinitely in the foreign operations. If these earnings were distributed to the U.S. in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes, subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits, and foreign withholding taxes. Our current plans do not require repatriation of earnings from foreign operations to fund the U.S. operations because we generate sufficient domestic operating cash flow and have access to external funding under our line of credit. As a result, we do not expect a material impact on our business or financial flexibility with respect to undistributed earnings of our foreign operations.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRecently Issued Pronouncements\nIn March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued additional guidance regarding share-based compensation, which outlines new provisions intended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for share-based payments and their presentation in the financial statements. The guidance is effective our fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect this new accounting guidance may have on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued additional guidance regarding both operating and financing leases, requiring lessees to recognize on their balance sheets right-of-use assets\u201d and corresponding lease liabilities, measured on a discounted basis over the lease term. Virtually all leases will be subject to this treatment except leases that meet the definition of a short-term lease.\u201d For expense recognition, the dual model requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance leases has been retained from the prior standard. Operating leases will result in straight-line expense while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern. Classification will use criteria very similar to those applied in current lease accounting, but without explicit bright lines. Extensive additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures, including significant judgments made by management, will be required to provide greater insight into the extent of expense recognized and expected to be recognized.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis is intended to help you understand our results of operations and financial condition. It is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please see the sections entitled \"Certain Forward Looking Information\" and \"Risk Factors\" above for discussions of the uncertainties, risks, and assumptions associated with these statements. Our fiscal year-end financial reporting periods end on the Saturday closest to March 31st. Fiscal year 2016 had 53 weeks and ended on April 2, 2016, fiscal years 2015 and 2014 each had 52 weeks and ended on March 28, 2015, and March 29, 2014, respectively. For purposes of presentation, we have indicated our accounting fiscal year as ending on March 31.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a leading designer, manufacturer, and marketer of lightweight communications headsets, telephone headset systems, other communication endpoints, and accessories for the worldwide business and consumer markets under the Plantronics brand. In addition, we manufacture and market specialty telephone products under our Clarity brand, such as telephones for the hearing impaired, and other related products for people with special communication needs. Our major product categories are Enterprise, which includes headsets optimized for Unified Communications ( UC\u201d), other corded and cordless communication headsets, audio processors, and telephone systems; and Consumer, which includes Bluetooth and corded products for mobile device applications, personal computer (\"PC\") and gaming headsets, and specialty products marketed for hearing impaired individuals.\nCompared to the prior year, net revenues decreased 0.9% to $856.9 million. The decrease in net revenues was driven by lower revenues within our Consumer product category, which declined 6.3% from the prior year. This decline was partially offset by slight growth in our Enterprise product category, which increased 1.2% from the prior year. While our primary driver of revenue growth continues to be revenues from the sale of our UC products, our fiscal year 2016 Consumer revenues were negatively impacted by $22 million due to the rapid decline of the U.S. market for mono Bluetooth headsets. However, we believe we grew our market share in this category, which helped to partially offset the decline. Our fiscal year 2016 revenues were also negatively impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Compared to the other foreign currencies in which we sell, a stronger U.S. Dollar (\"USD\") decreased net revenues by approximately $27 million, net of the effects of hedging, in our fiscal year 2016 compared to the prior year.\nOperating profit decreased 27.5% to $108.0 million, due primarily to restructuring charges taken during fiscal year 2016, the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and the impact of a non-recurring, favorable litigation settlement in fiscal year 2015. The adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted our net revenues but favorably impacted our operating expenses, although to a lesser degree, for a net unfavorable impact of $11 million to our operating profit. These items were partially offset by a reduction in variable compensation expense due to lower profitability. We delivered $68.4 million in net income, representing approximately 8.0% of our net revenues.\nWe generate approximately 40% to 45% of our revenues from international sales; therefore, the impact of currency movements on our net revenues can be significant. In addition, in some international locations where we sell in USD, we also face additional pricing pressure, discounting, and lost business as the stronger dollar negatively impacts buying decisions. Unfavorable impacts from the global economy and consumer spending together with exchange rate fluctuations could continue to negatively impact our net revenues in our fiscal year 2017. We continually work to offset currency movements through hedging strategies designed to minimize the volatility of results and dampen large fluctuations. However, as our revenue hedging instruments cover a period of up to 12 months, the hedging conducted a year ago is expected to deliver little benefit to offset the stronger dollar against other major currencies in fiscal year 2017.\nRevenues from our Consumer products channel are seasonal and typically strongest in our third fiscal quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season. Additionally, other factors directly impact our Consumer product category performance, such as consumer preferences, changes in consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors, product life-cycles (including the introduction and pace of adoption of new technology), and the competitive retail environment. Our Consumer business continues to be impacted by a decline in sales volumes in our mono Bluetooth products as the market for these products contracts. The unit volumes in our stereo Bluetooth category increased slightly when compared to the prior fiscal year, driven primarily by our newer generation of products. We anticipate that these newer products and other planned investments in the Consumer category will allow us to better compete in these consumer product categories as they continue to expand. While we have been building our stereo portfolio over the last several years, it is not yet as robust as our mono Bluetooth portfolio of products. As a result of these market changes, we have reduced the amount we expect to invest in non-premium mono Bluetooth portfolio while shifting that investment toward additional stereo Bluetooth products. This shift toward entertainment solutions is important to our long-term brand position.\nDue to slower than anticipated growth of UC revenues, combined with the negative impact of a strengthening dollar, and a sharp decrease in the U.S. mono Bluetooth market, our fiscal year 2016 revenues declined year over year, causing us to make some necessary changes to reduce our cost structure. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 we initiated a restructuring plan to better align expenses to our revenue and gross margin profile and position us for improved operating performance. Under that plan, we reduced costs through voluntary and involuntary elimination of certain positions throughout the organization in the U.S., Mexico, China, and Europe. The restructuring actions have resulted in pre-tax charges of approximately $16.2 million in our fiscal year 2016.\nLooking forward to fiscal year 2017, UC continues to be our primary focus area. With the vast majority of the UC opportunity still ahead of us, we believe we are in the beginning stage of a potentially long period of growth. We believe UC represents our key long-term driver of revenue and profit growth, as we anticipate UC systems will become more commonly adopted by enterprises to reduce costs and improve collaboration. We believe growth of UC will increase overall headset adoption in enterprise environments, and we expect most of the growth in our Enterprise product category over the next five years to come from headsets designed for UC.\nIn addition, in fiscal year 2017 we are expecting to launch new peripheral \"as-a-service\" offerings which we anticipate will complement our existing suite of product offerings as we move toward a hybrid business model of hardware, software, and services. We believe these enhanced offerings will allow us to expand the reach of our solutions portfolio and scale for growth. Our aim is to simplify our customers' experience and drive a baseline of experiences across our portfolio. During our fiscal year 2017, we will strive to transform data into actionable insights for our customers through software solutions that will offer reporting on asset management, usage, and conversation/acoustic health. In order to achieve these objectives, we will redefine our sales and marketing relationships and harmonize goals across these organizations to ensure we are working toward the same shared vision and go-to-market strategy.\nWe remain cautious about the macroeconomic environment, based on uncertainty around fiscal policy in the U.S., as well as broader economic uncertainty in many parts of Europe and Asia Pacific, which makes it difficult for us to gauge what impact the economy may have on our future business, and the fact that the UC opportunity has not matured as quickly as we initially anticipated. We will continue to monitor our expenditures and prioritize expenditures that further our strategic long-term growth opportunities such as innovative product development in our core research and development efforts, including the use of software and services as part of our portfolio. UC will also remain the central focus of our sales force, marketing group, and other customer service and support teams as we continue investing in key strategic alliances and integrations with major UC vendors.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the consolidated statements of operations data.

Net revenues may vary due to seasonality, the timing of new product introductions and discontinuation of existing products, discounts and other incentives, and channel mix. Net revenues derived from sales of Consumer products into the retail channel typically account for a seasonal increase in net revenues in the third quarter of our fiscal year.\nOur net revenues decreased in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 due largely to a decline in Consumer revenues, which was mainly attributable to the shrinking mono Bluetooth market. This decline was partially offset by slight growth in our Enterprise revenues driven by an increase in demand for UC products resulting from continued adoption of UC voice solutions in the marketplace, partially offset by a slight decline in Core Enterprise (non-UC products).\nA stronger U.S. Dollar (\"USD\") compared to the other foreign currencies in which we sell decreased net revenues by approximately $27 million, net of the effects of hedging, in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015. We generate approximately 44% of our revenues from international sales; therefore, the impact of currency movements on our net revenues can be significant. In fiscal year 2017, our revenues may continue to be affected by uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending.\nOur net revenues increased in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 due largely to growth in Enterprise revenues, which was mainly attributable to growth in demand for UC products driven by continued adoption of UC voice solutions in the marketplace. Growth in our net revenues from Consumer products was the result of continued success in the market of key products such as our Voyager Legend mono Bluetooth headset and our Backbeat GO2 and BackBeat FIT stereo Bluetooth headsets. In addition, we successfully introduced Voyager Edge and Backbeat PRO during our fiscal year 2015, driving incremental sales. Partly offsetting these increases were reductions in revenue from our PC and Entertainment product line as our portfolio was awaiting a refresh which began in fiscal year 2016. A stronger U.S. Dollar (\"USD\") compared to the other foreign currencies in which we sell decreased net revenues by approximately $5 million, net of the effects of hedging, in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014.\nGeographic Information\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>475,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>487,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>487,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>482,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,985\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percentage of net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe and Africa\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>195,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>213,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>213,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>217,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia Pacific\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Americas, excluding United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,907\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.4)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total international net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>343,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>377,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>377,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>374,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,118\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.8)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percentage of net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>818,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>865,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>865,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>856,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8,103\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.9)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs a percentage of total net revenues, U.S. net revenues decreased slightly compared with international revenues in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015. The decrease in absolute dollars in U.S. net revenues was driven primarily by weaker Consumer revenues primarily as a result of the declining mono Bluetooth market, which was partially offset by increased Enterprise net revenues due to continued growth in demand for UC. The decrease in absolute dollars in international revenues was due primarily to decreased Core Enterprise net revenues, partially offset by higher UC and Consumer revenues. International revenues were reduced by approximately $27 million, net of the effects of hedging, in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015, due to unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations in the other foreign currencies in which we sell.\nAs a percentage of total net revenues, U.S. net revenues decreased slightly compared with international revenues in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. The increase in absolute dollars in U.S. net revenues was driven primarily by increased Enterprise net revenues due to continued growth in demand for UC and stronger Consumer revenues as a result of a refreshed and enhanced next generation product portfolio. The increase in absolute dollars in international revenues was due primarily to increased Enterprise net revenues reflecting continued growth in demand for UC products and, to a lesser extent, higher Consumer revenues. International revenues were reduced by approximately $5 million, net of the effects of hedging, in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014, due to unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations in the other foreign currencies in which we sell.\nCost of Revenues and Gross Profit\nCost of revenues consists primarily of direct manufacturing and contract manufacturer costs, warranty expense, freight expense, depreciation, duty expense, reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, royalties, and an allocation of overhead expenses, including facilities, IT, and human resources costs.\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>818,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>865,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>865,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>856,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8,103\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>391,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>403,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>403,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>422,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>426,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>461,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>461,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>434,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(26,945\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCompared to the prior year, gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal year 2016 due primarily to the weakening of foreign currencies relative to the USD, which negatively impacted margins on our international product sales. Gross profit was further negatively impacted by a lower mix of Core Enterprise sales, which carry higher margins than our UC and Consumer categories.\nCompared to the prior year, gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased in fiscal year 2015 due primarily to reductions in product costs and higher revenues from next-generation mobile products carrying better margins. These favorable impacts were offset in part by the following: (i) a shift in product mix from Enterprise to Consumer; (ii) within Enterprise, the continued ramp in UC, which carries lower margins than our non-UC Enterprise products; and (iii) non-recurrence of a favorable adjustment made in fiscal year 2014 to correct an immaterial error related to our warranty and sales returns reserves.\nThere are significant variances in gross profit percentages between our higher and lower margin products; therefore, small variations in product mix, which can be difficult to predict, can have a significant impact on gross profit. Gross profit may also vary based on distribution channel, return rates, and other factors.\nResearch, Development, and Engineering\nResearch, development, and engineering costs are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of compensation costs, outside services, including legal fees associated with protecting our intellectual property, expensed materials, depreciation, and an allocation of overhead expenses, including facilities, IT, and human resources costs.\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research, development and engineering\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,219\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% of total net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in research, development, and engineering expenses in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was due primarily to a reduction in variable compensation associated with lower profitability and a favorable impact due to foreign currency fluctuations .

These decreases were partially offset by higher equity-based compensation expense resulting from the shorter vesting schedule of restricted stock grants made after May 2013 compared to restricted stock grants made prior to May 2013, and an increase in bad debt expense related to RadioShack's bankruptcy proceedings.\nThe increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was due primarily to $13.5 million in higher headcount-related costs resulting from higher performance-based compensation reflecting higher net revenues and higher overall achievement against targets, including an increase to equity-based compensation resulting from the shorter vesting schedule of restricted stock grants made after May 2013 compared to restricted stock grants made prior to May 2013. We also experienced an increase of $3.3 million in depreciation and $7.1 million in higher legal expenses, driven mainly by ongoing litigation.\nGain from Litigation Settlements\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 we recognized gains of approximately $1.2 million, net of immaterial legal contingency fees, within operating income. These gains were primarily the result of net receipts of $0.8 million from a competitor to dismiss litigation involving the alleged infringement of a patent assigned to us as well as miscellaneous immaterial settlements with other parties.\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 we recognized gains of approximately $8.7 million, net of immaterial legal contingency fees, within operating income. These gains were the result of net receipts of $6.5 million from a competitor to dismiss litigation involving the alleged infringement of a patent assigned to us and $2.2 million related to the resolution of an insurance coverage dispute with one of our insurance carriers.

This measure was taken as a part of a broader effort to optimize the organization around our long-term strategic initiatives while adjusting for current macroeconomic business conditions and involved the reduction of approximately 125 positions. These staff reductions were substantially complete by the end of fiscal year 2016.\nIn connection with this plan, we have recorded pre-tax charges of approximately $16.2 million, consisting of severance and related benefits. These charges were offset by a reduction in our fiscal year 2016 stock-based compensation expense of $1.5 million attributable to stock award forfeitures resulting from the restructuring action. Projected annual saving from this plan are in the range of approximately $15 to $16 million and will enable us to reduce our cost structure to better support our long-term profitability targets and maintain our competitiveness. See Note 11, Restructuring and Other Related Charges, of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information on restructuring costs.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense of $25.1 million for fiscal year 2016, was primarily related to the 5.50% Senior Notes and included $1.2 million in amortization of debt issuance costs.

A retroactive and permanent reinstatement of the federal research credit was signed into law on December 18, 2015. As such, our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 includes the benefit of one quarter of credits for fiscal year 2015 plus the tax benefit for the fiscal year 2016 tax credit.\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal year 2015 is higher than the previous year due primarily to the absence of several one-time, discrete items that benefited the tax rate in the previous year, such as the generation of a foreign tax credit carryover, changes in Mexican tax law that resulted in the reversal of a valuation allowance, and a deduction for qualifying domestic production activities. These factors were offset by a higher proportion of income earned in foreign jurisdictions that is taxed at lower rates and by an increase in the benefit from the U.S. federal research tax credit. Our fiscal year 2015 included four quarters of benefit from the U.S. federal research tax credit because the credit expired on December 31, 2014 but was retroactively reinstated in January 2015. In contrast, during our fiscal year 2014, the credit was only available for three quarters as the credit expired December 31, 2013 and was not renewed.\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014 differs from the statutory rate due to the impact of foreign operations taxed at different statutory rates, income tax credits, state taxes, and other factors. Our future tax rate could be impacted by a shift in the mix of domestic and foreign income, tax treaties with foreign jurisdictions, changes in tax laws in the U.S. or internationally, or a change in estimate of future taxable income, which could result in a valuation allowance being required.\nWe had $12.7 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of March 31, 2016 compared to $12.8 million and $12.6 million as of March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The unrecognized tax benefits as of the end of fiscal year 2016 would favorably impact the effective tax rate in future periods, if recognized.\nIt is our continuing practice to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. As of March 31, 2016, we had approximately $1.6 million of accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions, compared to $1.8 million and $1.7 million as of March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. No penalties have been accrued.\nThe liability for uncertain tax positions may be reduced for liabilities that are settled with taxing authorities or on which the statute of limitations could expire without assessment from tax authorities. Currently, we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of reductions, if any, during the next twelve months.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to taxation in various foreign and state jurisdictions, including the U.S. All federal tax matters have been concluded for tax years prior to fiscal year 2013. The California Franchise Tax Board completed its examination of our 2007 and 2008 tax years. The Company received a Notice of Proposed Assessment and responded by filing a protest letter. The amount of the proposed assessment is not material. Foreign income tax matters for material tax jurisdictions have been concluded for tax years prior to fiscal year 2011, except for the United Kingdom, which has been concluded for tax years prior to fiscal year 2015.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for each of the past three fiscal years:\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash provided by (used for):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>154,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>146,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,947\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,569\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(57,971\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,566\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(131,600\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,405\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(110,034\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(80,534\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(85,218\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(56,697\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,684\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,508\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(156\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,450\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(41,584\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe use cash provided by operating activities as our primary source of liquidity. We expect that cash provided by operating activities will fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our revenues, the timing of product shipments during the quarter, accounts receivable collections, inventory and supply chain management, and the timing and amount of tax and other payments.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the year ended March 31, 2016 decreased from the prior year due primarily to lower net income after adjusting for non-cash items - predominantly the remeasurement of our non-designated hedge instruments, stock-based compensation, non-cash restructuring charges, and depreciation/amortization. These items were partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable, and an increase in accounts payable both driven by a shorter cash conversion cycle.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the year ended March 31, 2015 increased from the prior year due primarily to higher net income after adjusting for non-cash items, predominantly stock-based compensation and depreciation, a decrease in accounts receivable, and an increase in accounts payable both due to improved working capital management. These items were partially offset by increase in current assets related to participant deferrals as part of our deferred compensation plan. Please refer to Note 5, Deferred Compensation of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for more information regarding our deferred compensation plan.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used for investing activities during the year ended March 31, 2016 increased from the year ended March 31, 2015 due to an increase in the net purchases of investments and an increase in capital expenditures.\nNet cash used for investing activities during the year ended March 31, 2015 decreased from the year ended March 31, 2014 due to a decrease in capital expenditures and an increase in the net cash received from sales of investments. Cash used for investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2015 does not include approximately $2.1 million of capital expenditures as the corresponding accruals were included within accounts payable at March 31, 2015 and therefore did not have an impact on cash flows for the period.\nWe anticipate our capital expenditures in fiscal year 2017 to be approximately $25.0 million to $30.0 million, related to costs associated with the purchase and related construction of a new smarter working office for our European headquarters in the Netherlands as well as costs associated with building and leasehold improvements at our U.S. headquarters, the implementation of a manufacturing execution system at our facility in Mexico, and other IT-related expenditures. The remainder of the anticipated capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 consist primarily of capital investment in our manufacturing capabilities, including tooling for new products. We will continue to evaluate new business opportunities and new markets; as a result, our future growth within the existing business or new opportunities and markets may dictate the need for additional facilities and capital expenditures to support that growth.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used for financing activities during the year ended March 31, 2016 decreased from the year ended March 31, 2015 primarily driven by net proceeds received from issuance of the 5.50% Senior Notes partially offset by an increase in the level of common stock repurchases.\nNet cash used for financing activities during the year ended March 31, 2015 increased from the year ended March 31, 2014 due to an increase in the level of common stock repurchases and an increase in our quarterly dividend beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2015. These items were partially offset by an increase in proceeds from our revolving line of credit.\nOn May 3, 2016, we announced that our Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (\"the Audit Committee\") had declared a cash dividend of $0.15 per share of our common stock, payable on June 10, 2016 to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 20, 2016. We expect to continue paying a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share of our common stock; however, the actual declaration of dividends and the establishment of record and payment dates are subject to final determination by the Audit Committee each quarter after its review of our financial performance and financial position.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary discretionary cash uses have historically been for repurchases of our common stock and dividend payments. At March 31, 2016, we had working capital of $487.8 million, including $395.3 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, compared to working capital of $507.8 million, including $374.7 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at March 31, 2015. The decrease in working capital at March 31, 2016 compared to March 31, 2015 results from the decrease in accounts receivable and increase in accounts payable both due primarily to improved working capital management.\nOur cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2016 consist of bank deposits with third party financial institutions, Commercial Paper, and Corporate Bonds. We monitor bank balances in our operating accounts and adjust the balances as appropriate. Cash balances are held throughout the world, including substantial amounts held outside of the U.S. As of March 31, 2016, of our $395.3 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, $40.9 million is held domestically while $354.4 million is held by foreign subsidiaries, approximately 90% of which were based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. The costs to repatriate our foreign earnings to the U.S. would likely be material; however, our intent is to indefinitely reinvest our earnings from foreign operations, and our current plans do not require us to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations as we generate sufficient domestic operating cash flow and have access to external funding under our current revolving line of credit. Our investments are intended to establish a high-quality portfolio that preserves principal and meets liquidity needs. As of March 31, 2016, our investments are composed of Mutual Funds, US Treasury Notes, Government Agency Securities, Commercial Paper, Corporate Bonds, and Certificates of Deposits (\"CDs\").\nFrom time to time, our Board of Directors (\"the Board\") authorizes programs under which we may repurchase shares of our common stock, depending on market conditions, in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, including accelerated stock repurchase agreements. The following table summarizes our repurchase of common stock as part of these publicly announced repurchase programs as well as shares withheld in satisfaction of employee tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock granted under our stock plans:\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions except share data)\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repurchase of common stock:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shares\n</td> <td>1,949,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,221,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,077,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>112.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>497.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employees' tax withheld and paid for restricted stock and restricted stock units:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shares\n</td> <td>138,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of March 31, 2016, there remained a total of 634,011 shares authorized for repurchase under the stock repurchase program approved by the Board on January 29, 2016. Refer to Note 12, Common Stock Repurchases, of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for more information regarding our stock repurchase programs. We had no retirements of treasury stock in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014.\nIn May 2015, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the Bank\u201d). The Credit Agreement amended and restated our prior credit agreement, dated as of May 2011. The Credit Agreement provides for a $100.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility to augment our financial flexibility. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are required to be guaranteed by the Company's domestic subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions.\nIn May 2016, we executed a First Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and Limited Waiver (the Amended Credit Agreement\u201d). The Amended Credit Agreement extends the term of the Credit Agreement by one year to May 9, 2019, and waives a default under the Credit Agreement in effect as of March 31, 2016 in which our debt to EBITDA ratio minimally exceeded the previously agreed upon ratio of 3:1. The breach of the covenant was primarily a result of our restructuring activities in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2016.\nRevolving loans under the Amended Credit Agreement will bear interest, at our election, at (i) the Bank's announced prime rate less 1.20% per annum or (ii) a daily one-month LIBOR rate plus 1.40% per annum. Principal, together with all accrued and unpaid interest, on the revolving loans is due and payable on May 9, 2019. The Company is also obligated to pay a commitment fee of 0.37% per annum on the average daily unused amount of the revolving line of credit, which fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears. The Company may prepay the loans and terminate the commitments under the Amended Credit Agreement at any time, without premium or penalty, subject to the reimbursement of certain costs. As of March 31, 2016 the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the line of credit. The line of credit requires us to comply with the following two financial covenant ratios, in each case at each fiscal quarter end and determined on a rolling four-quarter basis:\n \u2022 maximum ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"); and, \n \u2022 minimum EBITDA coverage ratio, which is calculated as interest payments divided by EBITDA. \nIn addition, we and our subsidiaries are required to maintain unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities plus availability under the Amended Credit Agreement at the end of each fiscal quarter of at least $300.0 million. The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary events of default that include, among other things, payment defaults, covenant defaults, cross-defaults with certain other indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults, and judgment defaults. The occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of the obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement. As of March 31, 2016, we were in breach of our debt to EBITDA ratio covenant but in compliance with all other ratios and covenants by a substantial margin.\nOn May 2, 2016, we received a waiver from the lender for noncompliance with the minimum EBITDA covenant at March 31, 2016. Pursuant to the terms of the waiver and amendment to the Credit Agreement, the $16.2 million of restructuring charges recorded in our fiscal year 2016 will be excluded from the lender's rolling four-quarter EBITDA calculation. This exclusion of restructuring charges does not automatically extend to any such future charges, should they be incurred.\nThis breach is not considered to be a cross-default on our 5.50% Senior Notes and as such has no impact on the amount or timing of amounts payable related to these debt instruments.\nOur liquidity, capital resources, and results of operations in any period could be affected by repurchases of our common stock, the payment of cash dividends, the exercise of outstanding stock options, restricted stock grants under stock plans, and the issuance of common stock under our ESPP. We receive cash from the exercise of outstanding stock options under our stock plan and the issuance of shares under our ESPP. However, the resulting increase in the number of outstanding shares from these equity grants and issuances could affect our earnings per share. We cannot predict the timing or amount of proceeds from the sale or exercise of these securities or whether they will be exercised, forfeited, canceled, or will expire.\nWe believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash provided by operations, and the availability of additional funds under the Amended Credit Agreement will be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next 12 months; however, any projections of future financial needs and sources of working capital are subject to uncertainty. Readers are cautioned to review the risks, uncertainties, and assumptions set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the sections entitled Certain Forward-Looking Information\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d for factors that could affect our estimates for future financial needs and sources of working capital.\nOFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nWe have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides us with financing and liquidity support, market risk, or credit risk support.\nA substantial portion of the raw materials, components, and subassemblies used in our products are provided by our suppliers on a consignment basis. These consigned inventories are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet until we take title to the raw materials, components, and subassemblies, which occurs when they are consumed in the production process. Prior to consumption in the production process, our suppliers bear the risk of loss and retain title to the consigned inventory. The terms of the agreements allow the Company to return parts in excess of maximum order quantities to the suppliers at the supplier's expense. Returns for other reasons are negotiated with the suppliers on a case-by-case basis and to date have been immaterial. If our suppliers were to discontinue financing consigned inventory, it would require us to make cash outlays and we could incur expenses which, if material, could negatively affect our business and financial results. As of March 31, 2016 and 2015, we had off-balance sheet consigned inventories of $41.1 million and $33.4 million, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes our future contractual obligations as of March 31, 2016 and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unconditional purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>145,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long term debt (5.50% Senior Notes)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>707,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>569,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>867,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>175,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>571,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Leases\nWe lease certain facilities under operating leases expiring through our fiscal year 2026. Certain of these leases provide for renewal options for periods ranging from one to three years and in the normal course of business, we may exercise the renewal options.\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nWe utilize several contract manufacturers to manufacture raw materials, components, and subassemblies for our products. We provide these contract manufacturers with demand information that typically covers periods up to 13 weeks, and they use this information to acquire components and build products. We also obtain individual components for our products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, we acquire components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. As of March 31, 2016, we had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of $150.9 million, all of which we expect to consume in the normal course of business.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nAs of March 31, 2016, long-term income taxes payable reported on our consolidated balance sheet included unrecognized tax benefits and related interest of $12.7 million and $1.6 million, respectively. We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to unrecognized tax benefits and they are not included in the contractual obligations table above. We do not anticipate any material cash payments associated with our unrecognized tax benefits to be made within the next twelve months.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"). In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends, future expectations and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On an ongoing basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require our most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee.\n \u2022 Revenue Recognition and Related Allowances \n \u2022 Inventory Valuation \n \u2022 Product Warranty Obligations \n \u2022 Income Taxes \nRevenue Recognition and Related Allowances\nWe sell substantially all of our products to end users through distributors, retailers, and carriers. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonable assured. For most of the Company's product sales, these criteria are met at either the time the product is shipped or the customer has received the product. Commercial distributors and retailers represent our largest sources of net revenues. Sales through our distribution and retail channels are made primarily under agreements allowing for rights of return and include various sales incentive programs, such as rebates, advertising, price protection, and other sales incentives. We have an established sales history for these arrangements and we record the estimated reserves and allowances at the time the related revenue is recognized. Customer sales returns are estimated based on historical data, relevant current data, and the monitoring of inventory build-up in the distribution channel.\nThe primary factors affecting our reserve for estimated customer sales returns include the general timing of historical returns and estimated return rates. The allowance for sales incentive programs is based on contractual terms and historical experience in the form of payments or sell-through credits redeemed by our customers. Future market conditions or an evaluation of partner incentives may lead us to increase customer incentive offerings, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue.\nWe have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to measure sales return reserves or incentive allowances during the past three fiscal years. Substantially all credits associated with these activities are processed within the following fiscal year, and therefore, do not require subjective long-term estimates; however, if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. If we increased our estimate as of March 31, 2016 by a hypothetical 10%, our sales returns reserve and sales incentive allowance would have increased by approximately $0.7 million and $1.2 million, respectively. Net of the estimated value of the inventory that would be returned, this would have decreased gross profit and net income by approximately $4.0 million and $3.3 million, respectively.\nWhen a sales arrangement contains multiple elements, such as hardware and software products and/or services, we allocate revenue to each element based on relative selling prices. The selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor specific objective evidence (\"VSOE\"), if available, third party evidence (\"TPE\") if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price (\"ESP\") if neither VSOE nor TPE are available. In multiple element arrangements where more-than-incidental software deliverables are included, we allocate revenue to each separate unit of accounting for each of the non-software deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. Revenue recognized for the software portion of multiple element arrangements was less than 1% of total net revenues for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015. As of March 31, 2016 and 2015, total deferred revenue related to the software portion of multiple-element arrangements was $2.7 million and $2.0 million, respectively.\nInventory Valuation\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. The Company writes down inventories that have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. Our estimate of write downs for excess and obsolete inventory is based on a detailed analysis of on-hand inventory and purchase commitments in excess of forecasted demand. Our products require long-lead time parts available from a limited number of vendors and, occasionally, last-time buys of raw materials for products with long lifecycles. The effects of demand variability, long-lead times, and last-time buys have historically contributed to inventory write-downs. Our demand forecast considers projected future shipments, market conditions, inventory on hand, purchase commitments, product development plans and product life cycle, inventory on consignment, and other competitive factors. Refer to \"Off Balance Sheet Arrangements\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details regarding consigned inventories.\nWe have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to estimate our inventory write-downs or adverse purchase commitments during the past three fiscal years. If the demand or market conditions for our products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of our inventory, we may be required to record additional inventory write-downs or adverse purchase commitments, which would negatively affect our results of operations in the period the write-downs or adverse purchase commitments were recorded. If we increased our inventory reserve and adverse purchase commitment reserve estimates as of March 31, 2016 by a hypothetical 10%, the reserves and cost of revenues would have each increased by approximately $0.4 million and our net income would have been reduced by approximately $0.4 million.\nProduct Warranty Obligations\nThe Company records a liability for the estimated costs of warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. Factors that affect the warranty obligation include historical and projected product failure rates, estimated return rates, material usage, service related costs incurred in correcting product failure claims, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company's typical experience. If actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. If we increased our warranty obligation estimate as of March 31, 2016 by a hypothetical 10%, our obligation and the associated cost of revenues would have each increased by approximately $0.9 million and our net income would have been reduced by approximately $0.6 million.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions and our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits may include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years may be subject to audit by various tax authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a liability for such exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a liability is audited and fully resolved or clarified.\nTo the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would generally require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.\nWe recognize the impact of an uncertain income tax position on income tax expense at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained. An unrecognized tax benefit will not be recognized unless it has a greater than 50% likelihood of being sustained. We adjust our tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position, or when more information becomes available. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions.\nOur provision for income taxes does not include provisions for U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign operations that we intend to reinvest indefinitely in the foreign operations. If these earnings were distributed to the U.S. in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes, subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits, and foreign withholding taxes. Our current plans do not require repatriation of earnings from foreign operations to fund the U.S. operations because we generate sufficient domestic operating cash flow and have access to external funding under our line of credit. As a result, we do not expect a material impact on our business or financial flexibility with respect to undistributed earnings of our foreign operations.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRecently Issued Pronouncements\nIn March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued additional guidance regarding share-based compensation, which outlines new provisions intended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for share-based payments and their presentation in the financial statements. The guidance is effective our fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect this new accounting guidance may have on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued additional guidance regarding both operating and financing leases, requiring lessees to recognize on their balance sheets right-of-use assets\u201d and corresponding lease liabilities, measured on a discounted basis over the lease term. Virtually all leases will be subject to this treatment except leases that meet the definition of a short-term lease.\u201d For expense recognition, the dual model requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance leases has been retained from the prior standard. Operating leases will result in straight-line expense while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern. Classification will use criteria very similar to those applied in current lease accounting, but without explicit bright lines. Extensive additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures, including significant judgments made by management, will be required to provide greater insight into the extent of expense recognized and expected to be recognized.
