The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from the results suggested by these forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this Form 10-K and Item 1A - Risk Factors. For a list of certain abbreviations or acronyms in this discussion, see Glossary of Terms at the beginning of this Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW OF 2021 RESULTS AND STRATEGIC PERFORMANCE\nThe most important matters on which we focus in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance and allocating our resources include: (i) recurring factors which have significant impacts on operating performance such as: regulatory action, environmental matters, weather and weather-related damage in our service area, customer growth, and the local economy; (ii) our progress on performance improvement and growth strategies designed to maintain high standards in several operating areas (including safety, customer satisfaction, operations, financial and enterprise-wide performance, talent management/people, capital allocation/sustainability and corporate social responsibility) simultaneously; and (iii) our short-term and long-term financial and operating strategies. For a discussion of how we are impacted by regulation and environmental matters, please see Note 2 - Regulatory Matters of the Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2 - Regulatory Matters of the Notes to AES Ohio's Financial Statements and Environmental Matters\u201d in Item 1 - Business.\u201d\nOperational Excellence\nOur objective is to optimize AES Ohio's performance in the U.S. utility industry by focusing on the following areas: safety, operations (reliability and customer satisfaction), financial and enterprise-wide performance (efficiency and cost savings, talent management/people, capital allocation/sustainability and corporate social responsibility). We set and measure these objectives carefully, balancing them in a way and to a degree necessary to ensure a sustainable high level of performance in these areas simultaneously compared to our peers. We monitor our performance in these areas, and where practical and meaningful, compare performance in some areas to peer utilities. Because some of our financial and enterprise-wide performance measures are company-specific performance goals, they are not benchmarked.\nOur safety performance is measured by both leading and lagging metrics. Our leading safety metrics track safety observations, safety meeting engagement and the reporting of non-injury significant injury potential incidents. Our lagging safety metrics track lost workday cases, severity rate, and recordable incidents. We are committed to excellence in safety and have implemented various programs to increase safety awareness and improve work practices.\nAES Ohio measures delivery reliability by Customer Average Interruption Duration Index (\"CAIDI\"), System Average Interruption Duration Index (\"SAIDI\") and System Average Interruption Frequency Index (\"SAIFI\") and benchmarks the reliability metrics against other utilities at both the state and national levels. AES Ohio also measures customer centricity on more of an individual basis by the industry metric of Customers that Experience Multiple Interruption of five or more times ( CEMI-5\u201d). We measure customer satisfaction using Research America Utilities Market Research - Consumer Insight. Monitoring performance in the areas such as competitive rates, operational reliability and customer service supports our ongoing work to deliver reliable service to our customers.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe following review of results of operations compares the results for the year ended December 31, 2021 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Therefore, our retail sales demand is affected by the number of heating and cooling degree-days occurring during a year. Cooling degree-days typically have a more significant effect than heating degree-days since some residential customers do not use electricity to heat their homes. Additionally, our retail revenues are affected by regulated rates and riders, including the changes to our ESP, described in Note 2 - Regulatory Matters of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nHeating and Cooling Degree-days (a)\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>change </td> <td> </td> <td>% change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Actual </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Heating degree-days (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>4,855 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,867 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cooling degree-days (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1,300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,176 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>124 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>30-year average (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Heating-degree days </td> <td> </td> <td>5,434 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cooling-degree days </td> <td> </td> <td>996 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>995 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)Heating and cooling degree-days are a measure of the relative heating or cooling required for a home or business. The heating degrees in a day are calculated as the degrees that the average actual daily temperature is below 65 degrees Fahrenheit. For example, if the average temperature on March 20th was 40 degrees Fahrenheit, the heating degrees for that day would be the 25-degree difference between 65 degrees and 40 degrees. Similarly, cooling degrees in a day are calculated as the degrees that the average actual daily temperature is above 65 degrees Fahrenheit.\n(b)30-year average is computed from observed degree-days in the Dayton area on a trailing 30-year basis.\nDPL's and AES Ohio's electric sales and billed customers were as follows:\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ELECTRIC SALES AND CUSTOMERS (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>DPL and AES Ohio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>change </td> <td> </td> <td>% change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail electric sales (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential </td> <td> </td> <td>5,401 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,330 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.3% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial </td> <td> </td> <td>3,562 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,438 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>124 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.6% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial </td> <td> </td> <td>3,675 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,533 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>142 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Governmental </td> <td> </td> <td>1,179 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,148 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.3% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total retail electric sales </td> <td> </td> <td>13,837 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,468 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>369 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale electric sales (c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>493 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>450 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.6% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total electric sales </td> <td> </td> <td>14,330 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,918 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>412 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Billed electric customers (end of period) </td> <td> </td> <td>534,192 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>530,670 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,522 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.7% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)Electric sales are presented in millions of kWh.\n(b)DPL and AES Ohio retail electric sales represent the total transmission and distribution retail sales for the periods presented.

The increase was primarily the result of a favorable property tax true-up in the prior year, resulting from a new assessment from the state of Ohio.\nDPL - Loss on Disposal of Business\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, DPL recorded a Loss on disposal of business of $4.7 million due to the loss on the transfer of business interests in the Hutchings Coal Station.\nDPL - Interest Expense\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, Interest expense decreased $8.4 million compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily the result of the refinancing of debt at DPL in 2020.\nDPL - Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, DPL recorded a Loss on early extinguishment of debt of $31.7 million primarily due to the make-whole premium payment of $30.8 million related to the redemption of the $380.0 million 7.25% Notes due 2021 in the third quarter of 2020.\nDPL - Income Tax Expense From Continuing Operations\nIncome tax benefit decreased $5.0 million from $5.5 million in 2020 to $0.5 million in 2021. The decrease of $5.0 million was primarily due to income from continuing operations before income tax, less the reversal of excess deferred items, in the current year as compared to a loss from continuing operations before income tax, less the reversal of excess deferred items, in the prior year.\nDPL - Discontinued Operations\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, DPL recorded income / (loss) from discontinued operations (net of tax) of $(0.8) million and $5.4 million, respectively. This income / (loss) relates to the generation components of Stuart and Killen, which were retired in 2018 and sold in 2019, and Conesville, which was retired in May 2020 and sold in June 2020. See Part II, Item 8, Note 14 - Discontinued Operations in the Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENT - DPL\nDPL manages its business through one reportable operating segment, the Utility segment. The primary segment performance measure is income / (loss) from continuing operations before income tax as management has concluded that this measure best reflects the underlying business performance of DPL and is the most relevant measure considered in DPL's internal evaluation of the financial performance of its segments. The Utility segment is discussed further below:\nUtility Segment\nThe Utility segment is comprised primarily of AES Ohio's electric transmission and distribution businesses, which distribute electricity to residential, commercial, industrial and governmental customers. AES Ohio distributes electricity to more than 534,000 retail customers who are located in a 6,000-square mile area of West Central Ohio. AES Ohio's electric transmission and distribution businesses are subject to rate regulation by federal and state regulators. Accordingly, AES Ohio applies the accounting standards for regulated operations to its electric transmission and distribution businesses recording regulatory assets when incurred costs are expected to be recovered in future customer rates and regulatory liabilities when current cost recoveries in customer rates relate to expected future costs. The Utility segment includes revenues and costs associated with our investment in OVEC and the historical results of AES Ohio's Hutchings Coal Station, which was closed in 2013 and transferred to a third party in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nIncluded within the Other\u201d column are other businesses that do not meet the GAAP requirements for disclosure as reportable segments as well as certain corporate costs, which include interest expense and loss on early extinguishment of debt on DPL's long-term debt as well as adjustments related to purchase accounting from the Merger. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 1 - Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Intersegment sales, costs of sales and expenses are eliminated in consolidation. Certain shared and corporate costs are allocated between \"Other\" and the Utility reporting segment.\nSee Note 12 - Business Segments of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding DPL's reportable segment.\nThe following table presents DPL's Income / (loss) from continuing operations before income tax by business segment:\nTable 33:

Income before income tax. This format is useful to investors because it allows analysis and comparability of operating trends and includes the same information that is used by management to make decisions regarding our financial performance.\nThe following review of results of operations compares the results for the year ended December 31, 2021 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2020. For discussion comparing the results for the year ended December 31, 2020 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2019, see Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 24, 2021.\nAES Ohio - Revenues\nRetail customers, especially residential and commercial customers, consume more electricity on warmer and colder days. Therefore, our retail sales demand is affected by the number of heating and cooling degree-days occurring during a year. Cooling degree-days typically have a more significant effect than heating degree-days since some residential customers do not use electricity to heat their homes. Additionally, our retail revenues are affected by regulated rates and riders, including the changes to our ESP, described in Note 2 - Regulatory Matters of Notes to AES Ohio's Financial Statements.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, Revenues increased $11.6 million to $663.7 million from $652.1 million in the same period of the prior year. This increase was a result of:\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$ in millions </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 vs. 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in Energy Efficiency and USF Revenue Rate Riders </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(29.0) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease due to Energy Efficiency shared savings </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.9) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease due to Storm Rider </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.8) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in Competitive Bid Revenue Rate Rider (Standard Offer Rate) </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.8) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase due to the TCRR Rider </td> <td> </td> <td>41.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(2.1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in retail rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(7.7) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volume </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in demand primarily due to favorable weather compared to the same period in the prior year. </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other miscellaneous </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.5) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total retail change\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(3.1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase primarily due to higher rates and volumes at OVEC </td> <td> </td> <td>8.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RTO ancillary and capacity revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase primarily due to higher transmission revenues as a result of changing from a stated rate to a formula rate in May 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>7.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Miscellaneous revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Miscellaneous revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.4) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in Revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAES Ohio - Net Purchased Power\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, Net Purchased Power increased $45.7 million compared to the prior year.

The increase was primarily the result of higher depreciable property, plant and equipment balances in the current year.\nAES Ohio - Taxes Other Than Income Taxes\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, Taxes other than income taxes increased $2.8 million compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily the result of a favorable property tax true-up in the prior year, resulting from a new assessment from the state of Ohio.\nAES Ohio - Loss on Disposal of Business\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, AES Ohio recorded a Loss on disposal of business of $4.7 million due to the loss on the transfer of business interests in the Hutchings Coal Station.\nAES Ohio - Income Tax Expense\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, Income tax expense decreased $1.3 million from $7.0 million in 2020 to $5.7 million in 2021 primarily due to a decrease in income before income tax compared to the prior year.\nKEY TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nDuring 2022 and beyond, we expect that our financial results will be driven primarily by retail demand and weather. As discussed in Note 2 - Regulatory Matters of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 2 - Regulatory Matters of Notes to AES Ohio's Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report, AES Ohio has requested PUCO approval to defer its decoupling costs consistent with the methodology approved in its distribution rate order. If approved, the deferral would be effective as of December 18, 2019 and going forward would reduce impacts of weather, energy efficiency programs and economic changes in customer demand. In addition, DPL's and AES Ohio's financial results are likely to be driven by other factors including, but not limited to:\n\u2022regulatory outcomes;\n\u2022the passage of new legislation, implementation of regulations or other changes in regulations; and\n\u2022timely recovery of transmission and distribution expenditures.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted global economic activity, including electricity and energy consumption, and caused significant volatility in financial markets. Responses to the COVID-19 pandemic by the State of Ohio and its residents and businesses continue to evolve as virus variants emerge, vaccine availability and usage continues and the state and businesses review and adjust the scope and requirements of social distancing measures.\nSocial distancing measures designed to slow the spread of the virus, such as business closures and operations limitations, impact energy demand within our service industry. In addition to the impacts to demand within our service territory, we also have incurred and expect to continue to incur expenses relating to COVID-19, and such expenses may include those that relate to events outside of our control. We experienced impacts from the pandemic in 2021 and into 2022 and expect to continue to experience impacts for the remainder of 2022. The following discussion highlights our assessment of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our current financial and operating status, and our financial and operational outlook based on information known as of this filing. Any impacts in future periods could have material and adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Also see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" of this Form 10-K.\nBusiness Continuity - During the COVID-19 pandemic, we are taking a variety of measures to ensure our ability to transmit, distribute and sell electric energy, to ensure the health and safety of our employees, contractors, customers and communities and to provide essential services to the communities in which we operate. We continue to respond to this global crisis through comprehensive measures to protect our employees and others while fulfilling our vital role in providing our customers with electric energy. While stay-at-home restrictions have been lifted in our service territory, most of our management and administrative personnel are able to work remotely, and we have not experienced significant issues affecting our operations or ability to maintain effective internal controls and produce reliable financial information. We prioritize the safety of our people and continue to develop targeted strategies, in line with legal and regulatory requirements, to promote vaccination in our business.\nDemand - As the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic started to materialize in Ohio in March 2020 and continued for the duration of 2020 and into 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic primarily impacted our retail sales demand. Retail sales demand decreased in 2020 mostly from commercial and industrial customers, but started to recover in 2021 as shown by the changes in weather-normalized volumes of kWh sold by customer class as follows:\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the three </td> <td> </td> <td>For the three </td> <td> </td> <td>For the three </td> <td> </td> <td>For the three </td> <td> </td> <td>For the </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>months ended </td> <td> </td> <td>months ended </td> <td> </td> <td>months ended </td> <td> </td> <td>months ended </td> <td> </td> <td>year ended </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>March 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>June 30, </td> <td> </td> <td>September 30, </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer Class </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 vs. 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 vs. 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 vs. 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 vs. 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 vs. 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.2)% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3% </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.2)% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.6)% </td> <td> </td> <td>11.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.9) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.9) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.8)% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.8)% </td> <td> </td> <td>14.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.9)% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.0)% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.1) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.2) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.1)% </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.5)% </td> <td> </td> <td>19.8% </td> <td> </td> <td>(19.9)% </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.0)% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Government and Other </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.9)% </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.3)% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.4% </td> <td> </td> <td>(14.0)% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.4% </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.7)% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.6) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.3) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.3)% </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.3)% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.7% </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.1)% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.9)% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.3% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.8) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs noted above, we also have incurred and expect to continue to incur expenses relating to COVID-19, however see Note 2 - Regulatory Matters of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of regulatory measures which partially mitigate the impact of these expenses. While we have continued to experience COVID-19 impacts into 2022, we continue to expect that such impacts would not be material, particularly if less expansive social distancing measures and improvements in energy demand continue. The magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown at this time, however, and could have material and adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future periods.\nLiquidity - We anticipate having sufficient liquidity to make all required payments, including payments for salaries and wages owed to our employees, during the pandemic. We do not foresee a significant impact to our access to capital or our liquidity position as a result of the pandemic. For further discussion of our financial condition, liquidity, and capital requirements, see Part II, Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity of this Form 10-K.\nCredit Exposures - We continue to monitor and manage our credit exposures in a prudent manner. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we experienced credit-related impacts from utility customers due to the prohibition of electric utilities, including us, from discontinuing electric utility service to customers through September 1, 2020 and due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. AES Ohio implemented and continues to offer extended payment plans to customers during the pandemic. In 2021, collections improved and credit-related impacts were not significant. If credit-related impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic occur in 2022 or beyond, deterioration in our credit exposures and customer collections could result. However, as discussed in Note 2 - Regulatory Matters of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 2 - Regulatory Matters of Notes to AES Ohio's Financial Statements in Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of our Form 10-K, AES Ohio's uncollectible expense is deferred for future collection.\nSupply Chain - We continue to closely manage and monitor developments in our supply chain. We are experiencing certain minor delays and price increases, but these have not materially impacted our operations or capital projects to date.\nCapital Projects - During the COVID-19 pandemic, our construction projects have experienced some indications of delays and price increases; however, they are currently proceeding without material delays. For further discussion of our capital requirements, see Part II, Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity of this Form 10-K.\nCARES Act - The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (\"CARES\") Act was passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law on March 27, 2020. While we currently expect a limited impact from this legislation on our business, we deferred the payment of federal payroll taxes in accordance with the provisions of this act. The total deferred was approximately $2.1 million, and at December 31, 2021, the total remaining unpaid balance was approximately $1.1 million, which will be paid in 2022.\nSee Note 16 - Risks & Uncertainties of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 14 - Risks & Uncertainties of Notes to AES Ohio's Financial Statements for more information and Part II, Item 1a - Risk Factors of this Form 10-K for more information.\nOperational\nOur previously announced plan to retire or sell our generation facilities was completed with the sale of our interest in Unit 4 of Conesville in June 2020. For additional information on these events and DPL's previously-owned coal-fired facilities, see Note 14 - Discontinued Operations of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nMacroeconomic and Political\nReference Rate Reform - In July 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. In the U.S., the Alternative Reference Rate Committee at the Federal Reserve identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR; alternative reference rates in other key markets are under development. On November 30, 2020, the ICE Benchmark Association (\"IBA\") announced it had begun consultation on its intention to cease publication of two specific LIBOR rates by December 31, 2021, while extending the timeline for the overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month, and 12-month USD LIBOR rates through June 30, 2023. The IBA expects to make separate announcements in this regard following the outcome of the consultation. We maintain financial instruments that use LIBOR as an interest rate benchmark and will continue to engage with counterparties to make this transition.\nInflation - In the markets in which we operate, there have been higher rates of inflation in recent months. If inflation continues to increase in our markets, it may increase our expenses that we may not be able to pass through to customers. AES Ohio may have the ability to recover operations and maintenance costs through the regulatory process, however, timing impacts on recovery may vary.\nRegulatory Environment\nFor a comprehensive discussion of the market structure and regulation of DPL and AES Ohio, see Part I, Item 1 - Business - Competition and Regulation.\nDistribution Rate Case - On November 30, 2020, AES Ohio filed a new distribution rate case with the PUCO. This rate case proposes a revenue increase of $120.8 million. A hearing on this case was held beginning in January 2022 and the case is pending a commission order.\nStipulation and Recommendation - On October 23, 2020, AES Ohio entered into a Stipulation and Recommendation (the Settlement) with the staff of the PUCO and various customers, and organizations representing customers of AES Ohio and certain other parties with respect to, among other matters, AES Ohio's applications pending at the PUCO for (i) approval of AES Ohio's plan to modernize its distribution grid (the Smart Grid Plan), (ii) findings that AES Ohio passed the SEET for 2018 and 2019, and (iii) findings that AES Ohio's current ESP 1 satisfies the SEET and the more favorable in the aggregate (MFA) regulatory test. A hearing was held in January 2021 for consideration of this settlement and on June 16, 2021, the PUCO issued their opinion and order accepting the stipulation as filed.\nOhio House Bill 6 - Legislation was passed, Ohio House Bill 128, that repeals Ohio House Bill 6 provisions related to a nuclear fund and decoupling, effective June 30, 2021. Other provisions from Ohio House Bill 6 currently remain in place, which include the following: beginning January 1, 2020, permitted Ohio utilities, such as AES Ohio, may defer, recover or credit the net proceeds from selling energy and capacity received as part of their interest in OVEC and their OVEC-related costs through a statewide non-bypassable recovery mechanism through 2030; eliminates the annual energy efficiency targets for Ohio utilities after 2020; and allows Ohio utilities to construct customer-sited renewable generation for mercantile customers or groups of mercantile customers, the costs of which may only be recovered from those customers. If these provisions from Ohio House Bill 6 are repealed without a replacement with comparable provisions, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nFor more information on the above matters, see Note 2 - Regulatory Matters of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 2 - Regulatory Matters of Notes to AES Ohio's Financial Statements.\nCAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY\nAs of December 31, 2021, cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash for DPL and AES Ohio was $26.7 million and $14.5 million, respectively, and available borrowing capacity at DPL and AES Ohio was $35.0 million and $175.0 million, respectively. DPL and AES Ohio had aggregate principal amounts of long-term debt outstanding of $1,412.8 million and $582.2 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021.\nWe depend on timely and continued access to capital markets to manage our liquidity needs. The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, to refinance existing indebtedness or to fund operations and other commitments during times of political or economic uncertainty or otherwise could have material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, changes in the timing of tariff increases or delays in the regulatory\ndeterminations as well as unfavorable regulatory outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. See \"RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION AND LAWS\" and \"RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION\" in Part I, Item 1a - Risk Factors and \"COMPETITION AND REGULATION\" in Part I, Item 1 - Business. From time to time, we may elect to repurchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise when management believes such repurchases are favorable to make. The amounts involved in any such repurchases may be material.\nAES Ohio must first seek approval from the PUCO to issue new stocks, bonds, notes and other evidences of indebtedness. Annually, AES Ohio must receive authority to issue and assume liability on short-term debt, not to exceed 12 months. AES Ohio received an order from the PUCO on December 15, 2021 granting authority through December 31, 2022 to, among other things, issue up to $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of short-term indebtedness. AES Ohio must also receive authority to issue and assume liability on long-term debt, in excess of 12 months. AES Ohio last received approval in 2020 to, among other things, issue up to $140.0 million in First Mortgage Bonds. AES Ohio also has restrictions on the amount of new debt that may be issued due to contractual obligations of AES and by financial covenant restrictions under existing debt obligations. AES Ohio does not believe such restrictions will be a limiting factor in our ability to issue debt in the ordinary course of prudent business operations.\nCASH FLOWS\nDPL's financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements include the consolidated results of its principal subsidiary AES Ohio. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nCash Flow Analysis - DPL:\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DPL </td> <td> </td> <td>Years ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$ in millions </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>116.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>113.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>180.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(213.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(185.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(222.6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by / (used in) financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>97.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22.4) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase / (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash </td> <td> </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(64.7) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at beginning of year </td> <td> </td> <td>25.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>111.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of year </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal year 2021 versus 2020:\nDPL -

This $27.3 million increase in cash used was primarily due to a $34.0 million increase in capital expenditures due to increased spending on T&D projects in the current year and $5.1 million of proceeds received from the sale of software in the prior year. These increases in cash used were partially offset by a $8.3 million decrease in cost of removal payments and a $3.4 million decrease in net payments on the disposal of business interests primarily due to higher payments on the transfer of the retired Hutchings Coal Station in the prior year.\nDPL - Net cash from financing activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities was $97.3 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $50.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This $47.0 million increase was primarily due to a $34.5 million increase in equity contributions from AES in the current year, a $9.0 million increase in net borrowings on revolving credit facilities in the current year, and a $7.6 million decrease in payments of deferred financing costs in the current year. These increases were partially offset by $4.2 million of net issuances of long-term debt in the prior year.\nCash Flow Analysis - AES Ohio:\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AES Ohio\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Years ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$ in millions </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>130.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>91.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>199.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(205.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(186.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(170.6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by / (used in) financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>78.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(74.2) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase / (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(44.9) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at beginning of year </td> <td> </td> <td>11.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of year </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal year 2021 versus 2020:\nAES Ohio -

Our business is capital intensive, requiring significant resources to fund operating expenses, construction expenditures, scheduled debt maturities and carrying costs, taxes and any dividend payments. For 2022 and subsequent years, we expect to satisfy these requirements with a combination of cash from operations, funds from debt financing and funds from equity capital contributions as our internal liquidity needs and market conditions warrant. We also expect that the borrowing capacity under the DPL Credit Agreement and the AES Ohio Credit Agreement will continue to be available to manage working capital requirements during those periods. The absence of adequate liquidity could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAt December 31, 2021, DPL and AES Ohio have access to the following revolving credit agreements:\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$ in millions </td> <td> </td> <td>Type </td> <td> </td> <td>Maturity </td> <td> </td> <td>Commitment </td> <td> </td> <td>Amounts available as of December 31, 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DPL Credit Agreement </td> <td> </td> <td>Revolving </td> <td> </td> <td>June 2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AES Ohio Credit Agreement\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Revolving </td> <td> </td> <td>June 2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>175.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>175.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>275.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>210.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDPL entered into an amendment and restatement of the DPL Credit Agreement on June 19, 2019 with a syndication of bank lenders.

In addition, the applicable interest rates on DPL's Credit Agreement and AES Ohio's Credit Agreement (as well as the amount of certain other fees in the agreements) are dependent upon the credit ratings of DPL and AES Ohio. Downgrades in the credit ratings of AES could result in DPL's or AES Ohio's credit ratings being downgraded. Any reduction in our debt or credit ratings may adversely affect the trading price of our outstanding debt securities. Non-investment grade companies may experience higher costs to issue new securities.\nThe following table presents the debt ratings and credit ratings (issuer/corporate rating) and outlook for DPL and AES Ohio.\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt Ratings </td> <td> </td> <td>DPL </td> <td> </td> <td>AES Ohio\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Outlook </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fitch Ratings </td> <td> </td> <td>BB(a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>BBB+ (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Negative </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Moody's Investors Service, Inc. </td> <td> </td> <td>Ba1 (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>A3 (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Stable </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC </td> <td> </td> <td>BB+ (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>BBB+ (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Stable </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit ratings </td> <td> </td> <td>DPL </td> <td> </td> <td>AES Ohio </td> <td> </td> <td>Outlook </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fitch Ratings </td> <td> </td> <td>BB </td> <td> </td> <td>BBB- </td> <td> </td> <td>Negative </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Moody's Investors Service, Inc. </td> <td> </td> <td>Ba1 </td> <td> </td> <td>Baa2 </td> <td> </td> <td>Stable </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC </td> <td> </td> <td>BB+ </td> <td> </td> <td>BB+ </td> <td> </td> <td>Stable </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)Rating relates to DPL's senior unsecured debt.\n(b)Rating relates to AES Ohio's senior secured debt.\nWe cannot predict whether the current debt and credit ratings of DPL or the debt and credit ratings of AES Ohio will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Such ratings\nmay be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAES Ohio owns a 4.9% equity ownership interest in OVEC which is recorded using the cost method of accounting under GAAP. At December 31, 2021, AES Ohio could be responsible for the repayment of 4.9%, or $55.5 million, of a $1,131.7 million debt obligation comprised of both fixed and variable rate securities with maturities between 2022 and 2040. This would only happen if OVEC defaulted on its debt payments. At December 31, 2021, we have no knowledge of such a default.\nCommercial Commitments and Contractual Obligations\nWe enter into various contractual obligations and other commercial commitments that may affect the liquidity of our operations. At December 31, 2021, these include:\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments due in: </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$ in millions </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 year </td> <td> </td> <td>2 - 3\nyears </td> <td> </td> <td>4 - 5\nyears </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DPL: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,412.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>415.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>996.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments </td> <td> </td> <td>761.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>115.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>498.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electricity purchase commitments </td> <td> </td> <td>82.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase orders and other contractual obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>149.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>138.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,406.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>279.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>126.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>505.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,495.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments due in: </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$ in millions </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 year </td> <td> </td> <td>2 - 3\nyears </td> <td> </td> <td>4 - 5\nyears </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AES Ohio:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>582.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>581.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments </td> <td> </td> <td>561.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>451.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electricity purchase commitments </td> <td> </td> <td>82.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase orders and other contractual obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>146.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>136.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,373.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>241.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,033.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLong-term debt:\nDPL's Long-term debt at December 31, 2021 consists of DPL's unsecured notes and Capital Trust II securities, along with AES Ohio's First Mortgage Bonds and the WPAFB note. These long-term debt amounts include current maturities but exclude unamortized debt discounts, premiums and fair value adjustments.\nAES Ohio's Long-term debt at December 31, 2021 consists of its First Mortgage Bonds and the WPAFB note. These long-term debt amounts include current maturities but exclude unamortized debt discounts.\nSee Note 6 - Long-term debt of the Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 6 - Long-term debt of the Notes to AES Ohio's Financial Statements.\nInterest payments:\nInterest payments are associated with the long-term debt described above. The interest payments relating to variable-rate debt are projected using the interest rates in effect at December 31, 2021.\nElectricity purchase commitments:\nDPL enters into long-term contracts for the purchase of electricity. In general, these contracts are subject to variable quantities or prices and are terminable only in limited circumstances.\nPurchase orders and other contractual obligations:\nAt December 31, 2021, DPL and AES Ohio had various other contractual obligations including contracts to purchase goods and services with various terms and expiration dates. Due to uncertainty regarding the timing and payment of future obligations to the Service Company, and DPL's and AES Ohio's ability to terminate such obligations upon 90 days' notice, we have excluded such amounts in the contractual obligations table above. This table also does not include:\n\u2022regulatory liabilities (see Note 2 - Regulatory Matters of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 2 - Regulatory Matters of Notes to AES Ohio's Financial Statements);\n\u2022taxes (see Note 7 - Income Taxes of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 7 - Income Taxes of Notes to AES Ohio's Financial Statements);\n\u2022pension and other postretirement employee benefit liabilities (see Note 8 - Benefit Plans of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 8 - Benefit Plans of Notes to AES Ohio's Financial Statements);\n\u2022contingencies (see Note 10 - Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 10 - Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to AES Ohio's Financial Statements); and\n\u2022amounts due to related parties (see Note 11 - Related Party Transactions of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 11 - Related Party Transactions of Notes to AES Ohio's Financial Statements).\nReserve for uncertain tax positions:\nDue to the uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits of $0.4 million at December 31, 2021, we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the periods of cash settlement with the respective tax authorities and have not included such amounts in the contractual obligations table above.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nDPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and AES Ohio's Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In connection with the preparation of these financial statements, our management is required to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities. These assumptions, estimates and judgments are based on our historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable at the time. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Our critical accounting estimates are those which require assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 - Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 1 - Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to AES Ohio's Financial Statements.\nDifferent estimates could have a material effect on our financial results. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and estimates may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or circumstances. Historically, however, recorded estimates have not differed materially from actual results. Significant items subject to such judgments include: the carrying value of property, plant and equipment; unbilled revenues; the valuation of allowances for deferred income taxes; regulatory assets and liabilities; reserves recorded for income tax exposures; litigation; contingencies; the valuation of AROs; and assets and liabilities related to employee benefits.\nRevenue Recognition (including Unbilled Revenue)\nAt the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is accrued. In making our estimates of unbilled revenue, we use complex models that consider various factors including known amounts of energy usage by nearly all residential, small commercial and industrial customers; estimated line losses; and estimated customer rates based on prior period billings. Given the use of these models, and that customers are billed on a monthly cycle, we believe it is unlikely that materially different results will occur in future periods when revenue is billed. The effect on 2021 revenues and ending unbilled revenues of a one percentage point change in estimated line losses for the month of December 2021 is immaterial. An allowance for potential credit losses is maintained and amounts are written off when normal collection efforts have been exhausted.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to federal and state income taxes. Our income tax provision requires significant judgment and is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcome of tax examinations when determining the adequacy of our income tax provisions by considering the technical merits of the filing position, case law and results of previous tax examinations. Accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and measurement requirements for financial statement reporting of our income tax positions. Tax reserves have been established which we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional\nassessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted only when there is more information available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves. While we believe that the amount of the tax reserves is reasonable, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may be materially different than the reserve amounts.\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nApplication of the provisions of GAAP relating to regulatory accounting requires us to reflect the effect of rate regulation in DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and AES Ohio's Financial Statements. For regulated businesses subject to federal or state cost-of-service rate regulation, regulatory practices that assign costs to accounting periods may differ from accounting methods generally applied by non-regulated companies. When it is probable that regulators will permit the recovery of current costs through future rates charged to customers, we defer these costs as Regulatory assets that otherwise would be expensed by non-regulated companies. Likewise, we recognize Regulatory liabilities when it is probable that regulators will require customer refunds through future rates and when revenue is collected from customers for expenses that are not yet incurred. Regulatory assets are amortized into expense and Regulatory liabilities are amortized into income over the recovery period authorized by the regulator.\nWe evaluate our Regulatory assets to determine whether or not they are probable of recovery through future rates and make various assumptions in our analyses. The expectations of future recovery are generally based on orders issued by regulatory commissions or historical experience, as well as discussions with applicable regulatory authorities. If recovery of a regulatory asset is determined to be less than probable, it will be expensed in the period the assessment is made. We currently believe the recovery of our Regulatory assets is probable. See Note 2 - Regulatory Matters of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 2 - Regulatory Matters of Notes to AES Ohio's Financial Statements.\nPension and Postretirement Benefits\nSee Note 1 - Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 1 - Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to AES Ohio's Financial Statements for information on our accounting policies regarding Pension and Postretirement Benefits.\nContingent and Other Obligations\nDuring the conduct of our business, we are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, as well as other factors and conditions that potentially subject us to environmental, litigation, insurance and other risks. We periodically evaluate our exposure to such risks and record estimated liabilities for those matters where a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with GAAP. In recording such estimated liabilities, we may make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses as they relate to contingent and other obligations. These assumptions and estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions and may be subject to change. We believe such estimates and assumptions are reasonable.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nA discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements is in Note 1 - Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 1 - Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to AES Ohio's Financial Statements and such discussion is incorporated by reference in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and made a part hereof.\nLEGAL AND OTHER MATTERS\nDiscussions of legal and other matters are provided in Item 1 - Business \"Environmental Matters\", Item 1 - Business \"Competition and Regulation\" and Item 3 - Legal Proceedings.

audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes thereto and AES Ohio's audited Financial Statements and the related Notes thereto included in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from the results suggested by these forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this Form 10-K and Item 1A - Risk Factors. For a list of certain abbreviations or acronyms in this discussion, see Glossary of Terms at the beginning of this Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW OF 2021 RESULTS AND STRATEGIC PERFORMANCE\nThe most important matters on which we focus in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance and allocating our resources include: (i) recurring factors which have significant impacts on operating performance such as: regulatory action, environmental matters, weather and weather-related damage in our service area, customer growth, and the local economy; (ii) our progress on performance improvement and growth strategies designed to maintain high standards in several operating areas (including safety, customer satisfaction, operations, financial and enterprise-wide performance, talent management/people, capital allocation/sustainability and corporate social responsibility) simultaneously; and (iii) our short-term and long-term financial and operating strategies. For a discussion of how we are impacted by regulation and environmental matters, please see Note 2 - Regulatory Matters of the Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2 - Regulatory Matters of the Notes to AES Ohio's Financial Statements and Environmental Matters\u201d in Item 1 - Business.\u201d\nOperational Excellence\nOur objective is to optimize AES Ohio's performance in the U.S. utility industry by focusing on the following areas: safety, operations (reliability and customer satisfaction), financial and enterprise-wide performance (efficiency and cost savings, talent management/people, capital allocation/sustainability and corporate social responsibility). We set and measure these objectives carefully, balancing them in a way and to a degree necessary to ensure a sustainable high level of performance in these areas simultaneously compared to our peers. We monitor our performance in these areas, and where practical and meaningful, compare performance in some areas to peer utilities. Because some of our financial and enterprise-wide performance measures are company-specific performance goals, they are not benchmarked.\nOur safety performance is measured by both leading and lagging metrics. Our leading safety metrics track safety observations, safety meeting engagement and the reporting of non-injury significant injury potential incidents. Our lagging safety metrics track lost workday cases, severity rate, and recordable incidents. We are committed to excellence in safety and have implemented various programs to increase safety awareness and improve work practices.\nAES Ohio measures delivery reliability by Customer Average Interruption Duration Index (\"CAIDI\"), System Average Interruption Duration Index (\"SAIDI\") and System Average Interruption Frequency Index (\"SAIFI\") and benchmarks the reliability metrics against other utilities at both the state and national levels. AES Ohio also measures customer centricity on more of an individual basis by the industry metric of Customers that Experience Multiple Interruption of five or more times ( CEMI-5\u201d). We measure customer satisfaction using Research America Utilities Market Research - Consumer Insight. Monitoring performance in the areas such as competitive rates, operational reliability and customer service supports our ongoing work to deliver reliable service to our customers.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe following review of results of operations compares the results for the year ended December 31, 2021 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2020. For a discussion comparing the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2019, see Item 7. - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 24, 2021.\nDPL\nCompared with the prior year, DPL's results for the year ended December 31, 2021 reflect an increase in income / (loss) from continuing operations before income tax of $34.3 million, or 288%, primarily due to factors including, but not limited to:\n\nAES Ohio\nCompared with the prior year, AES Ohio's results for the year ended December 31, 2021 reflect a decrease in income from continuing operations before income tax of $5.3 million, or 9%, primarily due to factors including, but not limited to:\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - DPL\nDPL's results of operations include the results of its subsidiaries, including the consolidated results of its principal subsidiary AES Ohio. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. A separate specific discussion of the results of operations for AES Ohio is presented elsewhere in this report.\nStatement of Operations Highlights - DPL\n\n(a)For purposes of discussing operating results, we present and discuss Income / (loss) from continuing operations before income tax. This format is useful to investors because it allows analysis and comparability of operating trends and includes the same information that is used by management to make decisions regarding our financial performance.\nThe following review of consolidated results of operations compares the results for the year ended December 31, 2021 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2020. For discussion comparing the results for the year ended December 31, 2020 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2019, see Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 24, 2021.\nDPL - Revenues\nRetail customers, especially residential and commercial customers, consume more electricity on warmer and colder days. Therefore, our retail sales demand is affected by the number of heating and cooling degree-days occurring during a year. Cooling degree-days typically have a more significant effect than heating degree-days since some residential customers do not use electricity to heat their homes. Additionally, our retail revenues are affected by regulated rates and riders, including the changes to our ESP, described in Note 2 - Regulatory Matters of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nHeating and Cooling Degree-days (a)\n\n(a)Heating and cooling degree-days are a measure of the relative heating or cooling required for a home or business. The heating degrees in a day are calculated as the degrees that the average actual daily temperature is below 65 degrees Fahrenheit. For example, if the average temperature on March 20th was 40 degrees Fahrenheit, the heating degrees for that day would be the 25-degree difference between 65 degrees and 40 degrees. Similarly, cooling degrees in a day are calculated as the degrees that the average actual daily temperature is above 65 degrees Fahrenheit.\n(b)30-year average is computed from observed degree-days in the Dayton area on a trailing 30-year basis.\nDPL's and AES Ohio's electric sales and billed customers were as follows:\n\n(a)Electric sales are presented in millions of kWh.\n(b)DPL and AES Ohio retail electric sales represent the total transmission and distribution retail sales for the periods presented. SSO sales were 3,721 million kWh and 3,850 million kWh for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n(c)Wholesale electric sales are AES Ohio's 4.9% share of the generation output of OVEC.\nThe following graph shows the percentage changes in weather-normalized and actual retail electric sales volumes by customer class for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, Revenues increased $12.2 million to $672.7 million from $660.5 million in the same period of the prior year. This increase was a result of:\n\nDPL - Net Purchased Power\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, Net Purchased Power increased $45.7 million compared to the prior year. This increase was a result of:\n\nDPL - Operation and Maintenance\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, Operation and Maintenance expense decreased $29.3 million compared to the prior year. This decrease was a result of:\n\n(a) There is corresponding revenue associated with these program costs resulting in minimal impact to Net income.\nDPL - Depreciation and Amortization\nDuring the year ended December 30, 2021, Depreciation and amortization increased $2.8 million compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily the result of higher depreciable property, plant and equipment balances in the current year.\nDPL - Taxes Other Than Income Taxes\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, Taxes other than income taxes increased $2.7 million compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily the result of a favorable property tax true-up in the prior year, resulting from a new assessment from the state of Ohio.\nDPL - Loss on Disposal of Business\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, DPL recorded a Loss on disposal of business of $4.7 million due to the loss on the transfer of business interests in the Hutchings Coal Station.\nDPL - Interest Expense\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, Interest expense decreased $8.4 million compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily the result of the refinancing of debt at DPL in 2020.\nDPL - Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, DPL recorded a Loss on early extinguishment of debt of $31.7 million primarily due to the make-whole premium payment of $30.8 million related to the redemption of the $380.0 million 7.25% Notes due 2021 in the third quarter of 2020.\nDPL - Income Tax Expense From Continuing Operations\nIncome tax benefit decreased $5.0 million from $5.5 million in 2020 to $0.5 million in 2021. The decrease of $5.0 million was primarily due to income from continuing operations before income tax, less the reversal of excess deferred items, in the current year as compared to a loss from continuing operations before income tax, less the reversal of excess deferred items, in the prior year.\nDPL - Discontinued Operations\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, DPL recorded income / (loss) from discontinued operations (net of tax) of $(0.8) million and $5.4 million, respectively. This income / (loss) relates to the generation components of Stuart and Killen, which were retired in 2018 and sold in 2019, and Conesville, which was retired in May 2020 and sold in June 2020. See Part II, Item 8, Note 14 - Discontinued Operations in the Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENT - DPL\nDPL manages its business through one reportable operating segment, the Utility segment. The primary segment performance measure is income / (loss) from continuing operations before income tax as management has concluded that this measure best reflects the underlying business performance of DPL and is the most relevant measure considered in DPL's internal evaluation of the financial performance of its segments. The Utility segment is discussed further below:\nUtility Segment\nThe Utility segment is comprised primarily of AES Ohio's electric transmission and distribution businesses, which distribute electricity to residential, commercial, industrial and governmental customers. AES Ohio distributes electricity to more than 534,000 retail customers who are located in a 6,000-square mile area of West Central Ohio. AES Ohio's electric transmission and distribution businesses are subject to rate regulation by federal and state regulators. Accordingly, AES Ohio applies the accounting standards for regulated operations to its electric transmission and distribution businesses recording regulatory assets when incurred costs are expected to be recovered in future customer rates and regulatory liabilities when current cost recoveries in customer rates relate to expected future costs. The Utility segment includes revenues and costs associated with our investment in OVEC and the historical results of AES Ohio's Hutchings Coal Station, which was closed in 2013 and transferred to a third party in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nIncluded within the Other\u201d column are other businesses that do not meet the GAAP requirements for disclosure as reportable segments as well as certain corporate costs, which include interest expense and loss on early extinguishment of debt on DPL's long-term debt as well as adjustments related to purchase accounting from the Merger. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 1 - Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Intersegment sales, costs of sales and expenses are eliminated in consolidation. Certain shared and corporate costs are allocated between \"Other\" and the Utility reporting segment.\nSee Note 12 - Business Segments of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding DPL's reportable segment.\nThe following table presents DPL's Income / (loss) from continuing operations before income tax by business segment:\n\nStatement of Operations Highlights - DPL - Utility Segment\nThe results of operations of the Utility segment for DPL are identical in all material respects and for all periods presented to those of AES Ohio, which are included in Part II - (Statement of Operations Highlights - AES Ohio) of this Form 10-K.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - AES Ohio\nStatement of Operations Highlights - AES Ohio\n\n(a)For purposes of discussing operating results, we present and discuss Income before income tax. This format is useful to investors because it allows analysis and comparability of operating trends and includes the same information that is used by management to make decisions regarding our financial performance.\nThe following review of results of operations compares the results for the year ended December 31, 2021 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2020. For discussion comparing the results for the year ended December 31, 2020 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2019, see Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 24, 2021.\nAES Ohio - Revenues\nRetail customers, especially residential and commercial customers, consume more electricity on warmer and colder days. Therefore, our retail sales demand is affected by the number of heating and cooling degree-days occurring during a year. Cooling degree-days typically have a more significant effect than heating degree-days since some residential customers do not use electricity to heat their homes. Additionally, our retail revenues are affected by regulated rates and riders, including the changes to our ESP, described in Note 2 - Regulatory Matters of Notes to AES Ohio's Financial Statements.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, Revenues increased $11.6 million to $663.7 million from $652.1 million in the same period of the prior year. This increase was a result of:\n\nAES Ohio - Net Purchased Power\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, Net Purchased Power increased $45.7 million compared to the prior year. This increase was a result of:\n\nAES Ohio - Operation and Maintenance\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, Operation and Maintenance expense decreased $29.9 million compared to the prior year. This decrease was a result of:\n\n(a)There is corresponding revenue associated with these program costs resulting in minimal impact to Net income.\nAES Ohio - Depreciation and Amortization\nDuring the year ended December 30, 2021, Depreciation and amortization increased $2.8 million compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily the result of higher depreciable property, plant and equipment balances in the current year.\nAES Ohio - Taxes Other Than Income Taxes\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, Taxes other than income taxes increased $2.8 million compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily the result of a favorable property tax true-up in the prior year, resulting from a new assessment from the state of Ohio.\nAES Ohio - Loss on Disposal of Business\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, AES Ohio recorded a Loss on disposal of business of $4.7 million due to the loss on the transfer of business interests in the Hutchings Coal Station.\nAES Ohio - Income Tax Expense\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, Income tax expense decreased $1.3 million from $7.0 million in 2020 to $5.7 million in 2021 primarily due to a decrease in income before income tax compared to the prior year.\nKEY TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nDuring 2022 and beyond, we expect that our financial results will be driven primarily by retail demand and weather. As discussed in Note 2 - Regulatory Matters of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 2 - Regulatory Matters of Notes to AES Ohio's Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report, AES Ohio has requested PUCO approval to defer its decoupling costs consistent with the methodology approved in its distribution rate order. If approved, the deferral would be effective as of December 18, 2019 and going forward would reduce impacts of weather, energy efficiency programs and economic changes in customer demand. In addition, DPL's and AES Ohio's financial results are likely to be driven by other factors including, but not limited to:\n\u2022regulatory outcomes;\n\u2022the passage of new legislation, implementation of regulations or other changes in regulations; and\n\u2022timely recovery of transmission and distribution expenditures.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted global economic activity, including electricity and energy consumption, and caused significant volatility in financial markets. Responses to the COVID-19 pandemic by the State of Ohio and its residents and businesses continue to evolve as virus variants emerge, vaccine availability and usage continues and the state and businesses review and adjust the scope and requirements of social distancing measures.\nSocial distancing measures designed to slow the spread of the virus, such as business closures and operations limitations, impact energy demand within our service industry. In addition to the impacts to demand within our service territory, we also have incurred and expect to continue to incur expenses relating to COVID-19, and such expenses may include those that relate to events outside of our control. We experienced impacts from the pandemic in 2021 and into 2022 and expect to continue to experience impacts for the remainder of 2022. The following discussion highlights our assessment of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our current financial and operating status, and our financial and operational outlook based on information known as of this filing. Any impacts in future periods could have material and adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Also see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" of this Form 10-K.\nBusiness Continuity - During the COVID-19 pandemic, we are taking a variety of measures to ensure our ability to transmit, distribute and sell electric energy, to ensure the health and safety of our employees, contractors, customers and communities and to provide essential services to the communities in which we operate. We continue to respond to this global crisis through comprehensive measures to protect our employees and others while fulfilling our vital role in providing our customers with electric energy. While stay-at-home restrictions have been lifted in our service territory, most of our management and administrative personnel are able to work remotely, and we have not experienced significant issues affecting our operations or ability to maintain effective internal controls and produce reliable financial information. We prioritize the safety of our people and continue to develop targeted strategies, in line with legal and regulatory requirements, to promote vaccination in our business.\nDemand - As the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic started to materialize in Ohio in March 2020 and continued for the duration of 2020 and into 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic primarily impacted our retail sales demand. Retail sales demand decreased in 2020 mostly from commercial and industrial customers, but started to recover in 2021 as shown by the changes in weather-normalized volumes of kWh sold by customer class as follows:\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with DPL's audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes thereto and AES Ohio's audited Financial Statements and the related Notes thereto included in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from the results suggested by these forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this Form 10-K and Item 1A - Risk Factors. For a list of certain abbreviations or acronyms in this discussion, see Glossary of Terms at the beginning of this Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW OF 2021 RESULTS AND STRATEGIC PERFORMANCE\nThe most important matters on which we focus in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance and allocating our resources include: (i) recurring factors which have significant impacts on operating performance such as: regulatory action, environmental matters, weather and weather-related damage in our service area, customer growth, and the local economy; (ii) our progress on performance improvement and growth strategies designed to maintain high standards in several operating areas (including safety, customer satisfaction, operations, financial and enterprise-wide performance, talent management/people, capital allocation/sustainability and corporate social responsibility) simultaneously; and (iii) our short-term and long-term financial and operating strategies. For a discussion of how we are impacted by regulation and environmental matters, please see Note 2 - Regulatory Matters of the Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2 - Regulatory Matters of the Notes to AES Ohio's Financial Statements and Environmental Matters\u201d in Item 1 - Business.\u201d\nOperational Excellence\nOur objective is to optimize AES Ohio's performance in the U.S. utility industry by focusing on the following areas: safety, operations (reliability and customer satisfaction), financial and enterprise-wide performance (efficiency and cost savings, talent management/people, capital allocation/sustainability and corporate social responsibility). We set and measure these objectives carefully, balancing them in a way and to a degree necessary to ensure a sustainable high level of performance in these areas simultaneously compared to our peers. We monitor our performance in these areas, and where practical and meaningful, compare performance in some areas to peer utilities. Because some of our financial and enterprise-wide performance measures are company-specific performance goals, they are not benchmarked.\nOur safety performance is measured by both leading and lagging metrics. Our leading safety metrics track safety observations, safety meeting engagement and the reporting of non-injury significant injury potential incidents. Our lagging safety metrics track lost workday cases, severity rate, and recordable incidents. We are committed to excellence in safety and have implemented various programs to increase safety awareness and improve work practices.\nAES Ohio measures delivery reliability by Customer Average Interruption Duration Index (\"CAIDI\"), System Average Interruption Duration Index (\"SAIDI\") and System Average Interruption Frequency Index (\"SAIFI\") and benchmarks the reliability metrics against other utilities at both the state and national levels. AES Ohio also measures customer centricity on more of an individual basis by the industry metric of Customers that Experience Multiple Interruption of five or more times ( CEMI-5\u201d). We measure customer satisfaction using Research America Utilities Market Research - Consumer Insight. Monitoring performance in the areas such as competitive rates, operational reliability and customer service supports our ongoing work to deliver reliable service to our customers.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe following review of results of operations compares the results for the year ended December 31, 2021 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Therefore, our retail sales demand is affected by the number of heating and cooling degree-days occurring during a year. Cooling degree-days typically have a more significant effect than heating degree-days since some residential customers do not use electricity to heat their homes. Additionally, our retail revenues are affected by regulated rates and riders, including the changes to our ESP, described in Note 2 - Regulatory Matters of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nHeating and Cooling Degree-days (a)\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>change </td> <td> </td> <td>% change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Actual </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Heating degree-days (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>4,855 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,867 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cooling degree-days (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1,300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,176 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>124 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>30-year average (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Heating-degree days </td> <td> </td> <td>5,434 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cooling-degree days </td> <td> </td> <td>996 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>995 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)Heating and cooling degree-days are a measure of the relative heating or cooling required for a home or business. The heating degrees in a day are calculated as the degrees that the average actual daily temperature is below 65 degrees Fahrenheit. For example, if the average temperature on March 20th was 40 degrees Fahrenheit, the heating degrees for that day would be the 25-degree difference between 65 degrees and 40 degrees. Similarly, cooling degrees in a day are calculated as the degrees that the average actual daily temperature is above 65 degrees Fahrenheit.\n(b)30-year average is computed from observed degree-days in the Dayton area on a trailing 30-year basis.\nDPL's and AES Ohio's electric sales and billed customers were as follows:\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ELECTRIC SALES AND CUSTOMERS (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>DPL and AES Ohio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>change </td> <td> </td> <td>% change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail electric sales (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential </td> <td> </td> <td>5,401 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,330 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.3% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial </td> <td> </td> <td>3,562 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,438 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>124 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.6% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial </td> <td> </td> <td>3,675 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,533 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>142 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Governmental </td> <td> </td> <td>1,179 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,148 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.3% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total retail electric sales </td> <td> </td> <td>13,837 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,468 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>369 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale electric sales (c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>493 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>450 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.6% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total electric sales </td> <td> </td> <td>14,330 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,918 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>412 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Billed electric customers (end of period) </td> <td> </td> <td>534,192 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>530,670 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,522 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.7% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)Electric sales are presented in millions of kWh.\n(b)DPL and AES Ohio retail electric sales represent the total transmission and distribution retail sales for the periods presented.

The increase was primarily the result of higher depreciable property, plant and equipment balances in the current year.\nDPL - Taxes Other Than Income Taxes\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, Taxes other than income taxes increased $2.7 million compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily the result of a favorable property tax true-up in the prior year, resulting from a new assessment from the state of Ohio.\nDPL - Loss on Disposal of Business\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, DPL recorded a Loss on disposal of business of $4.7 million due to the loss on the transfer of business interests in the Hutchings Coal Station.\nDPL - Interest Expense\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, Interest expense decreased $8.4 million compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily the result of the refinancing of debt at DPL in 2020.\nDPL - Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, DPL recorded a Loss on early extinguishment of debt of $31.7 million primarily due to the make-whole premium payment of $30.8 million related to the redemption of the $380.0 million 7.25% Notes due 2021 in the third quarter of 2020.\nDPL - Income Tax Expense From Continuing Operations\nIncome tax benefit decreased $5.0 million from $5.5 million in 2020 to $0.5 million in 2021. The decrease of $5.0 million was primarily due to income from continuing operations before income tax, less the reversal of excess deferred items, in the current year as compared to a loss from continuing operations before income tax, less the reversal of excess deferred items, in the prior year.\nDPL - Discontinued Operations\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, DPL recorded income / (loss) from discontinued operations (net of tax) of $(0.8) million and $5.4 million, respectively. This income / (loss) relates to the generation components of Stuart and Killen, which were retired in 2018 and sold in 2019, and Conesville, which was retired in May 2020 and sold in June 2020. See Part II, Item 8, Note 14 - Discontinued Operations in the Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENT - DPL\nDPL manages its business through one reportable operating segment, the Utility segment. The primary segment performance measure is income / (loss) from continuing operations before income tax as management has concluded that this measure best reflects the underlying business performance of DPL and is the most relevant measure considered in DPL's internal evaluation of the financial performance of its segments. The Utility segment is discussed further below:\nUtility Segment\nThe Utility segment is comprised primarily of AES Ohio's electric transmission and distribution businesses, which distribute electricity to residential, commercial, industrial and governmental customers. AES Ohio distributes electricity to more than 534,000 retail customers who are located in a 6,000-square mile area of West Central Ohio. AES Ohio's electric transmission and distribution businesses are subject to rate regulation by federal and state regulators. Accordingly, AES Ohio applies the accounting standards for regulated operations to its electric transmission and distribution businesses recording regulatory assets when incurred costs are expected to be recovered in future customer rates and regulatory liabilities when current cost recoveries in customer rates relate to expected future costs. The Utility segment includes revenues and costs associated with our investment in OVEC and the historical results of AES Ohio's Hutchings Coal Station, which was closed in 2013 and transferred to a third party in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nIncluded within the Other\u201d column are other businesses that do not meet the GAAP requirements for disclosure as reportable segments as well as certain corporate costs, which include interest expense and loss on early extinguishment of debt on DPL's long-term debt as well as adjustments related to purchase accounting from the Merger. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 1 - Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Intersegment sales, costs of sales and expenses are eliminated in consolidation. Certain shared and corporate costs are allocated between \"Other\" and the Utility reporting segment.\nSee Note 12 - Business Segments of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding DPL's reportable segment.\nThe following table presents DPL's Income / (loss) from continuing operations before income tax by business segment:\nTable 33:

For discussion comparing the results for the year ended December 31, 2020 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2019, see Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 24, 2021.\nAES Ohio - Revenues\nRetail customers, especially residential and commercial customers, consume more electricity on warmer and colder days. Therefore, our retail sales demand is affected by the number of heating and cooling degree-days occurring during a year. Cooling degree-days typically have a more significant effect than heating degree-days since some residential customers do not use electricity to heat their homes. Additionally, our retail revenues are affected by regulated rates and riders, including the changes to our ESP, described in Note 2 - Regulatory Matters of Notes to AES Ohio's Financial Statements.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, Revenues increased $11.6 million to $663.7 million from $652.1 million in the same period of the prior year.

The increase was primarily the result of higher depreciable property, plant and equipment balances in the current year.\nAES Ohio - Taxes Other Than Income Taxes\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, Taxes other than income taxes increased $2.8 million compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily the result of a favorable property tax true-up in the prior year, resulting from a new assessment from the state of Ohio.\nAES Ohio - Loss on Disposal of Business\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, AES Ohio recorded a Loss on disposal of business of $4.7 million due to the loss on the transfer of business interests in the Hutchings Coal Station.\nAES Ohio - Income Tax Expense\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, Income tax expense decreased $1.3 million from $7.0 million in 2020 to $5.7 million in 2021 primarily due to a decrease in income before income tax compared to the prior year.\nKEY TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nDuring 2022 and beyond, we expect that our financial results will be driven primarily by retail demand and weather. As discussed in Note 2 - Regulatory Matters of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 2 - Regulatory Matters of Notes to AES Ohio's Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report, AES Ohio has requested PUCO approval to defer its decoupling costs consistent with the methodology approved in its distribution rate order. If approved, the deferral would be effective as of December 18, 2019 and going forward would reduce impacts of weather, energy efficiency programs and economic changes in customer demand. In addition, DPL's and AES Ohio's financial results are likely to be driven by other factors including, but not limited to:\n\u2022regulatory outcomes;\n\u2022the passage of new legislation, implementation of regulations or other changes in regulations; and\n\u2022timely recovery of transmission and distribution expenditures.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted global economic activity, including electricity and energy consumption, and caused significant volatility in financial markets. Responses to the COVID-19 pandemic by the State of Ohio and its residents and businesses continue to evolve as virus variants emerge, vaccine availability and usage continues and the state and businesses review and adjust the scope and requirements of social distancing measures.\nSocial distancing measures designed to slow the spread of the virus, such as business closures and operations limitations, impact energy demand within our service industry. In addition to the impacts to demand within our service territory, we also have incurred and expect to continue to incur expenses relating to COVID-19, and such expenses may include those that relate to events outside of our control. We experienced impacts from the pandemic in 2021 and into 2022 and expect to continue to experience impacts for the remainder of 2022. The following discussion highlights our assessment of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our current financial and operating status, and our financial and operational outlook based on information known as of this filing. Any impacts in future periods could have material and adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Also see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" of this Form 10-K.\nBusiness Continuity - During the COVID-19 pandemic, we are taking a variety of measures to ensure our ability to transmit, distribute and sell electric energy, to ensure the health and safety of our employees, contractors, customers and communities and to provide essential services to the communities in which we operate. We continue to respond to this global crisis through comprehensive measures to protect our employees and others while fulfilling our vital role in providing our customers with electric energy.
