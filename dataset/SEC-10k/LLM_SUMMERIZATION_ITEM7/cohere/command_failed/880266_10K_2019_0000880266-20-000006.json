Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWe are a leading manufacturer and distributor of agricultural equipment and related replacement parts throughout the world. We sell a full range of agricultural equipment, including tractors, combines, self-propelled sprayers, hay tools, forage equipment, seeding and tillage equipment, implements, and grain storage and protein production systems. Our products are widely recognized in the agricultural equipment industry and are marketed under a number of well-known brand names, including: Challenger\u00ae, Fendt\u00ae, GSI\u00ae, Massey Ferguson\u00ae and Valtra\u00ae. We distribute most of our products through a combination of approximately 3,275 dealers and distributors as well as associates and licensees. In addition, we provide retail financing through our finance joint ventures with Rabobank.\nFinancial Highlights\nWe sell our equipment and replacement parts to our independent dealers, distributors and other customers. A large majority of our sales are to independent dealers and distributors that sell our products to end users. To the extent practicable, we attempt to sell products to our dealers and distributors on a level basis throughout the year to reduce the effect of seasonal demands on our manufacturing operations and to minimize our investment in inventories. However, retail sales by dealers to farmers are highly seasonal and are linked to the planting and harvesting seasons. In certain markets, particularly in North America, there is often a time lag, which varies based on the timing and level of retail demand, between our sale of the equipment to the dealer and the dealer's sale to a retail customer.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage relationship to net sales of certain items included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations: Table 41: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>78.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>21.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Engineering expenses\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment charges\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangibles\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring expenses\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bad debt expense\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from operations\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense, net\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes and equity in net earnings of affiliates\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax provision\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before equity in net earnings of affiliates\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in net earnings of affiliates\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to AGCO Corporation and subsidiaries\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________________________________\n(1) Rounding may impact summation of amounts.\n2019 Compared to 2018\nNet income attributable to AGCO Corporation and subsidiaries for 2019 was $125.2 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, compared to $285.5 million, or $3.58 per diluted share for 2018.\nNet sales for 2019 were approximately $9,041.4 million, or 3.3% lower than 2018, primarily due to decreased sales volumes in our South American and Asia/Pacific/African ( APA\u201d) regions and the negative impact of currency translation. Income from operations was $348.1 million in 2019 compared to $489.0 million in 2018. The decrease in income from operations during 2019 was primarily the result of non-cash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges recorded during the fourth quarter of 2019 related to our grain storage and protein production systems operations in our Europe/Middle East ( EME\u201d) region. Excluding the impact of $176.6 million of non-cash impairment charges, income from operations during 2019 increased compared to 2018 due to improved gross profit margins, which largely offset the adverse impact of foreign currency translation.\nRegionally, income from operations in EME increased by approximately $37.1 million in 2019 compared to 2018, driven primarily by the benefit of higher sales and margin improvement resulting from the impacts of pricing, better factory productivity and a favorable sales mix. In our North American region, income from operations improved by approximately $18.5 million. Increased net sales levels and the benefit of favorable pricing impacts and expense control initiatives contributed to the improvement in the region. In South America, operating losses increased approximately $29.3 million in 2019 compared to 2018. The losses reflect low levels of industry demand and company production, as well as unfavorable cost impacts of newer product technology into our Brazilian factories. Income from operations in our APA region decreased approximately $6.2 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to lower net sales and production volumes.\nIndustry Market Conditions\nFarm economics remain challenged across the major crop-producing regions, and low commodity prices and international trade tensions continue to weigh on farmer sentiment, resulting in decreased global equipment demand during 2019. In North America, industry unit retail sales of utility and high horsepower tractors for 2019 decreased slightly compared to 2018. Industry unit retail sales of combines for 2019 decreased approximately 6% compared to 2018. A difficult growing season, as well as the uncertainty regarding the outcome of trade negotiations related to agricultural products and delayed market facilitation aid payments in the U.S., all contributed to weak demand in the large farm sector during 2019. In Western Europe, industry unit retail sales of tractors for 2019 declined approximately 2% compared to 2018. Industry unit retail sales of combines for 2019 decreased approximately 18% compared to 2018. Industry demand trended progressively lower throughout 2019 due to the impact of lower wheat and milk prices as well as higher input costs for dairy producers. During 2019, industry sales declines experienced in Italy, the United Kingdom and Germany were partially offset by industry sales growth in France and Finland. In South America, industry unit retail sales of tractors for 2019 dropped approximately 16% compared to 2018. Industry unit retail sales of combines for 2019 decreased approximately 5% compared to 2018. Despite improved grain production in Brazil and Argentina, industry demand was negatively impacted by interruptions in the government subsidized finance program in Brazil and weak economic conditions in Argentina.\nResults of Operations\nNet sales for 2019 were $9,041.4 million compared to $9,352.0 million for 2018, primarily as a result of sales declines in our South American and APA regions, partially offset by sales growth in our North American and EME regions, on a constant currency basis. The following table sets forth, for the year ended December 31, 2019, the impact to net sales of currency translation by geographical segment (in millions, except percentages): Table 42: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change due to Currency Translation\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,191.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,180.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>South America\n</td> <td>802.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>959.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(156.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(49.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EME\n</td> <td>5,328.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,385.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(56.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(295.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>APA\n</td> <td>718.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>827.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(109.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(35.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,041.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,352.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(310.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(389.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRegionally, net sales in North America increased during 2019 compared to 2018, with sales growth driven by a growth in net sales of low horsepower tractors, combines and parts, largely offset by a reduction in sales of protein production equipment and utility tractors. In the EME region, net sales, excluding the negative impact of foreign currency translation, increased during 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to net sales growth in France, Germany and Italy, partially offset by declines in the United Kingdom and Eastern Europe. Net sales decreased in South America in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to weaker industry conditions resulting in sales declines in Brazil and other South American markets as well as the negative impact of foreign currency translation. In the APA region, net sales decreased in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to lower sales in China, Southeast Asia and Africa. We estimate that worldwide average price increases were approximately 1.9% and 1.4% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Consolidated net sales of tractors and combines, which comprised approximately 61% of our net sales in 2019, decreased approximately 3.7% in 2019 compared to 2018. Unit sales of tractors and combines decreased approximately 9.5% during 2019 compared to 2018. The unit sales decrease and the decrease in net sales can differ due to foreign currency translation, pricing and sales mix changes.\nThe following table sets forth, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the percentage relationship to net sales of certain items included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations (in millions, except percentages): Table 43: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nNet Sales(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nNet Sales\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,984.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,996.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>1,040.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,069.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Engineering expenses\n</td> <td>343.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>355.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment charges\n</td> <td>176.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangibles\n</td> <td>61.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring expenses\n</td> <td>9.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bad debt expense\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>348.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>489.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________________________\n(1) Rounding may impact summation of amounts.\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales increased during 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the benefit of pricing in excess of material cost increases, partially offset by the cost impact of lower production levels. Production hours decreased in both North America and South America, while production hours increased in Europe during 2019. Overall, production hours decreased approximately 2% on a global basis during 2019 compared to 2018. We recorded stock compensation expense of approximately $1.7 million and $2.3 million during 2019 and 2018, respectively, within cost of goods sold, as is more fully explained in Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nSelling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A expenses\u201d) and engineering expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were relatively flat during 2019 compared to 2018. We recorded stock compensation expense of approximately $40.0 million and $44.3 million during 2019 and 2018, respectively, within SG&A expenses, as is more fully explained in Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nWe recorded restructuring expenses of approximately $9.0 million and $12.0 million during 2019 and 2018, respectively. The restructuring expenses primarily related to severance and related costs associated with the rationalization of employee headcount at various manufacturing facilities and administrative offices located in Europe, South America, China, Africa and the United States during 2019, as well as the rationalization of our grain storage and protein production systems operations initiated in the fourth quarter of 2019. In addition, we recorded a loss of approximately $2.1 million within \"Restructuring expenses\" associated with the sale of our 50% interest in our USC, LLC joint venture. See Note 3 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d for additional information.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2019, we recorded non-cash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of approximately $173.6 million associated with our grain storage and protein production systems operations in Europe/Middle East, as well as the impairment of long-lived intangible assets of approximately $3.0 million associated with brand and product rationalization within our grain storage and protein production systems operations in North\nAmerica. These impairment charges are more fully described in Critical Accounting Estimates - Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets\u201d and Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nInterest expense, net was $19.9 million for 2019 compared to $53.8 million for 2018. The decline was primarily the result of debt extinguishment costs incurred in 2018 associated with debt refinancings completed during 2018 that included the replacement of higher interest-bearing debt with lower interest-bearing debt. During 2018, we repurchased approximately $300.0 million of our outstanding 57/8% senior notes. The repurchase resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $24.5 million, including associated fees, offset by approximately $4.7 million of accelerated amortization of a deferred gain related to a terminated interest rate swap instrument associated with the senior notes. In addition, we repaid our outstanding term loan under our former revolving credit and term loan facility. We recorded approximately $0.7 million associated with the write-off of deferred debt issuance costs and a loss of approximately $3.9 million from a terminated interest rate swap instrument related to the term loan.\nOther expense, net was $67.1 million in 2019 compared to $74.9 million in 2018. Losses on sales of receivables, primarily related to our accounts receivable sales agreements with our finance joint ventures in North America, Europe and Brazil, were approximately $42.4 million and $36.0 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Other expense, net for 2018 also included higher foreign exchanges losses, primarily associated with the significant devaluation of the Argentine peso.\nWe recorded an income tax provision of $180.8 million in 2019 compared to $110.9 million in 2018. Our tax provision and effective tax rate are impacted by the differing tax rates of the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, permanent differences for items treated differently for financial accounting and income tax purposes and for losses in jurisdictions where no income tax benefit is recorded. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had gross deferred tax assets of $396.0 million and $350.2 million, respectively, including $72.0 million and $74.5 million, respectively, related to net operating loss carryforwards. During 2019, we recognized a one-time income tax gain of approximately $21.8 million associated with the changing of Swiss federal and cantonal tax rates, as well as recognition of a deferred tax asset associated with the estimated value of a tax basis step-up of our Swiss subsidiary's assets. During 2019, we also recorded a non-cash adjustment to establish a valuation allowance against our Brazilian net deferred income tax assets of approximately $53.7 million. At December 31, 2019, we had total valuation allowances as an offset to our gross deferred tax assets of approximately $169.1 million. This valuation allowance included allowances primarily against net operating loss carryforwards in Brazil, China, Hungary, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, as well as allowances against our net deferred taxes primarily in the U.S. and Brazil. At December 31, 2018, we had total valuation allowances as an offset to the gross deferred tax assets of approximately $83.9 million, primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards in Brazil, China, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, as well as allowances against our net deferred taxes in the U.S. Realization of the net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2019 will depend on generating sufficient taxable income in future periods, net of reversing deferred tax liabilities. We believe it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized. Refer to Note 6 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d for further information.\nEquity in net earnings of affiliates, which is primarily comprised of income from our AGCO Finance joint ventures, was $42.5 million in 2019 compared to $34.3 million in 2018, primarily due to higher net earnings from our AGCO Finance joint ventures.

The joint ventures are owned by AGCO and by a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rabobank. The majority of the assets of the finance joint ventures consist of finance receivables. The majority of the liabilities consist of notes payable and accrued interest. Under the various joint venture agreements, Rabobank or its affiliates provide financing to the finance joint ventures, primarily through lines of credit. We do not guarantee the debt obligations of the joint ventures. As of December 31, 2019, our capital investment in the finance joint ventures, which is included in Investment in affiliates\u201d on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, was approximately $339.0 million compared to $358.7 million as of December 31, 2018. The total finance portfolio in our finance joint ventures was approximately $9.6 billion and $8.8 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The total finance portfolio as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 included approximately $7.7 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively, of retail receivables and $1.9 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, of wholesale receivables from AGCO dealers. The wholesale receivables either were sold directly to AGCO Finance without recourse from our operating companies or AGCO Finance provided the financing directly to the dealers. During 2019 and 2018, we did not make additional investments in our finance joint ventures. During 2019 and 2018, we received dividends of approximately $40.5 million and $29.4 million, respectively, from certain of our finance joint ventures. Our share in the earnings of the finance joint ventures, included in Equity in net earnings of affiliates\u201d within our Consolidated Statements of Operations, was $41.5 million and $34.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, with the increase in earnings primarily due to higher income in our European, Brazilian and U.S. finance joint ventures during 2019 as compared to 2018.\nOutlook\nOur operations are subject to the cyclical nature of the agricultural industry. Sales of our equipment are affected by, among other things, changes in net cash farm income, farm land values, weather conditions, the demand for agricultural commodities, commodity prices and general economic conditions.\nOur net sales are expected to increase in 2020 compared to 2019, resulting from relatively flat net sales volumes and positive pricing impacts. Gross and operating margins are expected to improve from 2019 levels, reflecting the positive impact of pricing and cost control initiatives. This assumes that the coronavirus outbreak does not significantly impact our business. See, Risk Factors.\u201d\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur financing requirements are subject to variations due to seasonal changes in inventory and receivable levels. Internally generated funds are supplemented when necessary from external sources, primarily our credit facility and accounts receivable sales agreement facilities. We believe that the following facilities, together with available cash and internally generated funds, will be sufficient to support our working capital, capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future (in millions): Table 45: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1.002% Senior term loan due 2025(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>280.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior term loan due 2022(1)\n</td> <td>168.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit facility, expires 2023\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior term loans due between 2021 and 2028(1)\n</td> <td>736.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term debt\n</td> <td>12.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________________________\n(1) The amounts above are gross of debt issuance costs of an aggregate amount of approximately $2.3 million.\nInterest on U.S. dollar borrowings under our credit facility is calculated based upon LIBOR. In the event that LIBOR is no longer published, interest will be calculated based upon a base rate. The credit facility also provides for an expedited amendment process once a replacement for LIBOR is established.\nIn December 2018, we entered into a term loan agreement with the European Investment Bank ( EIB\u201d), which provided us with the ability to borrow up to \u20ac250.0 million. The \u20ac250.0 million (or approximately $280.2 million as of December 31, 2019) of funding was received on January 25, 2019 with a maturity date of January 24, 2025. We have the ability to prepay the term loan before its maturity date. Interest is payable on the term loan at 1.002% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears. We had an additional term loan with the EIB in the amount of \u20ac200.0 million that was entered into in December 2014 and had a maturity date of January 15, 2020. We repaid this \u20ac200.0 million (or approximately $220.0 million) term loan in December 2019.\nIn October 2018, we entered into a term loan agreement with Rabobank in the amount of \u20ac150.0 million (or approximately $168.1 million as of December 31, 2019). We have the ability to prepay the term loan before its maturity date on October 28, 2022. Interest is payable on the term loan quarterly in arrears at an annual rate, equal to the EURIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.875% to 1.875% based on our credit rating.\nIn October 2018, we entered into a multi-currency revolving credit facility of $800.0 million. The maturity date of the credit facility is October 17, 2023. Interest accrues on amounts outstanding under the credit facility, at our option, at either (1) LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.875% to 1.875% based on our credit rating, or (2) the base rate, which is equal to the higher of (i) the administrative agent's base lending rate for the applicable currency, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, and (iii) one-month LIBOR for loans denominated in U.S. dollars plus 1.0%, plus a margin ranging from 0.0% to 0.875% based on our credit rating.\nIn October 2016, we borrowed an aggregate amount of \u20ac375.0 million through a group of seven related term loan agreements. These agreements had maturities ranging from October 2019 to October 2026. In October 2019, we repaid an aggregate amount of \u20ac56.0 million (or approximately $61.1 million) of these term loans. In August 2018, we borrowed an additional aggregate amount of indebtedness of \u20ac338.0 million through a group of another seven related term loan agreements. Proceeds from the borrowings were used to repay borrowings under our former revolving credit facility. The provisions of the term loan agreements are identical in nature with the exception of interest rate terms and maturities. In aggregate, as of\nDecember 31, 2019, we have indebtedness of approximately \u20ac657.0 million (or approximately $736.2 million) under a total group of twelve term loan agreements with remaining maturities ranging from August 2021 to August 2028.\nWe are in compliance with the financial covenants contained in these facilities and expect to continue to maintain such compliance. Should we ever encounter difficulties, our historical relationship with our lenders has been strong and we anticipate their continued long-term support of our business. Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d for additional information regarding our current facilities, including the financial covenants contained in each debt instrument.\nOur accounts receivable sales agreements in North America, Europe and Brazil permit the sale, on an ongoing basis, of a majority of our receivables to our U.S., Canadian, European and Brazilian finance joint ventures. The sales of all receivables are without recourse to us. We do not service the receivables after the sales occur, and we do not maintain any direct retained interest in the receivables. These agreements are accounted for as off-balance sheet transactions and have the effect of reducing accounts receivable and short-term liabilities by the same amount. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the cash received from receivables sold under the U.S., Canadian, European and Brazilian accounts receivable sales agreements was approximately $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.\nOur finance joint ventures in Europe, Brazil and Australia also provide wholesale financing directly to our dealers. The receivables associated with these arrangements also are without recourse to us. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, these finance joint ventures had approximately $104.3 million and $82.5 million, respectively, of outstanding accounts receivable associated with these arrangements. These arrangements are accounted for as off-balance sheet transactions. In addition, we sell certain trade receivables under factoring arrangements to other financial institutions around the world. These arrangements also are accounted for as off-balance sheet transactions.\nOur debt to capitalization ratio, which is total indebtedness divided by the sum of total indebtedness and stockholders' equity, was 30.4% at December 31, 2019 compared to 32.8% at December 31, 2018.\nCash Flows\nCash flows provided by operating activities were $695.9 million during 2019 compared to $595.9 million during 2018 and $577.6 million during 2017. The increase during 2019 was primarily due to a source of cash in operating assets and liabilities in 2019 compared to a use of cash in 2018. In addition, we received an increased amount of dividends from our finance joint ventures in 2019 as compared to 2018.\nOur working capital requirements are seasonal, with investments in working capital typically building in the first half of the year and then reducing in the second half of the year. We had $844.6 million in working capital at December 31, 2019, as compared with $770.7 million at December 31, 2018. Accounts receivable and inventories, combined, at December 31, 2019 were $90.2 million higher than at December 31, 2018. Inventories as of December 31, 2019 included stock related to the transition of production to products meeting new emissions standards in Europe. Weaker market conditions in many key markets contributed to lower net sales and resulting higher finished goods inventories as compared to 2018.\nShare Repurchase Program\nDuring 2019 and 2018, we repurchased 1,794,256 and 3,120,184 shares of our common stock, respectively, for approximately $130.0 million and $184.3 million, respectively, either through Accelerated Share Repurchase ( ASR\u201d) agreements with financial institutions or through open market transactions. All shares received were retired upon receipt, and the excess of the purchase price over par value per share was recorded to a combination of Additional paid-in capital\u201d and \"Retained Earnings\" within our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIn February 2020, we entered into an ASR agreement with a financial institution to repurchase an aggregate of $25.0 million of shares of our common stock. We received approximately 297,000 shares to date in this transaction. Upon settlement of the ASR, we may be entitled to receive additional shares of common stock or, under certain circumstances, be required to remit a settlement amount. We expect that the additional shares will be received by us upon final settlement of our current ASR agreement, which expires during the second quarter of 2020.\nContractual Obligations\nThe future payments required under our significant contractual obligations, excluding foreign currency option and forward contracts, as of December 31, 2019 are as follows (in millions): Table 46: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due By Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021 to 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2023 to 2024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2025 and Beyond\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Indebtedness(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,270.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>468.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>280.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>445.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments related to indebtedness(2)\n</td> <td>57.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>18.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>223.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unconditional purchase obligations\n</td> <td>127.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other short-term and long-term obligations(3)\n</td> <td>296.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,993.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>337.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>699.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>388.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>568.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021 to 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2023 to 2024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2025 and Beyond\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standby letters of credit and similar instruments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Guarantees\n</td> <td>66.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total commercial commitments and letters of credit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Indebtedness amounts reflect the principal amount of our senior term loan, senior notes and credit facility.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Estimated interest payments are calculated assuming current interest rates over minimum maturity periods specified in debt agreements.

Other short-term and long-term obligations also include income tax liabilities related to uncertain income tax positions connected with ongoing income tax audits in various jurisdictions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nGuarantees\nWe maintain a remarketing agreement with our finance joint venture in the United States, whereby we are obligated to repurchase up to $6.0 million of repossessed equipment each calendar year. We believe any losses that might be incurred on the resale of this equipment will not materially impact our financial position or results of operations, due to the fact that the repurchase obligation would be equivalent to the fair value of the underlying equipment.\nAt December 31, 2019, we guaranteed indebtedness owed to third parties of approximately $47.6 million, primarily related to dealer and end-user financing of equipment. Such guarantees generally obligate us to repay outstanding finance obligations owed to financial institutions if dealers or end users default on such loans through 2025. Losses under such guarantees historically have been insignificant. In addition, we generally would expect to be able to recover a significant portion of the amounts paid under such guarantees from the sale of the underlying financed farm equipment, as the fair value of such equipment is expected to offset a substantial portion of the amounts paid. We also have obligations to guarantee indebtedness owed to certain of our finance joint ventures if dealers or end users default on loans. Losses under such guarantees historically have been insignificant and the guarantees are not material. We believe the credit risk associated with all of these guarantees is not material to our financial position or results of operations.\nIn addition, at December 31, 2019, we had accrued approximately $18.9 million of outstanding guarantees of minimum residual values that may be owed to our finance joint ventures in the United States and Canada due upon expiration of certain eligible operating leases between the finance joint ventures and end users. The maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantee is approximately $26.7 million.\nOther\nAt December 31, 2019, we had outstanding designated and non-designated foreign exchange contracts with a gross notional amount of approximately $3,133.0 million. The outstanding contracts as of December 31, 2019 range in maturity through December 2020.\nAs discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources,\u201d we sell a majority of our wholesale accounts receivable in North America, Europe and Brazil to our U.S., Canadian, European and Brazilian finance joint ventures. We also sell certain accounts receivable under factoring arrangements to financial institutions around the world. We have determined that these facilities should be accounted for as off-balance sheet transactions.\nContingencies\nWe are party to various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business. We closely monitor these claims and lawsuits and frequently consult with our legal counsel to determine whether they may, when resolved, have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations and accrue and/or disclose loss contingencies as appropriate. See Note 12 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d and Item 3, Legal Proceedings,\u201d for further information.\nRelated Parties\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company engages in transactions with related parties. See Note 14 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d for information regarding related party transactions and their impact to our consolidated results of operations and financial position.\nForeign Currency Risk Management\nWe have significant manufacturing locations in the United States, France, Germany, Finland, Italy, China and Brazil, and we purchase a portion of our tractors, combines and components from third-party foreign suppliers, primarily in various European countries and in Japan. We also sell products in approximately 140 countries throughout the world. The majority of our net sales outside the United States are denominated in the currency of the customer location, with the exception of sales in Middle East, Africa, Asia and parts of South America, where net sales are primarily denominated in British pounds, Euros, or the United States dollar.\nWe manage our transactional foreign currency exposure by hedging foreign currency cash flow forecasts and commitments arising from the anticipated settlement of receivables and payables and from future purchases and sales. Where naturally offsetting currency positions do not occur, we hedge certain, but not all, of our exposures through the use of foreign currency contracts. Our translation exposure resulting from translating the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries into United States dollars may be partially hedged from time to time. When practical, this translation impact is reduced by financing local operations with local borrowings. Our hedging policy prohibits use of foreign currency contracts for speculative trading purposes.\nThe total notional value of our foreign currency instruments was $3,133.0 million and $1,462.8 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, inclusive of both those instruments that are designated and qualified for hedge accounting and non-designated derivative instruments. We enter into cash flow hedges to minimize the variability in cash flows of assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and we enter into foreign currency contracts to economically hedge receivables and payables on our balance sheets that are denominated in foreign currencies other than the functional currency. In addition, we use derivative and non-derivative instruments to hedge a portion of our net investment in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. See Note 11 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d for further information about our hedging transactions and derivative instruments.\nAssuming a 10% change relative to the currency of the hedge contracts, the fair value of the foreign currency instruments could be negatively impacted by approximately $22.3 million as of December 31, 2019. Due to the fact that these instruments are primarily entered into for hedging purposes, the gains or losses on the contracts would largely be offset by losses and gains on the underlying firm commitment or forecasted transaction.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur interest expense is, in part, sensitive to the general level of interest rates. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through our mix of floating rate and fixed rate debt. From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. See Notes 7 and 11 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d for additional information about our interest rate swap agreements.\nBased on our floating rate debt and our accounts receivable sales facilities outstanding at December 31, 2019, a 10% increase in interest rates, would have increased, collectively, Interest expense, net\u201d and Other expense, net\u201d for the year ended December 31, 2019 by approximately $5.6 million.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their impact to our consolidated results of operations and financial position.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In the preparation of these financial statements, we make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the financial statements are detailed in Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d We believe that our application of the policies discussed below involves significant levels of judgment, estimates and complexity.\nDue to the levels of judgment, complexity and period of time over which many of these items are resolved, actual results could differ from those estimated at the time of preparation of the financial statements. Adjustments to these estimates would impact our financial position and future results of operations.\nDiscount and Sales Incentive Allowances\nWe provide various volume bonus and sales incentive programs with respect to our products. These sales incentive programs include reductions in invoice prices, reductions in retail financing rates, dealer commissions and dealer incentive allowances. In most cases, incentive programs are established and communicated to our dealers on a quarterly basis. The incentives are paid either at the time of the cash settlement of the receivable (which is generally at the time of retail sale), at the time of retail financing, at the time of warranty registration, or at a subsequent time based on dealer purchase volumes. The incentive programs are product line specific and generally do not vary by dealer. The cost of sales incentives associated with dealer commissions and dealer incentive allowances is estimated based upon the terms of the programs and historical experience, is based on a percentage of the sales price, and estimates for sales incentives are made and recorded at the time of sale for expected incentive programs using the expected value method. These estimates are reassessed each reporting period and are revised in the event of subsequent modifications to incentive programs, as they are communicated to dealers. The related provisions and accruals are made on a product or product-line basis and are monitored for adequacy and revised at least quarterly in the event of subsequent modifications to the programs. Interest rate subsidy payments, which are a reduction in retail financing rates, are recorded in the same manner as dealer commissions and dealer incentive allowances. Volume discounts are estimated and recognized based on historical experience, and related reserves are monitored and adjusted based on actual dealer purchase volumes and the dealers' progress towards achieving specified cumulative target levels. Estimates of these incentives are based on the terms of the programs and historical experience. All incentive programs are recorded and presented as a reduction of revenue, due to the fact that we do not receive a distinct good or service in exchange for the consideration provided. In the United States and Canada, reserves for incentive programs related to accounts receivable not sold to our U.S. and Canadian finance joint ventures are recorded as accounts receivable allowances\u201d within our Consolidated Balance Sheets due to the fact that the incentives are paid through a reduction of future cash settlement of the receivable. Globally, reserves for incentive programs that will be paid in cash or credit memos, as is the case with most of our volume discount programs, as well as sales incentives associated with accounts receivable sold to our finance joint ventures, are recorded within Accrued expenses\u201d within our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had recorded an allowance for discounts and sales incentives of approximately $606.1 million that will be paid either through a reduction of future cash settlements of receivables and through credit memos\nto our dealers or through reductions in retail financing rates paid to our finance joint ventures. If we were to allow an additional 1% of sales incentives and discounts at the time of retail sale for those sales subject to such discount programs, our reserve would increase by approximately $21.0 million as of December 31, 2019. Conversely, if we were to decrease our sales incentives and discounts by 1% at the time of retail sale, our reserve would decrease by approximately $21.0 million as of December 31, 2019.\nDeferred Income Taxes and Uncertain Income Tax Positions\nWe recorded an income tax provision of $180.8 million in 2019 compared to $110.9 million in 2018 and $133.6 million in 2017. Our tax provision and effective tax rate are impacted by the differing tax rates of the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, permanent differences for items treated differently for financial accounting and income tax purposes, and for losses in jurisdictions where no income tax benefit is recorded.\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, we recorded a non-cash adjustment to establish a valuation allowance against our Brazilian net deferred income tax assets of approximately $53.7 million. In addition, we maintain a valuation allowance to fully reserve against our net deferred tax assets in the United States and certain other foreign jurisdictions. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We assessed the likelihood that our deferred tax assets would be recovered from estimated future taxable income and available tax planning strategies and determined that the adjustment to the valuation allowance was appropriate. In making this assessment, all available evidence was considered including the current economic climate, as well as reasonable tax planning strategies. We believe it is more likely than not that we will realize our remaining net deferred tax assets, net of the valuation allowance, in future years.\nSwiss tax reform was enacted during 2019 and eliminates certain preferential tax items as well as implements new tax rates at both the federal and cantonal levels. During the three months ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized a one-time income tax gain of approximately $21.8 million associated with the changing of Swiss federal and cantonal tax rates as well as recognition of a deferred tax asset associated with the estimated value of a tax basis step-up of our Swiss subsidiary's assets.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( the 2017 Tax Act\u201d) was enacted in the United States. During the three months ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a tax provision of approximately $42.0 million in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which provided SEC Staff guidance for the application of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 740 Income Taxes,\u201d in the reporting period in which the 2017 Tax Act was enacted. The $42.0 million tax provision included a provisional income tax charge related to a one-time transition tax associated with the mandatory deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. The tax provision also included a provisional income tax charge associated with the income tax consequences related to the expected future repatriation of certain underlying foreign earnings, as historically, we have considered them to be permanently reinvested. The remaining balance of the tax provision primarily related to the remeasurement of certain net deferred tax assets using the lower enacted U.S. Corporate tax rate (from 35% to 21%), as well as other miscellaneous related impacts. During the three months ended December 31, 2018, we finalized our calculations related to the 2017 Tax Act and recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $8.4 million.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had gross deferred tax assets of $396.0 million and $350.2 million, respectively, including $72.0 million and $74.5 million, respectively, related to net operating loss carryforwards. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had total valuation allowances as an offset to our gross deferred tax assets of $169.1 million and $83.9 million, respectively, which included allowances primarily against net operating loss carryforwards in Brazil, China, Hungary, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, as well as allowances against our net deferred taxes primarily in the U.S. and Brazil, as previously discussed. Realization of the remaining deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2019 will depend on generating sufficient taxable income in future periods, net of reversing deferred tax liabilities. We believe it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized.\nWe recognize income tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only when there is a more than 50% likelihood that the tax positions will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the positions. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had approximately $210.7 million and $166.1 million, respectively, of gross unrecognized tax benefits, all of which would impact our effective tax rate if recognized. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had approximately $51.0 million and $58.5 million, respectively, of current accrued taxes related to uncertain income tax positions connected with ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions that we expect to settle or pay in the next 12 months. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $28.4 million and $27.2 million, respectively. See Note 6 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our uncertain income tax positions.\nPensions\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees, principally in the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, Switzerland, Finland, France, Norway and Argentina. Our primary plans cover certain employees in the United States and the United Kingdom.\nIn the United States, we sponsor a funded, qualified defined benefit pension plan for our salaried employees, as well as a separate funded qualified defined benefit pension plan for our hourly employees. Both plans are closed to new entrants and frozen, and we fund at least the minimum contributions required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code to both plans. In addition, we maintain an unfunded, nonqualified defined benefit pension plan for certain senior executives, which is our Executive Nonqualified Pension Plan ( ENPP\u201d). The ENPP is also closed to new entrants.\nIn the United Kingdom, we sponsor a funded defined benefit pension plan that provides an annuity benefit based on participants' final average earnings and service. Participation in this plan is limited to certain older, longer service employees and existing retirees. This plan is closed to new participants.\nSee Note 8 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d for additional information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits.\nNature of Estimates Required. The measurement date for all of our benefit plans is December 31. The measurement of our pension obligations, costs and liabilities is dependent on a variety of assumptions provided by management and used by our actuaries. These assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience. These assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions.\nAssumptions and Approach Used. The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include, but are not limited to, the following key factors: Table 50: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022 Discount rates\n</td> <td>\u2022 Inflation\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022 Salary growth\n</td> <td>\u2022 Expected return on plan assets\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022 Retirement rates and ages\n</td> <td>\u2022 Mortality rates\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we used a globally consistent methodology to set the discount rate in the countries where our largest benefit obligations exist. In the United States, the United Kingdom and the Euro Zone, we constructed a hypothetical bond portfolio of high-quality corporate bonds and then applied the cash flows of our benefit plans to those bond yields to derive a discount rate. The bond portfolio and plan-specific cash flows vary by country, but the methodology in which the portfolio is constructed is consistent. In the United States, the bond portfolio is large enough to result in taking a settlement approach\u201d to derive the discount rate, in which high-quality corporate bonds are assumed to be purchased and the resulting coupon payments and maturities are used to satisfy our U.S. pension plans' projected benefit payments. In the United Kingdom and the Euro Zone, the discount rate is derived using a yield curve approach,\u201d in which an individual spot rate, or zero coupon bond yield, for each future annual period is developed to discount each future benefit payment and, thereby, determine the present value of all future payments. The Company uses a spot yield curve to determine the discount rate applicable in the United Kingdom to measure the U.K. pension plan's service cost and interest cost. Under the settlement and yield curve approaches, the discount rate is set to equal the single discount rate that produces the same present value of all future payments.\nThe other key assumptions and methods were set as follows:\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The salary growth assumptions reflect our long-term actual experience, the near-term outlook and assumed inflation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The expected return on plan asset assumptions reflects asset allocations, investment strategy, historical experience and the views of investment managers, and reflects a projection of the expected arithmetic returns over ten years.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Determination of retirement rates and ages as well as termination rates, based on actual plan experience, actuarial standards of practice and the manner in which our defined benefit plans are being administered.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The mortality rates for the U.K. defined benefit pension plan was updated in 2019 to reflect the latest expected improvements in the life expectancy of the plan participants. The mortality rates for the U.S. defined benefit pension plans were updated in 2019 to reflect the Society of Actuaries' most recent findings on the topic of mortality.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The fair value of assets used to determine the expected return on assets does not reflect any delayed recognition of asset gains and losses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such periods.\nOur U.S. and U.K. defined benefit pension plans, including our ENPP, comprised approximately 86% of our consolidated projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2019. If the discount rate used to determine the 2019 projected benefit obligation for our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans and our ENPP was decreased by 25 basis points, our projected benefit obligation would have increased by approximately $4.8 million at December 31, 2019, and our 2020 pension expense would increase by approximately $0.5 million. If the discount rate used to determine the 2019 projected benefit obligation for our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans and our ENPP was increased by 25 basis points, our projected benefit obligation would have decreased by approximately $4.5 million at December 31, 2019, and our 2020 pension expense would decrease by approximately $0.5 million. If the discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for our U.K. defined benefit pension plan was decreased by 25 basis points, our projected benefit obligation would have increased by approximately $25.3 million at December 31, 2019, and our 2020 pension expense would increase by approximately $0.2 million. If the discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for our U.K. defined benefit pension plan was increased by 25 basis points, our projected benefit obligation would have decreased by approximately $23.1 million at December 31, 2019, and our 2020 pension expense would decrease by approximately $0.3 million. In addition, if the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets related to our U.K. defined benefit pension plan was increased or decreased by 25 basis points, our 2020 pension expense would decrease or increase by approximately $1.6 million each, respectively. The impact to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans for a 25-basis-point change in our expected long-term rate of return would decrease or increase our 2020 pension expense by approximately $0.1 million, respectively.\nUnrecognized actuarial net losses related to our defined benefit pension plans and ENPP were $362.2 million as of December 31, 2019 compared to $356.7 million as of December 31, 2018. The increase in unrecognized net actuarial losses between years primarily resulted from lower discount rates at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018. The unrecognized net actuarial losses will be impacted in future periods by actual asset returns, discount rate changes, currency exchange rate fluctuations, actual demographic experience and certain other factors. For some of our defined benefit pension plans, these losses, to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater of the plan's liabilities or the fair value of assets ( the gain/loss corridor\u201d), will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods discussed as follows. For our U.S. salaried, U.S. hourly and U.K. defined benefit pension plans, the population covered is predominantly inactive participants, and losses related to those plans, to the extent they exceed the gain/loss corridor, will be amortized over the average remaining lives of those participants while covered by the respective plan. For our ENPP, the population is predominantly active participants, and losses related to the plan will be amortized over the average future working lifetime of the active participants expected to receive benefits. As of December 31, 2019, the average amortization periods were as follows: Table 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>ENPP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U.S. Plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U.K. Plan\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average amortization period of losses related to defined benefit pension plans\n</td> <td>7 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19 years\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnrecognized prior service cost related to our defined benefit pension plans was $22.5 million as of December 31, 2019 compared to $19.5 million as of December 31, 2018. The increase in the unrecognized prior service cost between years is due primarily to a plan amendment related to our ENPP.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our unfunded or underfunded obligations related to our defined benefit pension plans and ENPP were approximately $206.3 million, primarily related to our defined benefit pension plans in Europe and the United States. In 2019, we contributed approximately $30.6 million towards those obligations, and we expect to fund approximately $33.6 million in 2020. Future funding is dependent upon compliance with local laws and regulations and changes to those laws and regulations in the future, as well as the generation of operating cash flows in the future. We currently have an agreement in place with the trustees of the U.K. defined benefit plan that obligates us to fund approximately \u00a315.3 million per year (or approximately $20.2 million) towards that obligation through December 2021. The funding arrangement is based upon the current funded status and could change in the future as discount rates, local laws and regulations, and other factors change.\nSee Note 8 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d for more information regarding the investment strategy and concentration of risk.\nGoodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets\nWe test goodwill for impairment, at the reporting unit level, annually and when events or circumstances indicate that fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying value. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, for example, a component. We combine and aggregate two or more components of an operating segment as a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. Our reportable segments are not our reporting units.\nGoodwill is evaluated for impairment annually as of October 1 using a qualitative assessment or a quantitative one-step assessment. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value of our reporting units more likely than not exceeds their carrying value of net assets, no further evaluation is necessary. For reporting units where we perform a one-step quantitative assessment, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its respective carrying value of net assets, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value of net assets, the goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying value of net assets is higher than the fair value of the reporting unit, the impairment charge is the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's fair value.\nWe utilize a combination of valuation techniques, including a discounted cash flow approach and a market multiple approach, when making quantitative goodwill assessments.\nWe review our long-lived assets, which include intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation for recoverability is performed at a level where independent cash flows may be attributed to either an asset or asset group. If we determine that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group is not recoverable based on the expected undiscounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the excess of the carrying amounts over the estimated fair value of the long-lived assets. Estimates of future cash flows are based on many factors, including current operating results, expected market trends and competitive influences. We also evaluate the amortization periods assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether events or changes in circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives. Assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less estimated costs to sell.\nWe make various assumptions, including assumptions regarding future cash flows, market multiples, growth rates and discount rates, in our assessments of the impairment of goodwill, other indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets. The assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on the current and long-term business plans of the reporting unit or related to the long-lived assets. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the reporting unit or long-lived assets. These assumptions require significant judgments on our part, and the conclusions that we reach could vary significantly based upon these judgments.\nOur goodwill impairment analysis conducted as of October 1, 2019 indicated that the carrying value of the net assets of our grain storage and protein production systems business in Europe/Middle East was in excess of the fair value of the reporting unit, and therefore, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $173.6 million within Impairment charges\u201d in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. In response to weakening market conditions and resulting operating results, new management was put in place over the grain storage and protein productions systems business, tasked with conducting a full strategic review of the business, including that of the Europe/Middle East reporting unit. That full strategic review was completed in the fourth quarter of 2019, along with revised forecasts to include updated market conditions and strategic operating decisions. This impairment charge was a substantial portion of the reporting unit's goodwill balance as of October 1, 2019.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2019, we also recorded a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $3.0 million within Impairment charges\u201d in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The impairment charge related to certain long-lived intangible assets associated with our grain storage and protein production systems operations within North America due to the discontinuation of a certain brand name and related products and customers.\nFinally, our goodwill impairment analysis conducted as of October 1, 2019 also indicated that the fair value in excess of the carrying value of one of our smaller reporting units was less than 10%, due to deteriorating market conditions for the products it sells. If market conditions and our overall results do not improve, we may incur an impairment charge related to this reporting unit in the future under the one-step process described above. The goodwill associated with this reporting unit as of December 31, 2019 was approximately $20.0 million.\nThe results of our goodwill and long-lived assets impairment analyses conducted as of October 1, 2018 and 2017 indicated that no reduction in the carrying amount of goodwill and long-lived assets was required.\nNumerous facts and circumstances are considered when evaluating the carrying amount of our goodwill. The fair value of a reporting unit is impacted by the reporting unit's expected financial performance, which is dependent upon the agricultural industry and other factors that could adversely affect the agricultural industry, including but not limited to, declines in the general economy, increases in farm input costs, weather conditions, lower commodity prices and changes in the availability of credit. The estimated fair value of the individual reporting units is assessed for reasonableness by reviewing a variety of indicators evaluated over a reasonable period of time.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $1,298.3 million of goodwill, after the goodwill impairment charge we recorded during the three months ended December 31, 2019. While our annual impairment testing in 2019 supported the carrying amount of this goodwill, we may be required to re-evaluate the carrying amount in future periods, thus utilizing different assumptions that reflect the then current market conditions and expectations, and, therefore, we could conclude that an impairment has occurred.\nRecoverable Indirect Taxes\nOur Brazilian operations incur value added taxes ( VAT\u201d) on certain purchases of raw materials, components and services. These taxes are accumulated as tax credits and create assets that are reduced by the VAT collected from our sales in the Brazilian market. We regularly assesses the recoverability of these tax credits, and establishes reserves when necessary against them, through analyses that include, amongst others, the history of realization, the transfer of tax credits to third parties as authorized by the government, anticipated changes in the supply chain and the future expectation of tax debits from our ongoing operations. We believe that these tax credits, net of established reserves are realizable. Our assessment of realization of these tax assets involves significant judgments on our part, and the conclusions that we reach could vary significantly based upon these judgments. We recorded approximately $142.3 million and $156.0 million, respectively, of VAT tax credits, net of reserves, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.",

    "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWe are a leading manufacturer and distributor of agricultural equipment and related replacement parts throughout the world. We sell a full range of agricultural equipment, including tractors, combines, self-propelled sprayers, hay tools, forage equipment, seeding and tillage equipment, implements, and grain storage and protein production systems. Our products are widely recognized in the agricultural equipment industry and are marketed under a number of well-known brand names, including: Challenger\u00ae, Fendt\u00ae, GSI\u00ae, Massey Ferguson\u00ae and Valtra\u00ae. We distribute most of our products through a combination of approximately 3,275 dealers and distributors as well as associates and licensees. In addition, we provide retail financing through our finance joint ventures with Rabobank.\nFinancial Highlights\nWe sell our equipment and replacement parts to our independent dealers, distributors and other customers. A large majority of our sales are to independent dealers and distributors that sell our products to end users. To the extent practicable, we attempt to sell products to our dealers and distributors on a level basis throughout the year to reduce the effect of seasonal demands on our manufacturing operations and to minimize our investment in inventories. However, retail sales by dealers to farmers are highly seasonal and are linked to the planting and harvesting seasons. In certain markets, particularly in North America, there is often a time lag, which varies based on the timing and level of retail demand, between our sale of the equipment to the dealer and the dealer's sale to a retail customer.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage relationship to net sales of certain items included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations: \n___________________________________\n(1) Rounding may impact summation of amounts.\n2019 Compared to 2018\nNet income attributable to AGCO Corporation and subsidiaries for 2019 was $125.2 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, compared to $285.5 million, or $3.58 per diluted share for 2018.\nNet sales for 2019 were approximately $9,041.4 million, or 3.3% lower than 2018, primarily due to decreased sales volumes in our South American and Asia/Pacific/African ( APA\u201d) regions and the negative impact of currency translation. Income from operations was $348.1 million in 2019 compared to $489.0 million in 2018. The decrease in income from operations during 2019 was primarily the result of non-cash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges recorded during the fourth quarter of 2019 related to our grain storage and protein production systems operations in our Europe/Middle East ( EME\u201d) region. Excluding the impact of $176.6 million of non-cash impairment charges, income from operations during 2019 increased compared to 2018 due to improved gross profit margins, which largely offset the adverse impact of foreign currency translation.\nRegionally, income from operations in EME increased by approximately $37.1 million in 2019 compared to 2018, driven primarily by the benefit of higher sales and margin improvement resulting from the impacts of pricing, better factory productivity and a favorable sales mix. In our North American region, income from operations improved by approximately $18.5 million. Increased net sales levels and the benefit of favorable pricing impacts and expense control initiatives contributed to the improvement in the region. In South America, operating losses increased approximately $29.3 million in 2019 compared to 2018. The losses reflect low levels of industry demand and company production, as well as unfavorable cost impacts of newer product technology into our Brazilian factories. Income from operations in our APA region decreased approximately $6.2 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to lower net sales and production volumes.\nIndustry Market Conditions\nFarm economics remain challenged across the major crop-producing regions, and low commodity prices and international trade tensions continue to weigh on farmer sentiment, resulting in decreased global equipment demand during 2019. In North America, industry unit retail sales of utility and high horsepower tractors for 2019 decreased slightly compared to 2018. Industry unit retail sales of combines for 2019 decreased approximately 6% compared to 2018. A difficult growing season, as well as the uncertainty regarding the outcome of trade negotiations related to agricultural products and delayed market facilitation aid payments in the U.S., all contributed to weak demand in the large farm sector during 2019. In Western Europe, industry unit retail sales of tractors for 2019 declined approximately 2% compared to 2018. Industry unit retail sales of combines for 2019 decreased approximately 18% compared to 2018. Industry demand trended progressively lower throughout 2019 due to the impact of lower wheat and milk prices as well as higher input costs for dairy producers. During 2019, industry sales declines experienced in Italy, the United Kingdom and Germany were partially offset by industry sales growth in France and Finland. In South America, industry unit retail sales of tractors for 2019 dropped approximately 16% compared to 2018. Industry unit retail sales of combines for 2019 decreased approximately 5% compared to 2018. Despite improved grain production in Brazil and Argentina, industry demand was negatively impacted by interruptions in the government subsidized finance program in Brazil and weak economic conditions in Argentina.\nResults of Operations\nNet sales for 2019 were $9,041.4 million compared to $9,352.0 million for 2018, primarily as a result of sales declines in our South American and APA regions, partially offset by sales growth in our North American and EME regions, on a constant currency basis. The following table sets forth, for the year ended December 31, 2019, the impact to net sales of currency translation by geographical segment (in millions, except percentages): \nRegionally, net sales in North America increased during 2019 compared to 2018, with sales growth driven by a growth in net sales of low horsepower tractors, combines and parts, largely offset by a reduction in sales of protein production equipment and utility tractors. In the EME region, net sales, excluding the negative impact of foreign currency translation, increased during 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to net sales growth in France, Germany and Italy, partially offset by declines in the United Kingdom and Eastern Europe. Net sales decreased in South America in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to weaker industry conditions resulting in sales declines in Brazil and other South American markets as well as the negative impact of foreign currency translation. In the APA region, net sales decreased in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to lower sales in China, Southeast Asia and Africa. We estimate that worldwide average price increases were approximately 1.9% and 1.4% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Consolidated net sales of tractors and combines, which comprised approximately 61% of our net sales in 2019, decreased approximately 3.7% in 2019 compared to 2018. Unit sales of tractors and combines decreased approximately 9.5% during 2019 compared to 2018. The unit sales decrease and the decrease in net sales can differ due to foreign currency translation, pricing and sales mix changes.\nThe following table sets forth, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the percentage relationship to net sales of certain items included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations (in millions, except percentages): \n____________________________________\n(1) Rounding may impact summation of amounts.\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales increased during 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the benefit of pricing in excess of material cost increases, partially offset by the cost impact of lower production levels. Production hours decreased in both North America and South America, while production hours increased in Europe during 2019. Overall, production hours decreased approximately 2% on a global basis during 2019 compared to 2018. We recorded stock compensation expense of approximately $1.7 million and $2.3 million during 2019 and 2018, respectively, within cost of goods sold, as is more fully explained in Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nSelling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A expenses\u201d) and engineering expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were relatively flat during 2019 compared to 2018. We recorded stock compensation expense of approximately $40.0 million and $44.3 million during 2019 and 2018, respectively, within SG&A expenses, as is more fully explained in Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nWe recorded restructuring expenses of approximately $9.0 million and $12.0 million during 2019 and 2018, respectively. The restructuring expenses primarily related to severance and related costs associated with the rationalization of employee headcount at various manufacturing facilities and administrative offices located in Europe, South America, China, Africa and the United States during 2019, as well as the rationalization of our grain storage and protein production systems operations initiated in the fourth quarter of 2019. In addition, we recorded a loss of approximately $2.1 million within \"Restructuring expenses\" associated with the sale of our 50% interest in our USC, LLC joint venture. See Note 3 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d for additional information.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2019, we recorded non-cash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of approximately $173.6 million associated with our grain storage and protein production systems operations in Europe/Middle East, as well as the impairment of long-lived intangible assets of approximately $3.0 million associated with brand and product rationalization within our grain storage and protein production systems operations in North\nAmerica. These impairment charges are more fully described in Critical Accounting Estimates - Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets\u201d and Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nInterest expense, net was $19.9 million for 2019 compared to $53.8 million for 2018. The decline was primarily the result of debt extinguishment costs incurred in 2018 associated with debt refinancings completed during 2018 that included the replacement of higher interest-bearing debt with lower interest-bearing debt. During 2018, we repurchased approximately $300.0 million of our outstanding 57/8% senior notes. The repurchase resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $24.5 million, including associated fees, offset by approximately $4.7 million of accelerated amortization of a deferred gain related to a terminated interest rate swap instrument associated with the senior notes. In addition, we repaid our outstanding term loan under our former revolving credit and term loan facility. We recorded approximately $0.7 million associated with the write-off of deferred debt issuance costs and a loss of approximately $3.9 million from a terminated interest rate swap instrument related to the term loan.\nOther expense, net was $67.1 million in 2019 compared to $74.9 million in 2018. Losses on sales of receivables, primarily related to our accounts receivable sales agreements with our finance joint ventures in North America, Europe and Brazil, were approximately $42.4 million and $36.0 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Other expense, net for 2018 also included higher foreign exchanges losses, primarily associated with the significant devaluation of the Argentine peso.\nWe recorded an income tax provision of $180.8 million in 2019 compared to $110.9 million in 2018. Our tax provision and effective tax rate are impacted by the differing tax rates of the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, permanent differences for items treated differently for financial accounting and income tax purposes and for losses in jurisdictions where no income tax benefit is recorded. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had gross deferred tax assets of $396.0 million and $350.2 million, respectively, including $72.0 million and $74.5 million, respectively, related to net operating loss carryforwards. During 2019, we recognized a one-time income tax gain of approximately $21.8 million associated with the changing of Swiss federal and cantonal tax rates, as well as recognition of a deferred tax asset associated with the estimated value of a tax basis step-up of our Swiss subsidiary's assets. During 2019, we also recorded a non-cash adjustment to establish a valuation allowance against our Brazilian net deferred income tax assets of approximately $53.7 million. At December 31, 2019, we had total valuation allowances as an offset to our gross deferred tax assets of approximately $169.1 million. This valuation allowance included allowances primarily against net operating loss carryforwards in Brazil, China, Hungary, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, as well as allowances against our net deferred taxes primarily in the U.S. and Brazil. At December 31, 2018, we had total valuation allowances as an offset to the gross deferred tax assets of approximately $83.9 million, primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards in Brazil, China, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, as well as allowances against our net deferred taxes in the U.S. Realization of the net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2019 will depend on generating sufficient taxable income in future periods, net of reversing deferred tax liabilities. We believe it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized. Refer to Note 6 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d for further information.\nEquity in net earnings of affiliates, which is primarily comprised of income from our AGCO Finance joint ventures, was $42.5 million in 2019 compared to $34.3 million in 2018, primarily due to higher net earnings from our AGCO Finance joint ventures. See Finance Joint Ventures\u201d for further information regarding our finance joint ventures and their results of operations and Note 5 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d for further information.\n2018 Compared to 2017\nA comparison of the results of operations for 2018 versus that of 2017 was included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nQuarterly Results\nThe following table presents unaudited interim operating results. We believe that the following information includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly our results of operations for the periods presented. \nAGCO Finance Joint Ventures\nOur AGCO Finance joint ventures provide both retail financing and wholesale financing to our dealers in the United States, Canada, Europe, Brazil, Argentina and Australia. The joint ventures are owned by AGCO and by a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rabobank. The majority of the assets of the finance joint ventures consist of finance receivables. The majority of the liabilities consist of notes payable and accrued interest. Under the various joint venture agreements, Rabobank or its affiliates provide financing to the finance joint ventures, primarily through lines of credit. We do not guarantee the debt obligations of the joint ventures. As of December 31, 2019, our capital investment in the finance joint ventures, which is included in Investment in affiliates\u201d on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, was approximately $339.0 million compared to $358.7 million as of December 31, 2018. The total finance portfolio in our finance joint ventures was approximately $9.6 billion and $8.8 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The total finance portfolio as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 included approximately $7.7 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively, of retail receivables and $1.9 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, of wholesale receivables from AGCO dealers. The wholesale receivables either were sold directly to AGCO Finance without recourse from our operating companies or AGCO Finance provided the financing directly to the dealers. During 2019 and 2018, we did not make additional investments in our finance joint ventures. During 2019 and 2018, we received dividends of approximately $40.5 million and $29.4 million, respectively, from certain of our finance joint ventures. Our share in the earnings of the finance joint ventures, included in Equity in net earnings of affiliates\u201d within our Consolidated Statements of Operations, was $41.5 million and $34.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, with the increase in earnings primarily due to higher income in our European, Brazilian and U.S. finance joint ventures during 2019 as compared to 2018.\nOutlook\nOur operations are subject to the cyclical nature of the agricultural industry. Sales of our equipment are affected by, among other things, changes in net cash farm income, farm land values, weather conditions, the demand for agricultural commodities, commodity prices and general economic conditions.\nOur net sales are expected to increase in 2020 compared to 2019, resulting from relatively flat net sales volumes and positive pricing impacts. Gross and operating margins are expected to improve from 2019 levels, reflecting the positive impact of pricing and cost control initiatives. This assumes that the coronavirus outbreak does not significantly impact our business. See, Risk Factors.\u201d\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur financing requirements are subject to variations due to seasonal changes in inventory and receivable levels. Internally generated funds are supplemented when necessary from external sources, primarily our credit facility and accounts receivable sales agreement facilities. We believe that the following facilities, together with available cash and internally generated funds, will be sufficient to support our working capital, capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future (in millions): \n____________________________________\n(1) The amounts above are gross of debt issuance costs of an aggregate amount of approximately $2.3 million.\nInterest on U.S. dollar borrowings under our credit facility is calculated based upon LIBOR. In the event that LIBOR is no longer published, interest will be calculated based upon a base rate. The credit facility also provides for an expedited amendment process once a replacement for LIBOR is established.\nIn December 2018, we entered into a term loan agreement with the European Investment Bank ( EIB\u201d), which provided us with the ability to borrow up to \u20ac250.0 million. The \u20ac250.0 million (or approximately $280.2 million as of December 31, 2019) of funding was received on January 25, 2019 with a maturity date of January 24, 2025. We have the ability to prepay the term loan before its maturity date. Interest is payable on the term loan at 1.002% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears. We had an additional term loan with the EIB in the amount of \u20ac200.0 million that was entered into in December 2014 and had a maturity date of January 15, 2020. We repaid this \u20ac200.0 million (or approximately $220.0 million) term loan in December 2019.\nIn October 2018, we entered into a term loan agreement with Rabobank in the amount of \u20ac150.0 million (or approximately $168.1 million as of December 31, 2019). We have the ability to prepay the term loan before its maturity date on October 28, 2022. Interest is payable on the term loan quarterly in arrears at an annual rate, equal to the EURIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.875% to 1.875% based on our credit rating.\nIn October 2018, we entered into a multi-currency revolving credit facility of $800.0 million. The maturity date of the credit facility is October 17, 2023. Interest accrues on amounts outstanding under the credit facility, at our option, at either (1) LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.875% to 1.875% based on our credit rating, or (2) the base rate, which is equal to the higher of (i) the administrative agent's base lending rate for the applicable currency, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, and (iii) one-month LIBOR for loans denominated in U.S. dollars plus 1.0%, plus a margin ranging from 0.0% to 0.875% based on our credit rating.\nIn October 2016, we borrowed an aggregate amount of \u20ac375.0 million through a group of seven related term loan agreements. These agreements had maturities ranging from October 2019 to October 2026. In October 2019, we repaid an aggregate amount of \u20ac56.0 million (or approximately $61.1 million) of these term loans. In August 2018, we borrowed an additional aggregate amount of indebtedness of \u20ac338.0 million through a group of another seven related term loan agreements. Proceeds from the borrowings were used to repay borrowings under our former revolving credit facility. The provisions of the term loan agreements are identical in nature with the exception of interest rate terms and maturities. In aggregate, as of\nDecember 31, 2019, we have indebtedness of approximately \u20ac657.0 million (or approximately $736.2 million) under a total group of twelve term loan agreements with remaining maturities ranging from August 2021 to August 2028.\nWe are in compliance with the financial covenants contained in these facilities and expect to continue to maintain such compliance. Should we ever encounter difficulties, our historical relationship with our lenders has been strong and we anticipate their continued long-term support of our business. Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d for additional information regarding our current facilities, including the financial covenants contained in each debt instrument.\nOur accounts receivable sales agreements in North America, Europe and Brazil permit the sale, on an ongoing basis, of a majority of our receivables to our U.S., Canadian, European and Brazilian finance joint ventures. The sales of all receivables are without recourse to us. We do not service the receivables after the sales occur, and we do not maintain any direct retained interest in the receivables. These agreements are accounted for as off-balance sheet transactions and have the effect of reducing accounts receivable and short-term liabilities by the same amount. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the cash received from receivables sold under the U.S., Canadian, European and Brazilian accounts receivable sales agreements was approximately $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.\nOur finance joint ventures in Europe, Brazil and Australia also provide wholesale financing directly to our dealers. The receivables associated with these arrangements also are without recourse to us. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, these finance joint ventures had approximately $104.3 million and $82.5 million, respectively, of outstanding accounts receivable associated with these arrangements. These arrangements are accounted for as off-balance sheet transactions. In addition, we sell certain trade receivables under factoring arrangements to other financial institutions around the world. These arrangements also are accounted for as off-balance sheet transactions.\nOur debt to capitalization ratio, which is total indebtedness divided by the sum of total indebtedness and stockholders' equity, was 30.4% at December 31, 2019 compared to 32.8% at December 31, 2018.\nCash Flows\nCash flows provided by operating activities were $695.9 million during 2019 compared to $595.9 million during 2018 and $577.6 million during 2017. The increase during 2019 was primarily due to a source of cash in operating assets and liabilities in 2019 compared to a use of cash in 2018. In addition, we received an increased amount of dividends from our finance joint ventures in 2019 as compared to 2018.\nOur working capital requirements are seasonal, with investments in working capital typically building in the first half of the year and then reducing in the second half of the year. We had $844.6 million in working capital at December 31, 2019, as compared with $770.7 million at December 31, 2018. Accounts receivable and inventories, combined, at December 31, 2019 were $90.2 million higher than at December 31, 2018. Inventories as of December 31, 2019 included stock related to the transition of production to products meeting new emissions standards in Europe. Weaker market conditions in many key markets contributed to lower net sales and resulting higher finished goods inventories as compared to 2018.\nShare Repurchase Program\nDuring 2019 and 2018, we repurchased 1,794,256 and 3,120,184 shares of our common stock, respectively, for approximately $130.0 million and $184.3 million, respectively, either through Accelerated Share Repurchase ( ASR\u201d) agreements with financial institutions or through open market transactions. All shares received were retired upon receipt, and the excess of the purchase price over par value per share was recorded to a combination of Additional paid-in capital\u201d and \"Retained Earnings\" within our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIn February 2020, we entered into an ASR agreement with a financial institution to repurchase an aggregate of $25.0 million of shares of our common stock. We received approximately 297,000 shares to date in this transaction. Upon settlement of the ASR, we may be entitled to receive additional shares of common stock or, under certain circumstances, be required to remit a settlement amount. We expect that the additional shares will be received by us upon final settlement of our current ASR agreement, which expires during the second quarter of 2020.\nContractual Obligations\nThe future payments required under our significant contractual obligations, excluding foreign currency option and forward contracts, as of December 31, 2019 are as follows (in millions): \n_______________________________________\n (1) Indebtedness amounts reflect the principal amount of our senior term loan, senior notes and credit facility. \n (2) Estimated interest payments are calculated assuming current interest rates over minimum maturity periods specified in debt agreements. Debt may be repaid sooner or later than such minimum maturity periods. \n (3) Other short-term and long-term obligations include estimates of future minimum contribution requirements under our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension and postretirement plans. These estimates are based on current legislation in the countries we operate within and are subject to change. Other short-term and long-term obligations also include income tax liabilities related to uncertain income tax positions connected with ongoing income tax audits in various jurisdictions. \nCommitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nGuarantees\nWe maintain a remarketing agreement with our finance joint venture in the United States, whereby we are obligated to repurchase up to $6.0 million of repossessed equipment each calendar year. We believe any losses that might be incurred on the resale of this equipment will not materially impact our financial position or results of operations, due to the fact that the repurchase obligation would be equivalent to the fair value of the underlying equipment.\nAt December 31, 2019, we guaranteed indebtedness owed to third parties of approximately $47.6 million, primarily related to dealer and end-user financing of equipment. Such guarantees generally obligate us to repay outstanding finance obligations owed to financial institutions if dealers or end users default on such loans through 2025. Losses under such guarantees historically have been insignificant. In addition, we generally would expect to be able to recover a significant portion of the amounts paid under such guarantees from the sale of the underlying financed farm equipment, as the fair value of such equipment is expected to offset a substantial portion of the amounts paid. We also have obligations to guarantee indebtedness owed to certain of our finance joint ventures if dealers or end users default on loans. Losses under such guarantees historically have been insignificant and the guarantees are not material. We believe the credit risk associated with all of these guarantees is not material to our financial position or results of operations.\nIn addition, at December 31, 2019, we had accrued approximately $18.9 million of outstanding guarantees of minimum residual values that may be owed to our finance joint ventures in the United States and Canada due upon expiration of certain eligible operating leases between the finance joint ventures and end users. The maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantee is approximately $26.7 million.\nOther\nAt December 31, 2019, we had outstanding designated and non-designated foreign exchange contracts with a gross notional amount of approximately $3,133.0 million. The outstanding contracts as of December 31, 2019 range in maturity through December 2020.\nAs discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources,\u201d we sell a majority of our wholesale accounts receivable in North America, Europe and Brazil to our U.S., Canadian, European and Brazilian finance joint ventures. We also sell certain accounts receivable under factoring arrangements to financial institutions around the world. We have determined that these facilities should be accounted for as off-balance sheet transactions.\nContingencies\nWe are party to various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business. We closely monitor these claims and lawsuits and frequently consult with our legal counsel to determine whether they may, when resolved, have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations and accrue and/or disclose loss contingencies as appropriate. See Note 12 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d and Item 3, Legal Proceedings,\u201d for further information.\nRelated Parties\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company engages in transactions with related parties. See Note 14 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d for information regarding related party transactions and their impact to our consolidated results of operations and financial position.\nForeign Currency Risk Management\nWe have significant manufacturing locations in the United States, France, Germany, Finland, Italy, China and Brazil, and we purchase a portion of our tractors, combines and components from third-party foreign suppliers, primarily in various European countries and in Japan. We also sell products in approximately 140 countries throughout the world. The majority of our net sales outside the United States are denominated in the currency of the customer location, with the exception of sales in Middle East, Africa, Asia and parts of South America, where net sales are primarily denominated in British pounds, Euros, or the United States dollar.\nWe manage our transactional foreign currency exposure by hedging foreign currency cash flow forecasts and commitments arising from the anticipated settlement of receivables and payables and from future purchases and sales. Where naturally offsetting currency positions do not occur, we hedge certain, but not all, of our exposures through the use of foreign currency contracts. Our translation exposure resulting from translating the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries into United States dollars may be partially hedged from time to time. When practical, this translation impact is reduced by financing local operations with local borrowings. Our hedging policy prohibits use of foreign currency contracts for speculative trading purposes.\nThe total notional value of our foreign currency instruments was $3,133.0 million and $1,462.8 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, inclusive of both those instruments that are designated and qualified for hedge accounting and non-designated derivative instruments. We enter into cash flow hedges to minimize the variability in cash flows of assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and we enter into foreign currency contracts to economically hedge receivables and payables on our balance sheets that are denominated in foreign currencies other than the functional currency. In addition, we use derivative and non-derivative instruments to hedge a portion of our net investment in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. See Note 11 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d for further information about our hedging transactions and derivative instruments.\nAssuming a 10% change relative to the currency of the hedge contracts, the fair value of the foreign currency instruments could be negatively impacted by approximately $22.3 million as of December 31, 2019. Due to the fact that these instruments are primarily entered into for hedging purposes, the gains or losses on the contracts would largely be offset by losses and gains on the underlying firm commitment or forecasted transaction.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur interest expense is, in part, sensitive to the general level of interest rates. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through our mix of floating rate and fixed rate debt. From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. See Notes 7 and 11 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d for additional information about our interest rate swap agreements.\nBased on our floating rate debt and our accounts receivable sales facilities outstanding at December 31, 2019, a 10% increase in interest rates, would have increased, collectively, Interest expense, net\u201d and Other expense, net\u201d for the year ended December 31, 2019 by approximately $5.6 million.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their impact to our consolidated results of operations and financial position.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In the preparation of these financial statements, we make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the financial statements are detailed in Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d We believe that our application of the policies discussed below involves significant levels of judgment, estimates and complexity.\nDue to the levels of judgment, complexity and period of time over which many of these items are resolved, actual results could differ from those estimated at the time of preparation of the financial statements. Adjustments to these estimates would impact our financial position and future results of operations.\nDiscount and Sales Incentive Allowances\nWe provide various volume bonus and sales incentive programs with respect to our products. These sales incentive programs include reductions in invoice prices, reductions in retail financing rates, dealer commissions and dealer incentive allowances. In most cases, incentive programs are established and communicated to our dealers on a quarterly basis. The incentives are paid either at the time of the cash settlement of the receivable (which is generally at the time of retail sale), at the time of retail financing, at the time of warranty registration, or at a subsequent time based on dealer purchase volumes. The incentive programs are product line specific and generally do not vary by dealer. The cost of sales incentives associated with dealer commissions and dealer incentive allowances is estimated based upon the terms of the programs and historical experience, is based on a percentage of the sales price, and estimates for sales incentives are made and recorded at the time of sale for expected incentive programs using the expected value method. These estimates are reassessed each reporting period and are revised in the event of subsequent modifications to incentive programs, as they are communicated to dealers. The related provisions and accruals are made on a product or product-line basis and are monitored for adequacy and revised at least quarterly in the event of subsequent modifications to the programs. Interest rate subsidy payments, which are a reduction in retail financing rates, are recorded in the same manner as dealer commissions and dealer incentive allowances. Volume discounts are estimated and recognized based on historical experience, and related reserves are monitored and adjusted based on actual dealer purchase volumes and the dealers' progress towards achieving specified cumulative target levels. Estimates of these incentives are based on the terms of the programs and historical experience. All incentive programs are recorded and presented as a reduction of revenue, due to the fact that we do not receive a distinct good or service in exchange for the consideration provided. In the United States and Canada, reserves for incentive programs related to accounts receivable not sold to our U.S. and Canadian finance joint ventures are recorded as accounts receivable allowances\u201d within our Consolidated Balance Sheets due to the fact that the incentives are paid through a reduction of future cash settlement of the receivable. Globally, reserves for incentive programs that will be paid in cash or credit memos, as is the case with most of our volume discount programs, as well as sales incentives associated with accounts receivable sold to our finance joint ventures, are recorded within Accrued expenses\u201d within our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had recorded an allowance for discounts and sales incentives of approximately $606.1 million that will be paid either through a reduction of future cash settlements of receivables and through credit memos\nto our dealers or through reductions in retail financing rates paid to our finance joint ventures. If we were to allow an additional 1% of sales incentives and discounts at the time of retail sale for those sales subject to such discount programs, our reserve would increase by approximately $21.0 million as of December 31, 2019. Conversely, if we were to decrease our sales incentives and discounts by 1% at the time of retail sale, our reserve would decrease by approximately $21.0 million as of December 31, 2019.\nDeferred Income Taxes and Uncertain Income Tax Positions\nWe recorded an income tax provision of $180.8 million in 2019 compared to $110.9 million in 2018 and $133.6 million in 2017. Our tax provision and effective tax rate are impacted by the differing tax rates of the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, permanent differences for items treated differently for financial accounting and income tax purposes, and for losses in jurisdictions where no income tax benefit is recorded.\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, we recorded a non-cash adjustment to establish a valuation allowance against our Brazilian net deferred income tax assets of approximately $53.7 million. In addition, we maintain a valuation allowance to fully reserve against our net deferred tax assets in the United States and certain other foreign jurisdictions. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We assessed the likelihood that our deferred tax assets would be recovered from estimated future taxable income and available tax planning strategies and determined that the adjustment to the valuation allowance was appropriate. In making this assessment, all available evidence was considered including the current economic climate, as well as reasonable tax planning strategies. We believe it is more likely than not that we will realize our remaining net deferred tax assets, net of the valuation allowance, in future years.\nSwiss tax reform was enacted during 2019 and eliminates certain preferential tax items as well as implements new tax rates at both the federal and cantonal levels. During the three months ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized a one-time income tax gain of approximately $21.8 million associated with the changing of Swiss federal and cantonal tax rates as well as recognition of a deferred tax asset associated with the estimated value of a tax basis step-up of our Swiss subsidiary's assets.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( the 2017 Tax Act\u201d) was enacted in the United States. During the three months ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a tax provision of approximately $42.0 million in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which provided SEC Staff guidance for the application of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 740 Income Taxes,\u201d in the reporting period in which the 2017 Tax Act was enacted. The $42.0 million tax provision included a provisional income tax charge related to a one-time transition tax associated with the mandatory deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. The tax provision also included a provisional income tax charge associated with the income tax consequences related to the expected future repatriation of certain underlying foreign earnings, as historically, we have considered them to be permanently reinvested. The remaining balance of the tax provision primarily related to the remeasurement of certain net deferred tax assets using the lower enacted U.S. Corporate tax rate (from 35% to 21%), as well as other miscellaneous related impacts. During the three months ended December 31, 2018, we finalized our calculations related to the 2017 Tax Act and recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $8.4 million.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had gross deferred tax assets of $396.0 million and $350.2 million, respectively, including $72.0 million and $74.5 million, respectively, related to net operating loss carryforwards. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had total valuation allowances as an offset to our gross deferred tax assets of $169.1 million and $83.9 million, respectively, which included allowances primarily against net operating loss carryforwards in Brazil, China, Hungary, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, as well as allowances against our net deferred taxes primarily in the U.S. and Brazil, as previously discussed. Realization of the remaining deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2019 will depend on generating sufficient taxable income in future periods, net of reversing deferred tax liabilities. We believe it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized.\nWe recognize income tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only when there is a more than 50% likelihood that the tax positions will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the positions. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had approximately $210.7 million and $166.1 million, respectively, of gross unrecognized tax benefits, all of which would impact our effective tax rate if recognized. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had approximately $51.0 million and $58.5 million, respectively, of current accrued taxes related to uncertain income tax positions connected with ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions that we expect to settle or pay in the next 12 months. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $28.4 million and $27.2 million, respectively. See Note 6 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our uncertain income tax positions.\nPensions\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees, principally in the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, Switzerland, Finland, France, Norway and Argentina. Our primary plans cover certain employees in the United States and the United Kingdom.\nIn the United States, we sponsor a funded, qualified defined benefit pension plan for our salaried employees, as well as a separate funded qualified defined benefit pension plan for our hourly employees. Both plans are closed to new entrants and frozen, and we fund at least the minimum contributions required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code to both plans. In addition, we maintain an unfunded, nonqualified defined benefit pension plan for certain senior executives, which is our Executive Nonqualified Pension Plan ( ENPP\u201d). The ENPP is also closed to new entrants.\nIn the United Kingdom, we sponsor a funded defined benefit pension plan that provides an annuity benefit based on participants' final average earnings and service. Participation in this plan is limited to certain older, longer service employees and existing retirees. This plan is closed to new participants.\nSee Note 8 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d for additional information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits.\nNature of Estimates Required. The measurement date for all of our benefit plans is December 31. The measurement of our pension obligations, costs and liabilities is dependent on a variety of assumptions provided by management and used by our actuaries. These assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience. These assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions.\nAssumptions and Approach Used. The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include, but are not limited to, the following key factors: \nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we used a globally consistent methodology to set the discount rate in the countries where our largest benefit obligations exist. In the United States, the United Kingdom and the Euro Zone, we constructed a hypothetical bond portfolio of high-quality corporate bonds and then applied the cash flows of our benefit plans to those bond yields to derive a discount rate. The bond portfolio and plan-specific cash flows vary by country, but the methodology in which the portfolio is constructed is consistent. In the United States, the bond portfolio is large enough to result in taking a settlement approach\u201d to derive the discount rate, in which high-quality corporate bonds are assumed to be purchased and the resulting coupon payments and maturities are used to satisfy our U.S. pension plans' projected benefit payments. In the United Kingdom and the Euro Zone, the discount rate is derived using a yield curve approach,\u201d in which an individual spot rate, or zero coupon bond yield, for each future annual period is developed to discount each future benefit payment and, thereby, determine the present value of all future payments. The Company uses a spot yield curve to determine the discount rate applicable in the United Kingdom to measure the U.K. pension plan's service cost and interest cost. Under the settlement and yield curve approaches, the discount rate is set to equal the single discount rate that produces the same present value of all future payments.\nThe other key assumptions and methods were set as follows:\n \u2022 Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. \n \u2022 The salary growth assumptions reflect our long-term actual experience, the near-term outlook and assumed inflation. \n \u2022 The expected return on plan asset assumptions reflects asset allocations, investment strategy, historical experience and the views of investment managers, and reflects a projection of the expected arithmetic returns over ten years. \n \u2022 Determination of retirement rates and ages as well as termination rates, based on actual plan experience, actuarial standards of practice and the manner in which our defined benefit plans are being administered. \n \u2022 The mortality rates for the U.K. defined benefit pension plan was updated in 2019 to reflect the latest expected improvements in the life expectancy of the plan participants. The mortality rates for the U.S. defined benefit pension plans were updated in 2019 to reflect the Society of Actuaries' most recent findings on the topic of mortality. \n \u2022 The fair value of assets used to determine the expected return on assets does not reflect any delayed recognition of asset gains and losses. \nThe effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such periods.\nOur U.S. and U.K. defined benefit pension plans, including our ENPP, comprised approximately 86% of our consolidated projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2019. If the discount rate used to determine the 2019 projected benefit obligation for our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans and our ENPP was decreased by 25 basis points, our projected benefit obligation would have increased by approximately $4.8 million at December 31, 2019, and our 2020 pension expense would increase by approximately $0.5 million. If the discount rate used to determine the 2019 projected benefit obligation for our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans and our ENPP was increased by 25 basis points, our projected benefit obligation would have decreased by approximately $4.5 million at December 31, 2019, and our 2020 pension expense would decrease by approximately $0.5 million. If the discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for our U.K. defined benefit pension plan was decreased by 25 basis points, our projected benefit obligation would have increased by approximately $25.3 million at December 31, 2019, and our 2020 pension expense would increase by approximately $0.2 million. If the discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for our U.K. defined benefit pension plan was increased by 25 basis points, our projected benefit obligation would have decreased by approximately $23.1 million at December 31, 2019, and our 2020 pension expense would decrease by approximately $0.3 million. In addition, if the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets related to our U.K. defined benefit pension plan was increased or decreased by 25 basis points, our 2020 pension expense would decrease or increase by approximately $1.6 million each, respectively. The impact to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans for a 25-basis-point change in our expected long-term rate of return would decrease or increase our 2020 pension expense by approximately $0.1 million, respectively.\nUnrecognized actuarial net losses related to our defined benefit pension plans and ENPP were $362.2 million as of December 31, 2019 compared to $356.7 million as of December 31, 2018. The increase in unrecognized net actuarial losses between years primarily resulted from lower discount rates at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018. The unrecognized net actuarial losses will be impacted in future periods by actual asset returns, discount rate changes, currency exchange rate fluctuations, actual demographic experience and certain other factors. For some of our defined benefit pension plans, these losses, to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater of the plan's liabilities or the fair value of assets ( the gain/loss corridor\u201d), will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods discussed as follows. For our U.S. salaried, U.S. hourly and U.K. defined benefit pension plans, the population covered is predominantly inactive participants, and losses related to those plans, to the extent they exceed the gain/loss corridor, will be amortized over the average remaining lives of those participants while covered by the respective plan. For our ENPP, the population is predominantly active participants, and losses related to the plan will be amortized over the average future working lifetime of the active participants expected to receive benefits. As of December 31, 2019, the average amortization periods were as follows: \nUnrecognized prior service cost related to our defined benefit pension plans was $22.5 million as of December 31, 2019 compared to $19.5 million as of December 31, 2018. The increase in the unrecognized prior service cost between years is due primarily to a plan amendment related to our ENPP.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our unfunded or underfunded obligations related to our defined benefit pension plans and ENPP were approximately $206.3 million, primarily related to our defined benefit pension plans in Europe and the United States. In 2019, we contributed approximately $30.6 million towards those obligations, and we expect to fund approximately $33.6 million in 2020. Future funding is dependent upon compliance with local laws and regulations and changes to those laws and regulations in the future, as well as the generation of operating cash flows in the future. We currently have an agreement in place with the trustees of the U.K. defined benefit plan that obligates us to fund approximately \u00a315.3 million per year (or approximately $20.2 million) towards that obligation through December 2021. The funding arrangement is based upon the current funded status and could change in the future as discount rates, local laws and regulations, and other factors change.\nSee Note 8 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d for more information regarding the investment strategy and concentration of risk.\nGoodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets\nWe test goodwill for impairment, at the reporting unit level, annually and when events or circumstances indicate that fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying value. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, for example, a component. We combine and aggregate two or more components of an operating segment as a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. Our reportable segments are not our reporting units.\nGoodwill is evaluated for impairment annually as of October 1 using a qualitative assessment or a quantitative one-step assessment. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value of our reporting units more likely than not exceeds their carrying value of net assets, no further evaluation is necessary. For reporting units where we perform a one-step quantitative assessment, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its respective carrying value of net assets, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value of net assets, the goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying value of net assets is higher than the fair value of the reporting unit, the impairment charge is the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's fair value.\nWe utilize a combination of valuation techniques, including a discounted cash flow approach and a market multiple approach, when making quantitative goodwill assessments.\nWe review our long-lived assets, which include intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation for recoverability is performed at a level where independent cash flows may be attributed to either an asset or asset group. If we determine that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group is not recoverable based on the",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWe are a leading manufacturer and distributor of agricultural equipment and related replacement parts throughout the world. We sell a full range of agricultural equipment, including tractors, combines, self-propelled sprayers, hay tools, forage equipment, seeding and tillage equipment, implements, and grain storage and protein production systems. Our products are widely recognized in the agricultural equipment industry and are marketed under a number of well-known brand names, including: Challenger\u00ae, Fendt\u00ae, GSI\u00ae, Massey Ferguson\u00ae and Valtra\u00ae. We distribute most of our products through a combination of approximately 3,275 dealers and distributors as well as associates and licensees. In addition, we provide retail financing through our finance joint ventures with Rabobank.\nFinancial Highlights\nWe sell our equipment and replacement parts to our independent dealers, distributors and other customers. A large majority of our sales are to independent dealers and distributors that sell our products to end users. To the extent practicable, we attempt to sell products to our dealers and distributors on a level basis throughout the year to reduce the effect of seasonal demands on our manufacturing operations and to minimize our investment in inventories. However, retail sales by dealers to farmers are highly seasonal and are linked to the planting and harvesting seasons. In certain markets, particularly in North America, there is often a time lag, which varies based on the timing and level of retail demand, between our sale of the equipment to the dealer and the dealer's sale to a retail customer.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage relationship to net sales of certain items included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations: Table 41: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>78.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>21.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Engineering expenses\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment charges\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangibles\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring expenses\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bad debt expense\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from operations\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense, net\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes and equity in net earnings of affiliates\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax provision\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before equity in net earnings of affiliates\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in net earnings of affiliates\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to AGCO Corporation and subsidiaries\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________________________________\n(1) Rounding may impact summation of amounts.\n2019 Compared to 2018\nNet income attributable to AGCO Corporation and subsidiaries for 2019 was $125.2 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, compared to $285.5 million, or $3.58 per diluted share for 2018.\nNet sales for 2019 were approximately $9,041.4 million, or 3.3% lower than 2018, primarily due to decreased sales volumes in our South American and Asia/Pacific/African ( APA\u201d) regions and the negative impact of currency translation. Income from operations was $348.1 million in 2019 compared to $489.0 million in 2018. The decrease in income from operations during 2019 was primarily the result of non-cash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges recorded during the fourth quarter of 2019 related to our grain storage and protein production systems operations in our Europe/Middle East ( EME\u201d) region. Excluding the impact of $176.6 million of non-cash impairment charges, income from operations during 2019 increased compared to 2018 due to improved gross profit margins, which largely offset the adverse impact of foreign currency translation.\nRegionally, income from operations in EME increased by approximately $37.1 million in 2019 compared to 2018, driven primarily by the benefit of higher sales and margin improvement resulting from the impacts of pricing, better factory productivity and a favorable sales mix. In our North American region, income from operations improved by approximately $18.5 million. Increased net sales levels and the benefit of favorable pricing impacts and expense control initiatives contributed to the improvement in the region. In South America, operating losses increased approximately $29.3 million in 2019 compared to 2018. The losses reflect low levels of industry demand and company production, as well as unfavorable cost impacts of newer product technology into our Brazilian factories. Income from operations in our APA region decreased approximately $6.2 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to lower net sales and production volumes.\nIndustry Market Conditions\nFarm economics remain challenged across the major crop-producing regions, and low commodity prices and international trade tensions continue to weigh on farmer sentiment, resulting in decreased global equipment demand during 2019. In North America, industry unit retail sales of utility and high horsepower tractors for 2019 decreased slightly compared to 2018. Industry unit retail sales of combines for 2019 decreased approximately 6% compared to 2018. A difficult growing season, as well as the uncertainty regarding the outcome of trade negotiations related to agricultural products and delayed market facilitation aid payments in the U.S., all contributed to weak demand in the large farm sector during 2019. In Western Europe, industry unit retail sales of tractors for 2019 declined approximately 2% compared to 2018. Industry unit retail sales of combines for 2019 decreased approximately 18% compared to 2018. Industry demand trended progressively lower throughout 2019 due to the impact of lower wheat and milk prices as well as higher input costs for dairy producers. During 2019, industry sales declines experienced in Italy, the United Kingdom and Germany were partially offset by industry sales growth in France and Finland. In South America, industry unit retail sales of tractors for 2019 dropped approximately 16% compared to 2018. Industry unit retail sales of combines for 2019 decreased approximately 5% compared to 2018. Despite improved grain production in Brazil and Argentina, industry demand was negatively impacted by interruptions in the government subsidized finance program in Brazil and weak economic conditions in Argentina.\nResults of Operations\nNet sales for 2019 were $9,041.4 million compared to $9,352.0 million for 2018, primarily as a result of sales declines in our South American and APA regions, partially offset by sales growth in our North American and EME regions, on a constant currency basis.

In the EME region, net sales, excluding the negative impact of foreign currency translation, increased during 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to net sales growth in France, Germany and Italy, partially offset by declines in the United Kingdom and Eastern Europe. Net sales decreased in South America in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to weaker industry conditions resulting in sales declines in Brazil and other South American markets as well as the negative impact of foreign currency translation. In the APA region, net sales decreased in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to lower sales in China, Southeast Asia and Africa. We estimate that worldwide average price increases were approximately 1.9% and 1.4% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Consolidated net sales of tractors and combines, which comprised approximately 61% of our net sales in 2019, decreased approximately 3.7% in 2019 compared to 2018. Unit sales of tractors and combines decreased approximately 9.5% during 2019 compared to 2018. The unit sales decrease and the decrease in net sales can differ due to foreign currency translation, pricing and sales mix changes.\nThe following table sets forth, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the percentage relationship to net sales of certain items included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations (in millions, except percentages): Table 43: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nNet Sales(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nNet Sales\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,984.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,996.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>1,040.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,069.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Engineering expenses\n</td> <td>343.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>355.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment charges\n</td> <td>176.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangibles\n</td> <td>61.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring expenses\n</td> <td>9.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bad debt expense\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>348.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>489.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________________________\n(1) Rounding may impact summation of amounts.\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales increased during 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the benefit of pricing in excess of material cost increases, partially offset by the cost impact of lower production levels. Production hours decreased in both North America and South America, while production hours increased in Europe during 2019. Overall, production hours decreased approximately 2% on a global basis during 2019 compared to 2018. We recorded stock compensation expense of approximately $1.7 million and $2.3 million during 2019 and 2018, respectively, within cost of goods sold, as is more fully explained in Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nSelling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A expenses\u201d) and engineering expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were relatively flat during 2019 compared to 2018. We recorded stock compensation expense of approximately $40.0 million and $44.3 million during 2019 and 2018, respectively, within SG&A expenses, as is more fully explained in Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nWe recorded restructuring expenses of approximately $9.0 million and $12.0 million during 2019 and 2018, respectively. The restructuring expenses primarily related to severance and related costs associated with the rationalization of employee headcount at various manufacturing facilities and administrative offices located in Europe, South America, China, Africa and the United States during 2019, as well as the rationalization of our grain storage and protein production systems operations initiated in the fourth quarter of 2019. In addition, we recorded a loss of approximately $2.1 million within \"Restructuring expenses\" associated with the sale of our 50% interest in our USC, LLC joint venture. See Note 3 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d for additional information.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2019, we recorded non-cash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of approximately $173.6 million associated with our grain storage and protein production systems operations in Europe/Middle East, as well as the impairment of long-lived intangible assets of approximately $3.0 million associated with brand and product rationalization within our grain storage and protein production systems operations in North\nAmerica. These impairment charges are more fully described in Critical Accounting Estimates - Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets\u201d and Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nInterest expense, net was $19.9 million for 2019 compared to $53.8 million for 2018. The decline was primarily the result of debt extinguishment costs incurred in 2018 associated with debt refinancings completed during 2018 that included the replacement of higher interest-bearing debt with lower interest-bearing debt. During 2018, we repurchased approximately $300.0 million of our outstanding 57/8% senior notes. The repurchase resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $24.5 million, including associated fees, offset by approximately $4.7 million of accelerated amortization of a deferred gain related to a terminated interest rate swap instrument associated with the senior notes. In addition, we repaid our outstanding term loan under our former revolving credit and term loan facility. We recorded approximately $0.7 million associated with the write-off of deferred debt issuance costs and a loss of approximately $3.9 million from a terminated interest rate swap instrument related to the term loan.\nOther expense, net was $67.1 million in 2019 compared to $74.9 million in 2018. Losses on sales of receivables, primarily related to our accounts receivable sales agreements with our finance joint ventures in North America, Europe and Brazil, were approximately $42.4 million and $36.0 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Other expense, net for 2018 also included higher foreign exchanges losses, primarily associated with the significant devaluation of the Argentine peso.\nWe recorded an income tax provision of $180.8 million in 2019 compared to $110.9 million in 2018. Our tax provision and effective tax rate are impacted by the differing tax rates of the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, permanent differences for items treated differently for financial accounting and income tax purposes and for losses in jurisdictions where no income tax benefit is recorded. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had gross deferred tax assets of $396.0 million and $350.2 million, respectively, including $72.0 million and $74.5 million, respectively, related to net operating loss carryforwards. During 2019, we recognized a one-time income tax gain of approximately $21.8 million associated with the changing of Swiss federal and cantonal tax rates, as well as recognition of a deferred tax asset associated with the estimated value of a tax basis step-up of our Swiss subsidiary's assets. During 2019, we also recorded a non-cash adjustment to establish a valuation allowance against our Brazilian net deferred income tax assets of approximately $53.7 million. At December 31, 2019, we had total valuation allowances as an offset to our gross deferred tax assets of approximately $169.1 million. This valuation allowance included allowances primarily against net operating loss carryforwards in Brazil, China, Hungary, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, as well as allowances against our net deferred taxes primarily in the U.S. and Brazil. At December 31, 2018, we had total valuation allowances as an offset to the gross deferred tax assets of approximately $83.9 million, primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards in Brazil, China, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, as well as allowances against our net deferred taxes in the U.S. Realization of the net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2019 will depend on generating sufficient taxable income in future periods, net of reversing deferred tax liabilities. We believe it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized. Refer to Note 6 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d for further information.\nEquity in net earnings of affiliates, which is primarily comprised of income from our AGCO Finance joint ventures, was $42.5 million in 2019 compared to $34.3 million in 2018, primarily due to higher net earnings from our AGCO Finance joint ventures. See Finance Joint Ventures\u201d for further information regarding our finance joint ventures and their results of operations and Note 5 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d for further information.\n2018 Compared to 2017\nA comparison of the results of operations for 2018 versus that of 2017 was included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nQuarterly Results\nThe following table presents unaudited interim operating results.

The joint ventures are owned by AGCO and by a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rabobank. The majority of the assets of the finance joint ventures consist of finance receivables. The majority of the liabilities consist of notes payable and accrued interest. Under the various joint venture agreements, Rabobank or its affiliates provide financing to the finance joint ventures, primarily through lines of credit. We do not guarantee the debt obligations of the joint ventures. As of December 31, 2019, our capital investment in the finance joint ventures, which is included in Investment in affiliates\u201d on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, was approximately $339.0 million compared to $358.7 million as of December 31, 2018. The total finance portfolio in our finance joint ventures was approximately $9.6 billion and $8.8 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The total finance portfolio as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 included approximately $7.7 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively, of retail receivables and $1.9 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, of wholesale receivables from AGCO dealers. The wholesale receivables either were sold directly to AGCO Finance without recourse from our operating companies or AGCO Finance provided the financing directly to the dealers. During 2019 and 2018, we did not make additional investments in our finance joint ventures. During 2019 and 2018, we received dividends of approximately $40.5 million and $29.4 million, respectively, from certain of our finance joint ventures. Our share in the earnings of the finance joint ventures, included in Equity in net earnings of affiliates\u201d within our Consolidated Statements of Operations, was $41.5 million and $34.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, with the increase in earnings primarily due to higher income in our European, Brazilian and U.S. finance joint ventures during 2019 as compared to 2018.\nOutlook\nOur operations are subject to the cyclical nature of the agricultural industry. Sales of our equipment are affected by, among other things, changes in net cash farm income, farm land values, weather conditions, the demand for agricultural commodities, commodity prices and general economic conditions.\nOur net sales are expected to increase in 2020 compared to 2019, resulting from relatively flat net sales volumes and positive pricing impacts. Gross and operating margins are expected to improve from 2019 levels, reflecting the positive impact of pricing and cost control initiatives. This assumes that the coronavirus outbreak does not significantly impact our business. See, Risk Factors.\u201d\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur financing requirements are subject to variations due to seasonal changes in inventory and receivable levels. Internally generated funds are supplemented when necessary from external sources, primarily our credit facility and accounts receivable sales agreement facilities. We believe that the following facilities, together with available cash and internally generated funds, will be sufficient to support our working capital, capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future (in millions): Table 45: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1.002% Senior term loan due 2025(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>280.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior term loan due 2022(1)\n</td> <td>168.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit facility, expires 2023\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior term loans due between 2021 and 2028(1)\n</td> <td>736.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term debt\n</td> <td>12.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________________________\n(1) The amounts above are gross of debt issuance costs of an aggregate amount of approximately $2.3 million.\nInterest on U.S. dollar borrowings under our credit facility is calculated based upon LIBOR. In the event that LIBOR is no longer published, interest will be calculated based upon a base rate. The credit facility also provides for an expedited amendment process once a replacement for LIBOR is established.\nIn December 2018, we entered into a term loan agreement with the European Investment Bank ( EIB\u201d), which provided us with the ability to borrow up to \u20ac250.0 million. The \u20ac250.0 million (or approximately $280.2 million as of December 31, 2019) of funding was received on January 25, 2019 with a maturity date of January 24, 2025. We have the ability to prepay the term loan before its maturity date. Interest is payable on the term loan at 1.002% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears. We had an additional term loan with the EIB in the amount of \u20ac200.0 million that was entered into in December 2014 and had a maturity date of January 15, 2020. We repaid this \u20ac200.0 million (or approximately $220.0 million) term loan in December 2019.\nIn October 2018, we entered into a term loan agreement with Rabobank in the amount of \u20ac150.0 million (or approximately $168.1 million as of December 31, 2019). We have the ability to prepay the term loan before its maturity date on October 28, 2022. Interest is payable on the term loan quarterly in arrears at an annual rate, equal to the EURIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.875% to 1.875% based on our credit rating.\nIn October 2018, we entered into a multi-currency revolving credit facility of $800.0 million. The maturity date of the credit facility is October 17, 2023. Interest accrues on amounts outstanding under the credit facility, at our option, at either (1) LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.875% to 1.875% based on our credit rating, or (2) the base rate, which is equal to the higher of (i) the administrative agent's base lending rate for the applicable currency, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, and (iii) one-month LIBOR for loans denominated in U.S. dollars plus 1.0%, plus a margin ranging from 0.0% to 0.875% based on our credit rating.\nIn October 2016, we borrowed an aggregate amount of \u20ac375.0 million through a group of seven related term loan agreements. These agreements had maturities ranging from October 2019 to October 2026. In October 2019, we repaid an aggregate amount of \u20ac56.0 million (or approximately $61.1 million) of these term loans. In August 2018, we borrowed an additional aggregate amount of indebtedness of \u20ac338.0 million through a group of another seven related term loan agreements. Proceeds from the borrowings were used to repay borrowings under our former revolving credit facility. The provisions of the term loan agreements are identical in nature with the exception of interest rate terms and maturities. In aggregate, as of\nDecember 31, 2019, we have indebtedness of approximately \u20ac657.0 million (or approximately $736.2 million) under a total group of twelve term loan agreements with remaining maturities ranging from August 2021 to August 2028.\nWe are in compliance with the financial covenants contained in these facilities and expect to continue to maintain such compliance. Should we ever encounter difficulties, our historical relationship with our lenders has been strong and we anticipate their continued long-term support of our business. Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d for additional information regarding our current facilities, including the financial covenants contained in each debt instrument.\nOur accounts receivable sales agreements in North America, Europe and Brazil permit the sale, on an ongoing basis, of a majority of our receivables to our U.S., Canadian, European and Brazilian finance joint ventures. The sales of all receivables are without recourse to us. We do not service the receivables after the sales occur, and we do not maintain any direct retained interest in the receivables. These agreements are accounted for as off-balance sheet transactions and have the effect of reducing accounts receivable and short-term liabilities by the same amount. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the cash received from receivables sold under the U.S., Canadian, European and Brazilian accounts receivable sales agreements was approximately $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.\nOur finance joint ventures in Europe, Brazil and Australia also provide wholesale financing directly to our dealers. The receivables associated with these arrangements also are without recourse to us. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, these finance joint ventures had approximately $104.3 million and $82.5 million, respectively, of outstanding accounts receivable associated with these arrangements. These arrangements are accounted for as off-balance sheet transactions. In addition, we sell certain trade receivables under factoring arrangements to other financial institutions around the world. These arrangements also are accounted for as off-balance sheet transactions.\nOur debt to capitalization ratio, which is total indebtedness divided by the sum of total indebtedness and stockholders' equity, was 30.4% at December 31, 2019 compared to 32.8% at December 31, 2018.\nCash Flows\nCash flows provided by operating activities were $695.9 million during 2019 compared to $595.9 million during 2018 and $577.6 million during 2017. The increase during 2019 was primarily due to a source of cash in operating assets and liabilities in 2019 compared to a use of cash in 2018. In addition, we received an increased amount of dividends from our finance joint ventures in 2019 as compared to 2018.\nOur working capital requirements are seasonal, with investments in working capital typically building in the first half of the year and then reducing in the second half of the year. We had $844.6 million in working capital at December 31, 2019, as compared with $770.7 million at December 31, 2018. Accounts receivable and inventories, combined, at December 31, 2019 were $90.2 million higher than at December 31, 2018. Inventories as of December 31, 2019 included stock related to the transition of production to products meeting new emissions standards in Europe. Weaker market conditions in many key markets contributed to lower net sales and resulting higher finished goods inventories as compared to 2018.\nShare Repurchase Program\nDuring 2019 and 2018, we repurchased 1,794,256 and 3,120,184 shares of our common stock, respectively, for approximately $130.0 million and $184.3 million, respectively, either through Accelerated Share Repurchase ( ASR\u201d) agreements with financial institutions or through open market transactions. All shares received were retired upon receipt, and the excess of the purchase price over par value per share was recorded to a combination of Additional paid-in capital\u201d and \"Retained Earnings\" within our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIn February 2020, we entered into an ASR agreement with a financial institution to repurchase an aggregate of $25.0 million of shares of our common stock. We received approximately 297,000 shares to date in this transaction. Upon settlement of the ASR, we may be entitled to receive additional shares of common stock or, under certain circumstances, be required to remit a settlement amount. We expect that the additional shares will be received by us upon final settlement of our current ASR agreement, which expires during the second quarter of 2020.\nContractual Obligations\nThe future payments required under our significant contractual obligations, excluding foreign currency option and forward contracts, as of December 31, 2019 are as follows (in millions): Table 46: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due By Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021 to 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2023 to 2024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2025 and Beyond\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Indebtedness(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,270.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>468.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>280.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>445.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments related to indebtedness(2)\n</td> <td>57.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>18.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>223.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unconditional purchase obligations\n</td> <td>127.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other short-term and long-term obligations(3)\n</td> <td>296.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,993.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>337.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>699.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>388.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>568.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021 to 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2023 to 2024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2025 and Beyond\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standby letters of credit and similar instruments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Guarantees\n</td> <td>66.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total commercial commitments and letters of credit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________\n (1) Indebtedness amounts reflect the principal amount of our senior term loan, senior notes and credit facility. \n (2) Estimated interest payments are calculated assuming current interest rates over minimum maturity periods specified in debt agreements. Debt may be repaid sooner or later than such minimum maturity periods. \n (3) Other short-term and long-term obligations include estimates of future minimum contribution requirements under our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension and postretirement plans. These estimates are based on current legislation in the countries we operate within and are subject to change. Other short-term and long-term obligations also include income tax liabilities related to uncertain income tax positions connected with ongoing income tax audits in various jurisdictions. \nCommitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nGuarantees\nWe maintain a remarketing agreement with our finance joint venture in the United States, whereby we are obligated to repurchase up to $6.0 million of repossessed equipment each calendar year. We believe any losses that might be incurred on the resale of this equipment will not materially impact our financial position or results of operations, due to the fact that the repurchase obligation would be equivalent to the fair value of the underlying equipment.\nAt December 31, 2019, we guaranteed indebtedness owed to third parties of approximately $47.6 million, primarily related to dealer and end-user financing of equipment. Such guarantees generally obligate us to repay outstanding finance obligations owed to financial institutions if dealers or end users default on such loans through 2025. Losses under such guarantees historically have been insignificant. In addition, we generally would expect to be able to recover a significant portion of the amounts paid under such guarantees from the sale of the underlying financed farm equipment, as the fair value of such equipment is expected to offset a substantial portion of the amounts paid. We also have obligations to guarantee indebtedness owed to certain of our finance joint ventures if dealers or end users default on loans. Losses under such guarantees historically have been insignificant and the guarantees are not material. We believe the credit risk associated with all of these guarantees is not material to our financial position or results of operations.\nIn addition, at December 31, 2019, we had accrued approximately $18.9 million of outstanding guarantees of minimum residual values that may be owed to our finance joint ventures in the United States and Canada due upon expiration of certain eligible operating leases between the finance joint ventures and end users. The maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantee is approximately $26.7 million.\nOther\nAt December 31, 2019, we had outstanding designated and non-designated foreign exchange contracts with a gross notional amount of approximately $3,133.0 million. The outstanding contracts as of December 31, 2019 range in maturity through December 2020.\nAs discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources,\u201d we sell a majority of our wholesale accounts receivable in North America, Europe and Brazil to our U.S., Canadian, European and Brazilian finance joint ventures. We also sell certain accounts receivable under factoring arrangements to financial institutions around the world. We have determined that these facilities should be accounted for as off-balance sheet transactions.\nContingencies\nWe are party to various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business. We closely monitor these claims and lawsuits and frequently consult with our legal counsel to determine whether they may, when resolved, have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations and accrue and/or disclose loss contingencies as appropriate. See Note 12 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d and Item 3, Legal Proceedings,\u201d for further information.\nRelated Parties\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company engages in transactions with related parties. See Note 14 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d for information regarding related party transactions and their impact to our consolidated results of operations and financial position.\nForeign Currency Risk Management\nWe have significant manufacturing locations in the United States, France, Germany, Finland, Italy, China and Brazil, and we purchase a portion of our tractors, combines and components from third-party foreign suppliers, primarily in various European countries and in Japan. We also sell products in approximately 140 countries throughout the world. The majority of our net sales outside the United States are denominated in the currency of the customer location, with the exception of sales in Middle East, Africa, Asia and parts of South America, where net sales are primarily denominated in British pounds, Euros, or the United States dollar.\nWe manage our transactional foreign currency exposure by hedging foreign currency cash flow forecasts and commitments arising from the anticipated settlement of receivables and payables and from future purchases and sales. Where naturally offsetting currency positions do not occur, we hedge certain, but not all, of our exposures through the use of foreign currency contracts. Our translation exposure resulting from translating the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries into United States dollars may be partially hedged from time to time. When practical, this translation impact is reduced by financing local operations with local borrowings. Our hedging policy prohibits use of foreign currency contracts for speculative trading purposes.\nThe total notional value of our foreign currency instruments was $3,133.0 million and $1,462.8 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, inclusive of both those instruments that are designated and qualified for hedge accounting and non-designated derivative instruments. We enter into cash flow hedges to minimize the variability in cash flows of assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and we enter into foreign currency contracts to economically hedge receivables and payables on our balance sheets that are denominated in foreign currencies other than the functional currency. In addition, we use derivative and non-derivative instruments to hedge a portion of our net investment in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. See Note 11 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d for further information about our hedging transactions and derivative instruments.\nAssuming a 10% change relative to the currency of the hedge contracts, the fair value of the foreign currency instruments could be negatively impacted by approximately $22.3 million as of December 31, 2019. Due to the fact that these instruments are primarily entered into for hedging purposes, the gains or losses on the contracts would largely be offset by losses and gains on the underlying firm commitment or forecasted transaction.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur interest expense is, in part, sensitive to the general level of interest rates. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through our mix of floating rate and fixed rate debt. From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. See Notes 7 and 11 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d for additional information about our interest rate swap agreements.\nBased on our floating rate debt and our accounts receivable sales facilities outstanding at December 31, 2019, a 10% increase in interest rates, would have increased, collectively, Interest expense, net\u201d and Other expense, net\u201d for the year ended December 31, 2019 by approximately $5.6 million.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their impact to our consolidated results of operations and financial position.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In the preparation of these financial statements, we make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the financial statements are detailed in Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d We believe that our application of the policies discussed below involves significant levels of judgment, estimates and complexity.\nDue to the levels of judgment, complexity and period of time over which many of these items are resolved, actual results could differ from those estimated at the time of preparation of the financial statements. Adjustments to these estimates would impact our financial position and future results of operations.\nDiscount and Sales Incentive Allowances\nWe provide various volume bonus and sales incentive programs with respect to our products. These sales incentive programs include reductions in invoice prices, reductions in retail financing rates, dealer commissions and dealer incentive allowances. In most cases, incentive programs are established and communicated to our dealers on a quarterly basis. The incentives are paid either at the time of the cash settlement of the receivable (which is generally at the time of retail sale), at the time of retail financing, at the time of warranty registration, or at a subsequent time based on dealer purchase volumes. The incentive programs are product line specific and generally do not vary by dealer. The cost of sales incentives associated with dealer commissions and dealer incentive allowances is estimated based upon the terms of the programs and historical experience, is based on a percentage of the sales price, and estimates for sales incentives are made and recorded at the time of sale for expected incentive programs using the expected value method. These estimates are reassessed each reporting period and are revised in the event of subsequent modifications to incentive programs, as they are communicated to dealers. The related provisions and accruals are made on a product or product-line basis and are monitored for adequacy and revised at least quarterly in the event of subsequent modifications to the programs. Interest rate subsidy payments, which are a reduction in retail financing rates, are recorded in the same manner as dealer commissions and dealer incentive allowances. Volume discounts are estimated and recognized based on historical experience, and related reserves are monitored and adjusted based on actual dealer purchase volumes and the dealers' progress towards achieving specified cumulative target levels. Estimates of these incentives are based on the terms of the programs and historical experience. All incentive programs are recorded and presented as a reduction of revenue, due to the fact that we do not receive a distinct good or service in exchange for the consideration provided. In the United States and Canada, reserves for incentive programs related to accounts receivable not sold to our U.S. and Canadian finance joint ventures are recorded as accounts receivable allowances\u201d within our Consolidated Balance Sheets due to the fact that the incentives are paid through a reduction of future cash settlement of the receivable. Globally, reserves for incentive programs that will be paid in cash or credit memos, as is the case with most of our volume discount programs, as well as sales incentives associated with accounts receivable sold to our finance joint ventures, are recorded within Accrued expenses\u201d within our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had recorded an allowance for discounts and sales incentives of approximately $606.1 million that will be paid either through a reduction of future cash settlements of receivables and through credit memos\nto our dealers or through reductions in retail financing rates paid to our finance joint ventures. If we were to allow an additional 1% of sales incentives and discounts at the time of retail sale for those sales subject to such discount programs, our reserve would increase by approximately $21.0 million as of December 31, 2019. Conversely, if we were to decrease our sales incentives and discounts by 1% at the time of retail sale, our reserve would decrease by approximately $21.0 million as of December 31, 2019.\nDeferred Income Taxes and Uncertain Income Tax Positions\nWe recorded an income tax provision of $180.8 million in 2019 compared to $110.9 million in 2018 and $133.6 million in 2017. Our tax provision and effective tax rate are impacted by the differing tax rates of the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, permanent differences for items treated differently for financial accounting and income tax purposes, and for losses in jurisdictions where no income tax benefit is recorded.\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, we recorded a non-cash adjustment to establish a valuation allowance against our Brazilian net deferred income tax assets of approximately $53.7 million. In addition, we maintain a valuation allowance to fully reserve against our net deferred tax assets in the United States and certain other foreign jurisdictions. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We assessed the likelihood that our deferred tax assets would be recovered from estimated future taxable income and available tax planning strategies and determined that the adjustment to the valuation allowance was appropriate. In making this assessment, all available evidence was considered including the current economic climate, as well as reasonable tax planning strategies. We believe it is more likely than not that we will realize our remaining net deferred tax assets, net of the valuation allowance, in future years.\nSwiss tax reform was enacted during 2019 and eliminates certain preferential tax items as well as implements new tax rates at both the federal and cantonal levels. During the three months ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized a one-time income tax gain of approximately $21.8 million associated with the changing of Swiss federal and cantonal tax rates as well as recognition of a deferred tax asset associated with the estimated value of a tax basis step-up of our Swiss subsidiary's assets.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( the 2017 Tax Act\u201d) was enacted in the United States. During the three months ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a tax provision of approximately $42.0 million in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which provided SEC Staff guidance for the application of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 740 Income Taxes,\u201d in the reporting period in which the 2017 Tax Act was enacted. The $42.0 million tax provision included a provisional income tax charge related to a one-time transition tax associated with the mandatory deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. The tax provision also included a provisional income tax charge associated with the income tax consequences related to the expected future repatriation of certain underlying foreign earnings, as historically, we have considered them to be permanently reinvested. The remaining balance of the tax provision primarily related to the remeasurement of certain net deferred tax assets using the lower enacted U.S. Corporate tax rate (from 35% to 21%), as well as other miscellaneous related impacts. During the three months ended December 31, 2018, we finalized our calculations related to the 2017 Tax Act and recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $8.4 million.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had gross deferred tax assets of $396.0 million and $350.2 million, respectively, including $72.0 million and $74.5 million, respectively, related to net operating loss carryforwards. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had total valuation allowances as an offset to our gross deferred tax assets of $169.1 million and $83.9 million, respectively, which included allowances primarily against net operating loss carryforwards in Brazil, China, Hungary, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, as well as allowances against our net deferred taxes primarily in the U.S. and Brazil, as previously discussed. Realization of the remaining deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2019 will depend on generating sufficient taxable income in future periods, net of reversing deferred tax liabilities. We believe it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized.\nWe recognize income tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only when there is a more than 50% likelihood that the tax positions will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the positions. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had approximately $210.7 million and $166.1 million, respectively, of gross unrecognized tax benefits, all of which would impact our effective tax rate if recognized. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had approximately $51.0 million and $58.5 million, respectively, of current accrued taxes related to uncertain income tax positions connected with ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions that we expect to settle or pay in the next 12 months. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $28.4 million and $27.2 million, respectively. See Note 6 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our uncertain income tax positions.\nPensions\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees, principally in the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, Switzerland, Finland, France, Norway and Argentina. Our primary plans cover certain employees in the United States and the United Kingdom.\nIn the United States, we sponsor a funded, qualified defined benefit pension plan for our salaried employees, as well as a separate funded qualified defined benefit pension plan for our hourly employees. Both plans are closed to new entrants and frozen, and we fund at least the minimum contributions required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code to both plans. In addition, we maintain an unfunded, nonqualified defined benefit pension plan for certain senior executives, which is our Executive Nonqualified Pension Plan ( ENPP\u201d). The ENPP is also closed to new entrants.\nIn the United Kingdom, we sponsor a funded defined benefit pension plan that provides an annuity benefit based on participants' final average earnings and service. Participation in this plan is limited to certain older, longer service employees and existing retirees. This plan is closed to new participants.\nSee Note 8 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d for additional information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits.\nNature of Estimates Required. The measurement date for all of our benefit plans is December 31. The measurement of our pension obligations, costs and liabilities is dependent on a variety of assumptions provided by management and used by our actuaries. These assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience. These assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions.\nAssumptions and Approach Used. The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include, but are not limited to, the following key factors: Table 50: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022 Discount rates\n</td> <td>\u2022 Inflation\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022 Salary growth\n</td> <td>\u2022 Expected return on plan assets\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022 Retirement rates and ages\n</td> <td>\u2022 Mortality rates\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we used a globally consistent methodology to set the discount rate in the countries where our largest benefit obligations exist. In the United States, the United Kingdom and the Euro Zone, we constructed a hypothetical bond portfolio of high-quality corporate bonds and then applied the cash flows of our benefit plans to those bond yields to derive a discount rate. The bond portfolio and plan-specific cash flows vary by country, but the methodology in which the portfolio is constructed is consistent. In the United States, the bond portfolio is large enough to result in taking a settlement approach\u201d to derive the discount rate, in which high-quality corporate bonds are assumed to be purchased and the resulting coupon payments and maturities are used to satisfy our U.S. pension plans' projected benefit payments. In the United Kingdom and the Euro Zone, the discount rate is derived using a yield curve approach,\u201d in which an individual spot rate, or zero coupon bond yield, for each future annual period is developed to discount each future benefit payment and, thereby, determine the present value of all future payments. The Company uses a spot yield curve to determine the discount rate applicable in the United Kingdom to measure the U.K. pension plan's service cost and interest cost. Under the settlement and yield curve approaches, the discount rate is set to equal the single discount rate that produces the same present value of all future payments.\nThe other key assumptions and methods were set as follows:\n \u2022 Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. \n \u2022 The salary growth assumptions reflect our long-term actual experience, the near-term outlook and assumed inflation. \n \u2022 The expected return on plan asset assumptions reflects asset allocations, investment strategy, historical experience and the views of investment managers, and reflects a projection of the expected arithmetic returns over ten years. \n \u2022 Determination of retirement rates and ages as well as termination rates, based on actual plan experience, actuarial standards of practice and the manner in which our defined benefit plans are being administered. \n \u2022 The mortality rates for the U.K. defined benefit pension plan was updated in 2019 to reflect the latest expected improvements in the life expectancy of the plan participants. The mortality rates for the U.S. defined benefit pension plans were updated in 2019 to reflect the Society of Actuaries' most recent findings on the topic of mortality. \n \u2022 The fair value of assets used to determine the expected return on assets does not reflect any delayed recognition of asset gains and losses. \nThe effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such periods.\nOur U.S. and U.K. defined benefit pension plans, including our ENPP, comprised approximately 86% of our consolidated projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2019. If the discount rate used to determine the 2019 projected benefit obligation for our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans and our ENPP was decreased by 25 basis points, our projected benefit obligation would have increased by approximately $4.8 million at December 31, 2019, and our 2020 pension expense would increase by approximately $0.5 million. If the discount rate used to determine the 2019 projected benefit obligation for our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans and our ENPP was increased by 25 basis points, our projected benefit obligation would have decreased by approximately $4.5 million at December 31, 2019, and our 2020 pension expense would decrease by approximately $0.5 million. If the discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for our U.K. defined benefit pension plan was decreased by 25 basis points, our projected benefit obligation would have increased by approximately $25.3 million at December 31, 2019, and our 2020 pension expense would increase by approximately $0.2 million. If the discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for our U.K. defined benefit pension plan was increased by 25 basis points, our projected benefit obligation would have decreased by approximately $23.1 million at December 31, 2019, and our 2020 pension expense would decrease by approximately $0.3 million. In addition, if the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets related to our U.K. defined benefit pension plan was increased or decreased by 25 basis points, our 2020 pension expense would decrease or increase by approximately $1.6 million each, respectively. The impact to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans for a 25-basis-point change in our expected long-term rate of return would decrease or increase our 2020 pension expense by approximately $0.1 million, respectively.\nUnrecognized actuarial net losses related to our defined benefit pension plans and ENPP were $362.2 million as of December 31, 2019 compared to $356.7 million as of December 31, 2018. The increase in unrecognized net actuarial losses between years primarily resulted from lower discount rates at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018. The unrecognized net actuarial losses will be impacted in future periods by actual asset returns, discount rate changes, currency exchange rate fluctuations, actual demographic experience and certain other factors. For some of our defined benefit pension plans, these losses, to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater of the plan's liabilities or the fair value of assets ( the gain/loss corridor\u201d), will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods discussed as follows. For our U.S. salaried, U.S. hourly and U.K. defined benefit pension plans, the population covered is predominantly inactive participants, and losses related to those plans, to the extent they exceed the gain/loss corridor, will be amortized over the average remaining lives of those participants while covered by the respective plan. For our ENPP, the population is predominantly active participants, and losses related to the plan will be amortized over the average future working lifetime of the active participants expected to receive benefits. As of December 31, 2019, the average amortization periods were as follows: Table 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>ENPP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U.S. Plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U.K. Plan\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average amortization period of losses related to defined benefit pension plans\n</td> <td>7 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19 years\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnrecognized prior service cost related to our defined benefit pension plans was $22.5 million as of December 31, 2019 compared to $19.5 million as of December 31, 2018. The increase in the unrecognized prior service cost between years is due primarily to a plan amendment related to our ENPP.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our unfunded or underfunded obligations related to our defined benefit pension plans and ENPP were approximately $206.3 million, primarily related to our defined benefit pension plans in Europe and the United States. In 2019, we contributed approximately $30.6 million towards those obligations, and we expect to fund approximately $33.6 million in 2020. Future funding is dependent upon compliance with local laws and regulations and changes to those laws and regulations in the future, as well as the generation of operating cash flows in the future. We currently have an agreement in place with the trustees of the U.K. defined benefit plan that obligates us to fund approximately \u00a315.3 million per year (or approximately $20.2 million) towards that obligation through December 2021. The funding arrangement is based upon the current funded status and could change in the future as discount rates, local laws and regulations, and other factors change.\nSee Note 8 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d for more information regarding the investment strategy and concentration of risk.\nGoodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets\nWe test goodwill for impairment, at the reporting unit level, annually and when events or circumstances indicate that fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying value. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, for example, a component. We combine and aggregate two or more components of an operating segment as a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. Our reportable segments are not our reporting units.\nGoodwill is evaluated for impairment annually as of October 1 using a qualitative assessment or a quantitative one-step assessment. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value of our reporting units more likely than not exceeds their carrying value of net assets, no further evaluation is necessary. For reporting units where we perform a one-step quantitative assessment, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its respective carrying value of net assets, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value of net assets, the goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying value of net assets is higher than the fair value of the reporting unit, the impairment charge is the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's fair value.\nWe utilize a combination of valuation techniques, including a discounted cash flow approach and a market multiple approach, when making quantitative goodwill assessments.\nWe review our long-lived assets, which include intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation for recoverability is performed at a level where independent cash flows may be attributed to either an asset or asset group. If we determine that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group is not recoverable based on the"
