(\"Revlon\"), which is an indirect majority-owned subsidiary of MacAndrews & Forbes Incorporated (together with certain of its affiliates other than Revlon and the Company, \"MacAndrews & Forbes\"), a corporation wholly-owned by Ronald O. Perelman.\nThe Company operates in four segments: the consumer division ( Consumer\u201d); the professional division ( Professional\u201d); Elizabeth Arden; and Other. The Company manufactures, markets and sells an extensive array of beauty and personal care products worldwide, including color cosmetics, fragrances, skin care, hair color, hair care and hair treatments, beauty tools, men's grooming products, anti-perspirant deodorants and other beauty care products.\nFor additional information regarding our business, see \"Part 1, Item 1 - Business\" in this Form 10-K.\nDiscontinued Operations Presentation\nAs a result of the Company's decision on December 30, 2013 to exit its direct manufacturing, warehousing and sales business operations in mainland China within its Consumer segment effective December 31, 2013, the Company is reporting the results of its former China operations within income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income. Unless otherwise stated, financial results discussed within \"Overview\" and \"Results of Operations\" refer only to continuing operations. See Note 4, \"Discontinued Operations,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion.\nOverview of Net Sales and Earnings Results\nConsolidated net sales in 2016 were $2,334.0 million, an increase of $419.7 million, or 21.9%, compared to $1,914.3 million in 2015. Excluding the $43.9 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations (referred to herein as FX,\u201d XFX\u201d or on an \"XFX basis\"), consolidated net sales increased by $463.6 million, or 24.2%, in 2016 compared to the 2015. The XFX increase in 2016 was primarily driven by the inclusion of $441.4 million of net sales as a result of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition from and after the September 7, 2016 Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date; a $11.1 million, or 2.4%, increase in Professional segment net sales; and a $9.7 million, or 0.7%, increase in Consumer segment net sales.\nConsolidated loss from continuing operations, net of taxes, in 2016 was $10.8 million, compared to $65.3 million of consolidated income from continuing operations, net of taxes, in 2015. The $76.1 million decrease in consolidated income from continuing operations, net of taxes, in 2016 was primarily due to:\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$158.1 million of higher SG&A expenses, primarily driven by the inclusion of the SG&A expenses of the Elizabeth Arden segment, commencing on and after the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$35.2 million increase in acquisition and integration costs, primarily related to the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$23.5 million increase in restructuring charges and other, net, in 2016, which primarily included $31.7 million in restructuring charges recognized in 2016 related to the EA Integration Restructuring Program, as compared to $9.5 million of restructuring charges and other, net, recognized in 2015, primarily due to the 2015 Efficiency Program;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $23.4 million non-cash impairment loss on goodwill and acquired intangible assets for the Company's Other reporting unit recognized in 2016, as compared to a $9.7 million non-cash impairment loss on goodwill for the Company's Global Color Brands reporting unit recognized in 2015;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $21.9 million increase in interest expense incurred during 2016 primarily as a result of the debt-related transactions completed during the third quarter of 2016 in connection with financing the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition and the complete refinancing of the Old Term Loan Facility, as discussed below; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $16.9 million aggregate loss on the early extinguishment of debt recognized in the third quarter of 2016 as a result of the complete refinancing of the Old Term Loan Facility in connection with the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nwith the foregoing partially offset by:\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$170.4 million of higher gross profit in 2016, primarily due to the inclusion of gross profit of the Elizabeth Arden segment, commencing on and after the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date, partially offset by lower gross profit within the Consumer segment; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $25.7 million decrease in the provision for income taxes recognized in 2016, primarily due to lower pre-tax income for 2016, as compared to 2015, partially offset by the impairment in 2016 related to the Company's Other segment for which there was no tax benefit and the tax benefit realized in 2015 for the reduction of the deferred tax valuation allowance that did not exist in 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> These items are discussed in more detail within \"Results of Operations\" and within \"Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below.\nRecent Events\nAcquisition of Elizabeth Arden\nOn September 7, 2016, the Company completed the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition. Elizabeth Arden is a global prestige beauty products company with an iconic portfolio of fragrance, skin care and color cosmetics brands that are highly complementary to the Company's existing brand portfolio and are sold worldwide. Elizabeth Arden's brands include Skin Illuminating, SUPERSTART, Prevage, Eight Hour Cream, Elizabeth Arden Ceramide and Visible Difference in the Elizabeth Arden skin care brands; Elizabeth Arden Red Door, Elizabeth Arden 5th Avenue, Elizabeth Arden Green Tea and UNTOLD in Elizabeth Arden fragrances; Juicy Couture, John Varvatos, and Wildfox Couture in designer fragrances; and Curve, Elizabeth Taylor, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Halston, Ed Hardy, Geoffrey Beene, Alfred Sung, Giorgio Beverly Hills, Lucky Brand, PS Fine Cologne for Men, White Shoulders and Jennifer Aniston in heritage fragrances. In North America, Elizabeth Arden's principal customers include prestige retailers, specialty stores, the mass retail channel, distributors, department stores and other retailers, as well as direct sales to consumers via its Elizabeth Arden Red Door branded retail stores and Elizabeth Arden.com e-commerce business. Elizabeth Arden products are also sold through the Elizabeth Arden Red Door Spa beauty salons and spas. Internationally, Elizabeth Arden's portfolio of owned and licensed brands is sold to perfumeries, boutiques, department stores, travel retailers and distributors. The operating results and purchase accounting for the Company's Elizabeth Arden Acquisition are presented in the Elizabeth Arden reporting segment.\nEA Integration Restructuring Program\nIn December 2016, in connection with integrating the Elizabeth Arden and Revlon organizations, the Company determined to begin the process of implementing the EA Integration Restructuring Program, consisting of certain integration activities, including consolidating offices, eliminating certain duplicative activities and streamlining back-office support. The EA Integration Restructuring Program is designed to reduce the Company's SG&A expenses. As a result of the EA Integration Restructuring Program, the Company expects to eliminate approximately 350 positions worldwide and expects to recognize approximately $65 million to $75 million of EA Integration Restructuring Charges, consisting of: (i) approximately $40 million to $50 million of employee-related costs, including severance, retention and other contractual termination benefits; (ii) approximately $15 million of lease termination costs; and (iii) approximately $10 million of other related charges.\nAs a result of the EA Integration Restructuring Program, as well as other actions related to integrating the Elizabeth Arden organiz\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nation into the Company's business, the Company has identified annualized synergies and cost reductions of approximately $190 million. The approximately $190 million of expected annualized synergies and cost reductions are expected to be generated over a multi-year period, with approximately 90% expected to be achieved by the end of 2020. For 2016, the Company realized approximately $3 million of these annualized cost reductions, which primarily benefited the Elizabeth Arden segment results.\nIn order to capture these annualized synergies and cost reductions, the Company anticipates that it will incur, over a multi-year period, approximately $100 million to $110 million of cumulative integration-related capital expenditures and approximately $70 million to $80 million of cumulative non-restructuring integration costs.\nIn 2016, the Company incurred $34.5 million of restructuring charges in connection with the EA Integration Integration Restructuring Program and $41.7 million of acquisition and integration costs related to the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition.\nFor further discussion of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition and the EA Integration Restructuring Program, see Note 2, \"Business Combinations,\" and Note 3, \"Restructuring Charges - EA Integration Restructuring Program,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nAcquisition of Cutex International\nOn May 31, 2016, the Company completed the Cutex International Acquisition, consisting of the acquisition of certain international Cutex businesses from Coty Inc., which primarily operate in Australia and the U.K., and related assets for total cash consideration of $29.1 million. Following the Company's October 2015 Cutex U.S. Acquisition, combined with other Cutex businesses that the Company acquired in 1998, the Cutex International Acquisition completed the Company's global consolidation of the Cutex brand, enhancing and complementing the Company's existing brand portfolio of nail care products. The Cutex International results of operations are included in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements commencing on the Cutex International Acquisition Date. See Note 2, \"Business Combinations,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further details related to the Cutex International Acquisition.\n2016 Debt-Related Transactions\nIn connection with and substantially concurrently with the closing of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, Products Corporation entered into: (i) its 7-year $1,800.0 million senior secured 2016 Term Loan Facility; and (ii) its 5-year $400.0 million 2016 Revolving Credit Facility. As part of financing the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, in August 2016 Products Corporation also completed the issuances of $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.25% Senior Notes due 2024, which funds were released from escrow on the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date. In connection with entering into the 2016 Senior Credit Facilities, Products Corporation maintained on the 2016 Term Loan Facility its existing floating-to-fixed 2013 Interest Rate Swap based on a notional amount of $400 million that previously applied to Products Corporation's Old Acquisition Term Loan, which loan was refinanced in full in connection with Products Corporation's consummation of the 2016 Senior Credit Facilities and the 6.25% Senior Notes. The proceeds of Products Corporation's 6.25% Senior Notes Offering and the 2016 Term Loan Facility, together with approximately $35.0 million of borrowings under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, and approximately $126.7 million of cash on hand, were used: (A) to fund the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, including: (i) repurchasing the entire $350.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Elizabeth Arden Senior Notes; (ii) repaying the entire $142.0 million aggregate principal amount of borrowings outstanding as of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date under Elizabeth Arden's then-existing $300.0 million revolving credit facility (which facility was terminated upon such repayment); (iii) repaying the entire $25.0 million aggregate principal amount of borrowings then-outstanding as of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date under Elizabeth Arden's second lien credit facility (which facility was terminated upon such repayment); and (iv) retiring the entire $55.0 million liquidation preference of all 50,000 shares of Elizabeth Arden's issued and outstanding Preferred Stock (which amount included a $5.0 million change of control premium); and (B) to completely refinance and repay all of the $651.4 million in aggregate principal balance outstanding under Products Corporation's 2011 Term Loan and all of the $658.6 million in aggregate principal balance outstanding under Products Corporation's Old Acquisition Term Loan (each of which facilities were terminated upon such repayment). The Company did not incur any material early termination penalties in connection with repaying the Old Term Loan Facility or the Elizabeth Arden indebtedness and preferred stock.\nIn February 2016, Products Corporation prepaid $23.2 million of indebtedness then outstanding under the Old Term Loan Facility, representing 50% of its 2015 excess cash flow\u201d as defined by, and as required under, the Old Term Loan Agreement. The prepayment was applied on a ratable basis between the principal amounts outstanding under the 2011 Term Loan and the Old Acquisition Term Loan. The amount of the prepayment that was applied to the 2011 Term Loan reduced the principal amount outstanding by $11.5 million to $651.4 million (as all amortization payments under the 2011 Term Loan had been paid). The $11.7 million that was applied to the Old Acquisition Term Loan reduced Products Corporation's future annual amortization payments under such loan on a ratable basis from $6.9 million prior to the prepayment to $6.8 million after giving effect to the prepayment.\nSee Part II, Item 7 - \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Long-Term Debt Instruments,\u201d for further discussion of the above debt transactions.\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nNon-cash Impairment Charges\nFor purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test, the CBB business, which was acquired in April 2015, is included within the Company's Other reporting unit. The results of the step one test indicated that impairment indicators may have existed for the Company's Other reporting unit due to the termination of certain fragrance licenses that were not replaced, and accordingly, the Company performed step two of the goodwill impairment test for this reporting unit. As a result, in conjunction with the Company's annual impairment test, the Company recognized $23.4 million in non-cash impairment charges during the fourth quarter of 2016. Of this amount, $16.7 million related to goodwill and $6.7 million related to intangible assets acquired in the CBB Acquisition. These non-cash impairment charges are primarily due to the Company's expectations regarding the future performance of the Other reporting unit, in relation to the carrying amounts of CBB's goodwill and acquired intangible assets. See Note 8, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further details on these non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges.\nOperating Segments\nThe Company operates in four reporting segments: the consumer division ( Consumer\u201d); the professional division ( Professional\u201d); Elizabeth Arden; and Other:\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The Consumer segment is comprised of the Company's consumer brands, which primarily include Revlon, Almay, SinfulColors and Pure Ice in color cosmetics; Revlon ColorSilk in women's hair color; Revlon in beauty tools; and Mitchum in anti-perspirant deodorants. The Company's principal customers for its consumer products include large volume retailers, chain drug and food stores, chemist shops, hypermarkets, general merchandise stores, the Internet/e-commerce, television shopping, department stores, one-stop shopping beauty retailers, specialty cosmetics stores and perfumeries in the U.S. and internationally. The Consumer segment also includes a skin care line under the Natural Honey brand and a hair color line under the Llongueras brand (licensed from a third party) sold to large volume retailers and other retailers, primarily in Spain, which were acquired as part of the Colomer Acquisition. In October 2015 and in May 2016, the Company acquired Cutex businesses in the U.S. and in certain international territories and related assets, respectively. The results of operations relating to the sales of Cutex nail care products are included within the Consumer segment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The Professional segment is comprised primarily of the Company's professional brands, which include Revlon Professional in hair color and hair care; CND-branded products in nail polishes and nail enhancements; and American Crew in men's grooming products, all of which are sold worldwide to professional salons.

Excluding the $43.9 million unfavorable FX impact, consolidated net sales increased on an XFX basis by $463.6 million, or 24.2%, during 2016.\nConsolidated net sales in 2015 were $1,914.3 million, a decrease of $26.7 million, or 1.4%, compared to $1,941.0 million in 2014. Excluding the $121.2 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, consolidated net sales increased $94.5 million, or 4.9%, during 2015, primarily driven by an increase in Consumer segment net sales of $53.9 million, or 3.7%, and the inclusion of $28.4 million of net sales as a result of the CBB Acquisition.\nSee \"Segment Results\" below for further discussion.\nSegment Results:\nThe Company's management evaluates segment profit, which is defined as income from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, gains/losses on foreign currency fluctuations, gains/losses on the early extinguishment of debt and miscellaneous expenses, for each of the Company's reportable segments. Segment profit also excludes unallocated corporate expenses and the impact of certain items that are not directly attributable to the segments' underlying operating performance, which includes the impact of: (i) restructuring and related charges; (ii) acquisition and integration costs; (iii) deferred compensation related to the accounting for the CBB Acquisition; (iv) costs of sales resulting from fair value adjustments in the second quarter of 2016 and 2015 related to inventory acquired in the Cutex International Acquisition and the CBB Acquisition, respectively; (v) charges related to the Elizabeth Arden 2016 Business Transformation Program; (vi) costs of sales resulting from a fair value adjustment to inventory acquired in the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition; (vii) goodwill and acquired intangible asset impairment charges; and (viii) pension lump sum settlement charges. Unallocated corporate expenses primarily include general and administrative expenses related to the corporate organization. These expenses are recorded in unallocated corporate expenses as these items are centrally directed and controlled and are not included in internal measures of segment operating performance. The Company does not have any material inter-segment sales. For a reconciliation of segment profit to income from continuing operations before income taxes, see Note 19, \"Segment Data and Related Information,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this

excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\nConsumer Segment\nConsumer segment net sales in 2016 were $1,389.8 million, a $25.0 million or 1.8% decrease, compared to $1,414.8 million in 2015. Excluding the $34.7 million unfavorable FX impact, total Consumer net sales in 2016 increased by $9.7 million, or 0.7%, compared to 2015. This increase was primarily driven by higher net sales of Cutex nail care products from the Company's global consolidation of the Cutex brand, which was completed with two separate acquisitions that closed for the U.S. in October 2015 and for the U.K., Australia and certain other International territories in May 2016, as well as higher net sales of Revlon beauty tools and Mitchum anti-perspirant deodorant products, partially offset by lower net sales of Almay color cosmetics. Net sales of Revlon color cosmetics were essentially flat, as strong sales growth internationally was offset by lower net sales in North America due to softening trade conditions in core cosmetics categories.\nConsumer segment profit in 2016 was $349.2 million, a $11.0 million, or 3.1%, decrease, as compared to $360.2 million in 2015. Excluding the $2.7 million unfavorable FX impact, Consumer segment profit in 2016 decreased by $8.3 million, or 2.3%, compared to 2015. This decrease was partially due to a 2015 gain of $3.5 million related to the sale of a non-core consumer brand. In addition, Consumer segment profit decreased due to the unfavorable impact of FX transaction within cost of sales, partially offset by decreased brand support on lower performing brands.\nConsumer segment net sales in 2015 were $1,414.8 million, a decrease of $23.5 million, or 1.6%, as compared to $1,438.3 million in 2014. Excluding the $77.4 million unfavorable FX impact, total Consumer net sales in 2015 increased $53.9 million, or 3.7%, as compared to 2014, primarily driven by higher net sales of Revlon color cosmetics, Mitchum anti-perspirant deodorant products, Revlon ColorSilk hair color and Cutex nail products, partially offset by lower net sales of Almay color cosmetics. Consumer segment net sales were negatively impacted in connection with the Company's exit of its business operations in Venezuela in the second quarter of 2015 and change to a distributor model, as such change resulted in $1.0 million of net sales in Venezuela in 2015, compared to $16.3 million of net sales in Venezuela in 2014. Excluding Venezuela, on an XFX basis, Consumer net sales would have increased by 4.4% in 2015, as compared to 2014.\nConsumer segment profit in 2015 was $360.2 million, an increase of $20.8 million, or 6.1%, as compared to $339.4 million in 2014. Excluding the $9.2 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, Consumer segment profit in 2015 increased $30.0 million, or 8.8%, as compared to 2014, primarily driven by higher gross profit as a result of the increases in net sales discussed above, partially offset by $8.7 million of higher brand support expenses for the Company's Consumer brands. In connection with the Company's exit of its business operations in Venezuela in the second quarter of 2015 and change to a distributor model, there was no profit in Venezuela in 2015, compared to $6.6 million of profit in Venezuela in 2014. Excluding Venezuela, on an XFX basis, Consumer segment profit would have increased by 11.1% in 2015, as compared to 2014.\nProfessional Segment\nProfessional segment net sales in 2016 were $476.5 million, a $5.4 million, or 1.1%, increase, as compared to $471.1 million in 2015. Excluding the $5.7 million unfavorable FX impact, total Professional net sales in 2016 increased by $11.1 million as compared to 2015. This increase was driven primarily by higher net sales of American Crew men's grooming products as a result of the Elvis Presley branded marketing campaign and Revlon Professional hair products in part due to the launch of Revlon Professional Be Fabulous and Revlonissimo Colorsmetique. These increases were partially offset by lower net sales of CND nail products.\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nProfessional segment profit in 2016 was $99.4 million, a $4.5 million, or 4.3%, decrease, as compared to $103.9 million in 2015, primarily driven by the absence in 2016 of a $3.0 million gain related to the sale of a non-core professional brand that was completed in 2015.\nProfessional segment net sales in 2015 were $471.1 million, a decrease of $31.6 million, or 6.3%, compared to $502.7 million in 2014. Excluding the $43.8 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, total Professional net sales increased by $12.2 million in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily as a result of higher net sales of American Crew men's grooming products, Revlon Professional hair products and Creme of Nature hair products, partially offset by lower net sales of CND nail products in the U.S.\nProfessional segment profit in 2015 was $103.9 million, a decrease of $0.9 million, or 0.9%, compared to $104.8 million in 2014. Excluding the $3.7 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, Professional segment profit increased $2.8 million in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to higher net sales, partially offset by $5.1 million of higher brand support expenses for the Company's Professional brands and a favorable adjustment in 2014 of $3.4 million related to the inventory obsolescence reserve, with no similar adjustment in 2015.\nElizabeth Arden Segment\nThe Elizabeth Arden segment is comprised of the operations acquired by the Company in the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, which closed on September 7, 2016. An analysis of net sales and segment profit for the Elizabeth Arden segment for 2016 is not included in this Form 10-K, as the Company does not have any comparable prior year's net sales or segment profit for the Elizabeth Arden segment.\nElizabeth Arden operations have historically been seasonal, with higher net sales generally occurring in the second half of the calendar year as a result of increased demand by retailers in anticipation of and during the holiday season. As a result, the operating results of the Elizabeth Arden segment following the Acquisition Date include the effects of seasonality.\nOther Segment\nOther segment net sales in 2016 were $26.3 million, a $2.1 million, or 7.4%, decrease, compared to $28.4 million in 2015. Excluding the $3.5 million unfavorable FX impact, total Other segment net sales in 2016 increased by $1.4 million, or 4.9%, compared to 2015. This increase was primarily driven by net sales associated with newly-acquired distribution rights in Europe.\nOther segment loss in 2016 was $2.7 million, a $4.1 million decrease, compared to a $1.4 million profit in 2015. This decrease was primarily driven by higher packaging and design expenses.\nGeographic Results:\nIn connection with changes that the organization made to its management reporting structure following the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, beginning with the third quarter of 2016, the Company has combined its former U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico operating regions into the North America region for reporting purposes. The Company has modified its net sales discussion to conform to management's procedures for reviewing the business, and, accordingly, the amounts for 2016, 2015 and 2014 have been restated to conform to this presentation.\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in

in 2015. Excluding the $2.0 million unfavorable FX impact, Consumer segment net sales in North America in 2016 decreased by $36.9 million, or 4.0%, as compared to 2015. This decrease was primarily driven by the results of softening trade conditions in core categories, which impacted Revlon color cosmetics and Almay color cosmetics, as well as increased competition impacting Revlon ColorSilk hair color. These decreases were partially offset by incremental net sales in connection with the Company completing the global consolidation of the Cutex nail care brand, as well as higher net sales of Revlon beauty tools.\nIn the Consumer segment, North America net sales in 2015 increased by $20.6 million, or 2.3%, to $921.3 million, as compared to $900.7 million in 2014. Excluding the $8.7 million unfavorable FX impact, Consumer segment net sales in North America\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nincreased by $29.3 million, or 3.3%, in 2015, as compared to 2014. This increase was primarily driven by higher net sales of Revlon color cosmetics, Mitchum anti-perspirant deodorant products and Revlon ColorSilk hair color, partially offset by lower net sales of Almay color cosmetics.\nInternational\nIn the Consumer segment, International net sales in 2016 increased by $13.9 million, or 2.8%, to $507.4 million, as compared to $493.5 million in 2015. Excluding the $32.7 million unfavorable FX impact, Consumer segment International net sales in 2016 increased by $46.6 million, or 9.4%, as compared to 2015. This increase was primarily driven by higher net sales of Revlon color cosmetics, Revlon ColorSilk hair color, as well as incremental net sales of Cutex nail care products. The increase in International net sales was mainly driven by higher net sales in Argentina, the U.K. and Mexico.\nIn the Consumer segment, International net sales in 2015 decreased by $44.1 million, or 8.2% to $493.5 million, as compared to $537.6 million in 2014. Excluding the $68.7 million unfavorable FX impact, Consumer segment International net sales increased by 24.6 million, or 4.6%, in 2015, as compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher net sales of Revlon color cosmetics. The Company's exit of its business operations in Venezuela in 2015 negatively impacted International net sales. Excluding Venezuela, on an XFX basis, International net sales would have increased by 10.0% in 2015, as compared to 2014.\nProfessional Segment\nNorth America\nIn the Professional segment, North America net sales in 2016 increased by $3.1 million, or 1.5%, to $204.9 million, as compared to $201.8 million in 2015. Excluding the $0.8 million unfavorable FX impact, Professional segment net sales in North America in 2016 increased on an XFX basis by $3.9 million, or 1.9%, as compared to 2015. This increase was primarily driven by increased net sales of American Crew men's grooming products as a result of the Elvis Presley branded marketing campaign as well as Creme of Nature hair products, partially offset by lower net sales of CND nail products.\nIn the Professional segment, North America net sales in 2015 decreased by $12.5 million, or 5.8%, to $201.8 million, as compared to $214.3 million in 2014. Excluding the $3.7 million unfavorable FX impact, Professional segment net sales in North America decreased on an XFX basis by $8.8 million, or 4.1%, in 2015, as compared to 2014. This decrease was primarily driven by lower net sales of CND nail products.\nInternational\nIn the Professional segment, International net sales in 2016 increased by $2.3 million, or 0.9%, to $271.6 million, as compared to $269.3 million in 2015. Excluding the $4.9 million unfavorable FX impact, Professional segment International net sales increased by $7.2 million, or 2.7%, in 2016, as compared to 2015. This increase was primarily due to higher net sales of Revlon Professional hair products, in part due to the launch of Revlon Professional Be Fabulous, as well as an increase in net sales of American Crew men's grooming products throughout most of the International region. These increases were partially offset by lower net sales of CND nail products.\nIn the Professional segment, International net sales in 2015 decreased by $19.1 million, or 6.6%, to $269.3 million, as compared to $288.4 million in 2014. Excluding the $40.1 million unfavorable FX impact, Professional segment International net sales in 2015 increased by $21.0 million, or 7.3%, as compared to 2014. This increase was primarily due to higher net sales of American Crew men's grooming products and Revlon Professional hair products throughout most of the International region.\nElizabeth Arden Segment\nThe Elizabeth Arden segment is comprised of the operations acquired by the Company in the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition which closed on September 7, 2016. Therefore, an analysis of net sales and segment profit for the Elizabeth Arden segment for 2016 is not included in this Form 10-K, as the Company does not have any comparable prior year's net sales or segment profit for the Elizabeth Arden segment.\nElizabeth Arden operations have historically been seasonal, with higher net sales generally occurring in the second half of the calendar year as a result of increased demand by retailers in anticipation of and during the holiday season. As a result, the operating results of the Elizabeth Arden segment following the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date include the effects of seasonality.\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nOther Segment\nNorth America\nThe Other segment consists of operations primarily within the International region.

(ii) lower pre-tax income in certain jurisdictions for 2015, as compared to 2014; (iii) the impact of the favorable resolution of certain tax matters in 2015; and (iv) the unfavorable impact of certain tax matters in 2014 that did not recur in 2015.\nThe Company's effective tax rate for 2016 was higher than the 35% federal statutory rate as a result of: (i) state and local taxes; (ii) foreign dividends and earnings taxable in the U.S.; and (iii) the impairment related to the Company's Other segment for which there was no tax benefit.\nThe Company's effective tax rate for 2015 was higher than the federal statutory rate of 35% due principally to: (i) foreign and U.S. tax effects attributable to operations outside the U.S.; (ii) state and local taxes; and (iii) foreign dividends and earnings taxable in the U.S., partially offset by the net reduction of valuation allowances in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nThe Company expects that its tax provision and effective tax rate in any individual quarter and year-to-date period will vary and may not be indicative of the Company's tax provision and effective tax rate for the full year.\nIn assessing the recoverability of its deferred tax assets, management regularly considers whether some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized based on the recognition threshold and measurement of a tax position. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is generally dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. See Note 16, Income Taxes,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company had a liquidity position of $545.9 million, consisting of $167.1 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, as well as $378.8 million in available borrowings under Products Corporation's $400.0 million 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, based upon the borrowing base of $389.2 million, less $10.4 million of outstanding undrawn letters of credit, and nil outstanding under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility at such date.\nThe Company's foreign operations held $128.5 million out of the total $186.8 million in cash and cash equivalents (net of any outstanding checks) as of December 31, 2016. The cash held by the Company's foreign operations is primarily used to fund such operations. The Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources of cash to fund these needs. As part of this assessment, the Company determines the amount of foreign earnings, if any, that it intends to repatriate to help fund its domestic cash needs, including for the Company's debt service obligations, and pays applicable U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes, if any, on such earnings to the extent repatriated, and otherwise records a tax liability for the estimated cost of repatriation in a future period. The Company believes that the cash generated by its domestic operations and availability under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and other permitted lines of credit should be sufficient to meet its domestic liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months. Therefore, the Company currently anticipates that restrictions and/or taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings will not have a material effect on the Company's liquidity during such period.\nChanges in Cash Flows\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $186.8 million, compared with $326.9 million at December 31, 2015. The following table summarizes the Company's cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities in 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>155.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>174.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(1,087.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(83.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(52.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>835.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(75.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>(2.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $114.2 million, $155.3 million and $174.0 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in cash used in 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily driven by the payment of acquisition and integration costs in 2016, higher interest payments in 2016 as a result of increased debt incurred in connection with the Elizabeth Arden acquisition, as well as the timing of certain accounts payable disbursements and accounts receivable collections at the end of 2015 compared to 2016. The decrease in cash from operating activities in 2015, as compared to 2014, was primarily driven by higher inventory and tax payments, partially offset by less cash used in discontinued operations, as well as lower payments for restructuring and interest in 2015 compared to 2014.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1,087.5 million, $83.8 million and $52.1 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which included $59.3 million, $48.3 million and $55.5 million of cash used for capital expenditures, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities in 2016 included $1,034.3 million in cash payments for the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition (partially offset by $41.1 million of cash acquired in the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition) and $29.1 million in cash payments for the May 2016 Cutex International Acquisition. Net cash used in investing activities in 2015 included $41.7 million in cash payments, net of cash acquired, primarily for the Company's April 2015 CBB Acquisition, partially offset by $6.2 million in cash proceeds from the sale of certain immaterial, non-core assets. Net cash used in investing activities in 2014 included cash used for capital expenditures, partially offset by $3.4 million in proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment, primarily related to other immaterial restructuring actions.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $835.8 million, $(12.1) million and $(75.1) million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nNet cash provided by financing activities in 2016 primarily included:\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>cash proceeds received in connection with the 2016 Term Loan Facility, in the aggregate principal amount of $1,800.0 million, or $1,791.0 million, net of discounts; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>cash proceeds received in connection with issuance of the 6.25% Senior Notes, in the aggregate principal amount of $450.0 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table> with the foregoing partially offset by:\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$658.6 million of cash used to repay all of the aggregate principal balance outstanding under Products Corporation's 2011 Term Loan;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td> $651.4 million of cash used to repay all of the aggregate principal balance outstanding under Products Corporation's Old Acquisition Term Loan;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>(i) $45.0 million of fees paid in connection with completing the 2016 Term Loan Facility; (ii) $5.7 million of fees paid in connection with completing the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility; and (iii) $10.9 million of fees paid in connection with issuing Products Corporation's 6.25% Senior Notes; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $23.2 million required excess cash flow prepayment made under the Old Term Loan Facility, as discussed below.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Net cash used in financing activities for 2015 primarily included:\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $24.6 million required excess cash flow prepayment made under the Old Term Loan Facility; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$6.8 million of scheduled amortization payments on the Old Acquisition Term Loan;\n</td> </tr>\n</table> with the foregoing partially offset by:\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$23.0 million increase in short-term borrowings and overdrafts.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Net cash used in financing activities for 2014 included:\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the repayment in May 2014 of the $58.4 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Non-Contributed Loan;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$7.0 million of scheduled amortization payments on the Old Acquisition Term Loan;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$4.7 million decrease in short-term borrowings and overdrafts; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the payment of $1.8 million of financing costs primarily related to a February 2014 amendment to the Old Term Loan Facility.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRefer below for further discussion of the debt instruments and related financing activities discussed above.\nLong-Term Debt Instruments\n(a) Recent Debt Transactions\nThe Company completed several debt transactions during 2016, 2015 and 2014:\n2016 Debt-Related Transactions\nIn connection with and substantially concurrently with the closing of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, Products Corporation entered into: (i) the 7-year $1,800.0 million 2016 Term Loan Facility; and (ii) the 5-year $400.0 million 2016 Revolving Credit Facility. Products Corporation also completed the issuance of $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.25% Senior Notes due 2024. The proceeds of Products Corporation's 6.25% Senior Notes offering and the 2016 Term Loan Facility, together with approximately $35.0 million of borrowings under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and approximately $126.7 million of cash on hand, were used: (A) to fund the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, including: (i) repurchasing the entire $350.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the then-existing Elizabeth Arden Senior Notes; (ii) repaying the entire $142.0 million aggregate principal amount of borrowings outstanding as of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date under Elizabeth Arden's $300.0 million revolving credit facility (which facility was terminated upon such repayment); (iii) repaying the entire $25.0 million aggregate principal amount of borrowings outstanding as of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date under Elizabeth Arden's second lien credit facility (which facility was terminated upon such repayment); and (iv) retiring the entire $55.0 million liquidation preference of all 50,000 shares of Elizabeth Arden's then-issued and outstanding preferred stock (which amount included a $5.0 million change of control premium); and (B) to completely refinance and repay all of the $651.4 million in aggregate principal balance outstanding under Products Corporation's then-existing 2011 Term Loan and all of the $658.6 million in aggregate principal balance outstanding under Products Corporation's Old Acquisition Term Loan (each of which facilities were terminated upon such repayment). The Company did not incur any material early termination penalties in connection with repaying the Old Term Loan Facility or the Elizabeth Arden indebtedness and preferred stock.\n2016 Term Loan Facility\nPrincipal and Maturity: On the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date, Products Corporation entered into the 2016 Term Loan Agreement, for which Citibank, N.A. acts as administrative and collateral agent and which has an initial aggregate principal amount of $1,800.0 million and matures on the earlier of: (x) the seventh anniversary of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date; and (y) the 91st day prior to the maturity of Products Corporation's 5.75% Senior Notes if, on that date (and solely for so long as), (i) any of Products Corporation's 5.75% Senior Notes remain outstanding and (ii) Products Corporation's available liquidity does not exceed the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding 5.75% Senior Notes by at least $200.0 million. The loans under the 2016 Term Loan Facility were borrowed at an original issue discount of 0.5% to their principal amount. The 2016 Term Loan Facility may be increased by an amount equal to the sum of (x) the greater of $450.0 million and 90% of Products Corporation's pro forma consolidated EBITDA, plus (y) an unlimited amount to the extent that (1) the first lien leverage ratio (defined as the ratio of Products Corporation's net senior secured funded debt that is not junior or subordinated to the liens of the Senior Facilities to EBITDA) is less than or equal to 3.5 to 1.0 (for debt secured pari passu with the 2016 Term Loan Facility) or (2) the secured leverage ratio (defined as the ratio of Products Corporation's net senior secured funded debt to EBITDA) is less than or equal to 4.25 to 1.0 (for junior lien or unsecured debt), plus (z) up to an additional $400.0 million if the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility has been repaid and terminated.\nGuarantees and Security: Products Corporation and the restricted subsidiaries under the 2016 Term Loan Facility, which include Products Corporation's domestic subsidiaries, including Elizabeth Arden and its domestic subsidiaries (collectively, the Restricted Group\u201d), are subject to the covenants under the 2016 Term Loan Agreement. The 2016 Term Loan Facility is guaranteed by each of Products Corporation's existing and future direct or indirect wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries (subject to various exceptions), as well as by Revlon, on a limited recourse basis. The obligations of Revlon, Products Corporation and the subsidiary guarantors under the 2016 Term Loan Facility are secured by pledges of the equity of Products Corporation held by Revlon and the equity of the Restricted Group held by Products Corporation and each subsidiary guarantor (subject to certain exceptions, including equity of first-tier foreign subsidiaries in excess of 65% of the voting equity interests of such entity) and by substantially all tangible and intangible personal and real property of Products Corporation and the subsidiary guarantors (subject to certain exclusions). The obligors and guarantors under the 2016 Term Loan Facility and the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility are identical. The liens securing the 2016 Term Loan Facility on the accounts, inventory, equipment, chattel paper, documents, instruments, deposit accounts, real estate and investment property and general intangibles (other than intellectual property) related thereto (the Revolving Facility Collateral\u201d) rank second in priority to the liens thereon securing the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility. The liens securing the 2016 Term Loan Facility on all other property, including capital stock, intellectual property and certain other intangible property (the Term Loan Collateral\u201d), rank first in priority to the liens thereon securing the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, while the liens thereon securing the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility rank second in priority to the liens thereon securing the 2016 Term Loan Facility.\nInterest and Fees: Interest accrues on term loans under the 2016 Term Loan Facility at a rate per annum of Adjusted LIBOR (which has a floor of 0.75%) plus a margin of 3.50% or an alternate base rate plus a margin of 2.50%, at Products Corporation's option, and is payable quarterly, at a minimum. Products Corporation is obligated to pay certain fees and expenses in connection with the 2016 Term Loan Facility.\nAffirmative and Negative Covenants: The 2016 Term Loan Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit the Restricted Group's ability to: (i) incur additional debt; (ii) incur liens; (iii) sell, transfer or dispose of assets; (iv) make investments; (v) make dividends and distributions on, or repurchases of, equity; (vi) make prepayments of contractually subordinated or junior lien debt; (vii) enter into certain transactions with their affiliates; (viii) enter into sale-leaseback transactions; (ix) change their lines of business; (x) restrict dividends from their subsidiaries or restrict liens; (xi) change their fiscal year; and (xii) modify the terms of certain debt. The negative covenants are subject to various exceptions, including an available amount basket\u201d based on 50% of Products Corporation's cumulative consolidated net income, plus a starter\u201d basket of $200.0 million, subject to Products Corporation's compliance with a 5.0 to 1.0 ratio of Products Corporation's net debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the 2016 Term Loan Agreement), except such compliance is not required when such baskets are used to make investments. While the 2016 Term Loan Agreement contains certain customary representations, warranties and events of default, it does not contain any financial maintenance covenants.\nPrepayments: The 2016 Term Loan Facility is subject to mandatory prepayments from: (i) the net proceeds from the issuance by Products Corporation or any of its restricted subsidiaries of certain additional debt; (ii) commencing with the excess cash flow calculation with respect to fiscal year ending December 31, 2017, 50% of excess cash flow, with step-downs to 25% and 0% upon achievement of certain first lien leverage ratios and reduced by voluntary prepayments of loans under the 2016 Term Loan Facility and revolving loans under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility to the extent commitments thereunder are permanently reduced; and (iii) asset sale proceeds of certain non-ordinary course asset sales or other dispositions of property that have not been reinvested to the extent in excess of certain minimum amounts. Products Corporation may voluntarily prepay the 2016 Term Loan Facility without premium or penalty unless Products Corporation prepays a term loan within six months after the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date in connection with a repricing transaction (in which case a 1.00% premium is payable).\n2016 Revolving Credit Facility\nPrincipal and Maturity: On the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date, Products Corporation entered into the 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement, for which Citibank, N.A. acts as administrative agent and collateral agent. The 2016 Revolving Credit Facility has an initial maximum availability of $400.0 million (with a $100.0 million sublimit for letters of credit and up to $70.0 million available for swing line loans), which availability is subject to the amount of the borrowing base. The 2016 Revolving Credit Facility may be increased by the greater of (x) $50.0 million and (y) the excess of the borrowing base over the amounts of then-effective commitments. The 2016 Revolving Credit Facility permits certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to borrow in local currencies. The borrowing base calculation under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility is based on the sum of: (i) 85% of eligible accounts receivable; (ii) the lesser of 85% of the net orderly liquidation value and a percentage of the value specified in respect of different types of eligible inventory; (iii) qualified restricted cash (capped at $75.0 million); and (iv) a temporary increase amount between August 15 and October 31 of each year, which are collectively subject to certain availability reserves set by the administrative agent. The 2016 Revolving Credit Facility matures on the earlier of: (x) the fifth anniversary of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date; and (y) the 91st day prior to the maturity of Products Corporation's 5.75% Senior Notes if, on that date (and solely for so long as), (i) any of Products Corporation's 5.75% Senior Notes remain outstanding and (ii) Products Corporation's available liquidity does not exceed the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding 5.75% Senior Notes by at least $200.0 million.\nGuarantees and Security: The Restricted Group under the 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement (which is the same as the Restricted Group under the 2016 Term Loan Agreement) is subject to the covenants under the 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement. The 2016 Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by each of Products Corporation's existing and future direct or indirect wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries (subject to various exceptions), as well as by Revlon on a limited recourse basis. The obligations of Revlon, Products Corporation and the subsidiary guarantors under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility are secured by pledges of the equity of Products Corporation held by Revlon and the equity of Products Corporation's restricted subsidiaries held by Products Corporation and each subsidiary guarantor (subject to certain exceptions, including equity of first-tier foreign subsidiaries in excess of 65% of the voting equity interests of such entity) and by substantially all tangible and intangible personal and real property of Products Corporation and the subsidiary guarantors (subject to certain exclusions). The obligors and guarantors under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and the 2016 Term Loan Facility are identical. The liens on the 2016 Revolving Facility Collateral securing the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility rank first in priority to the liens thereon securing the 2016 Term Loan Facility, which rank second in priority on such collateral. The liens on the Term Loan Collateral securing the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility rank second in priority to the liens thereon securing the 2016 Term Loan Facility, which rank first in priority on such collateral.\nInterest and Fees: Under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, interest is payable quarterly and accrues on borrowings under such facility at a rate per annum equal to either: (i) the alternate base rate plus an applicable margin equal to 0.25%, 0.50% or 0.75%, depending on the average excess availability (based on the borrowing base as most recently reported by Products Corporation to the administrative agent from time to time); or (ii) the Eurocurrency rate plus an applicable margin equal to 1.25%, 1.50% or 1.75%, depending on the average excess availability (based on the borrowing base as most recently reported by Products Corporation to the administrative agent from time to time), at Products Corporation's option. The applicable margin decreases as average excess availability under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility increases. Products Corporation is obligated to pay certain fees and expenses in connection with the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, including a commitment fee of 0.25% for any unused amounts. Loans under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility may be prepaid without premium or penalty.\nAffirmative and Negative Covenants: The 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants that are similar to those in the 2016 Term Loan Agreement, other than the available amount basket\u201d (as described above in the description of the 2016 Term Loan Facility); provided, however, under the 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement the Restricted Group will be able to incur unlimited additional junior secured debt and unsecured debt, make unlimited asset sales and dispositions, make unlimited investments and acquisitions, prepay junior debt and make unlimited restricted payments to the extent that certain payment conditions\u201d for asset-based credit facilities are satisfied. The 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations, warranties and events of default. If Products Corporation's Liquidity Amount\u201d (defined in the 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement as the Borrowing Base less the sum of (x) the aggregate outstanding extensions of credit under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, and (y) any availability reserve in effect on such date) falls below the greater of $35.0 million and 10% of the maximum availability under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility (a Liquidity Event Period\u201d), then the Restricted Group will be required to maintain a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (the ratio of Products Corporation's EBITDA minus capital expenditures to cash interest expense for such period) of a minimum of 1.0 to 1.0 until the first date after 20 consecutive business days for which the Liquidity Amount is equal to or greater than such threshold. If Products Corporation is in default under the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio under the 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement, Products Corporation may cure such default by Products Corporation and/or Revlon issuing certain equity securities and Products Corporation receiving capital contributions from Revlon, with such cash being deemed to increase EBITDA for the purpose of calculating the applicable ratio. Products Corporation may exercise this cure right no more than two times in any four-quarter period, and no more than five times in total during the term of the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility.\nPrepayments: Products Corporation must prepay borrowings under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility to the extent that outstanding loans and letters of credit exceed availability. During a Liquidity Event Period, the administrative agent may apply amounts collected in controlled accounts for the repayment of loans under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility. The above descriptions of the terms of the 2016 Term Loan Facility and the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and the related security and collateral agreements are qualified in their entirety by reference to such agreements, which are attached as exhibits to this Form 10-K.\n6.25% Senior Notes\nOn August 4, 2016, Revlon Escrow Corporation (the Escrow Issuer\u201d), which on such date was a wholly owned subsidiary of Products Corporation, completed the 6.25% Senior Notes Offering, pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (as amended, the Securities Act\u201d), of $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 6.25% Senior Notes. The 6.25% Senior Notes are unsecured and were issued by the Escrow Issuer to the initial purchasers under the 6.25% Senior Notes Indenture, between the Escrow Issuer and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the 6.25% Senior Notes Trustee\u201d). The 6.25% Senior Notes mature on August 1, 2024. Interest on the 6.25% Senior Notes accrues at 6.25% per annum, paid every six months through maturity on each February 1 and August 1, beginning on February 1, 2017. The proceeds from the 6.25% Senior Notes were released from escrow on the September 7, 2016 Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date (the \"Escrow Release\"). On the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date, the Escrow Issuer was merged with and into Products Corporation and in connection with the Escrow Release, Products Corporation and certain of its direct and indirect wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, including Elizabeth Arden and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the \"6.25% Senior Notes Guarantors\u201d), and the 6.25% Senior Notes Trustee entered into a supplemental indenture (the 6.25% Senior Notes Supplemental Indenture\u201d) to the 6.25% Senior Notes Indenture, pursuant to which Products Corporation assumed the obligations of the Escrow Issuer under the 6.25% Senior Notes and the 6.25% Senior Notes Indenture and the 6.25% Senior Notes Guarantors jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed the 6.25% Senior Notes on a senior unsecured basis (the \"6.25% Senior Notes Guarantees\"). The 6.25% Senior Notes Guarantors are the same entities that are subsidiary guarantors under the 2016 Senior Credit Facilities.\nIn December 2016, Products Corporation consummated an offer to exchange the original 6.25% Senior Notes for $450 million of new 6.25% Senior Notes, which have substantially the same terms as the original 6.25% Senior Notes, except that they are registered under the Securities Act (such registered new notes being the 6.25% Senior Notes\u201d).\nRanking: The 6.25% Senior Notes are Products Corporation's senior, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations, ranking: (i) pari passu in right of payment with all of Products Corporation's existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior in right of payment to all of Products Corporation's and the 6.25% Senior Notes Guarantors' future subordinated indebtedness; and (iii) effectively junior to all of Products Corporation's and the 6.25% Senior Notes Guarantors' existing and future senior secured indebtedness, including, indebtedness under Products Corporation's 2016 Senior Credit Facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The 6.25% Senior Notes and the 6.25% Senior Notes Guarantees are: (i) structurally subordinated to all of the liabilities and preferred stock of any of the Company's subsidiaries that do not guarantee the 6.25% Senior Notes; and (ii) pari passu in right of payment with liabilities of the 6.25% Senior Notes Guarantors other than expressly subordinated indebtedness. The 6.25% Senior Notes and the 6.25% Senior Notes Guarantees rank effectively junior to indebtedness and preferred stock of Products Corporation's foreign and immaterial subsidiaries (the 6.25% Senior Notes Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries\u201d), none of which guarantee the 6.25% Senior Notes.\nOptional Redemption: Prior to August 1, 2019, Products Corporation may redeem the 6.25% Senior Notes at its option, at any time as a whole or from time to time in part, upon Products Corporation's payment of an applicable make-whole premium based on the comparable treasury rate plus 50 basis points. Prior to August 1, 2019, up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of 6.25% Senior Notes may also be redeemed at Products Corporation's option at any time as a whole or from time to time in part, at a redemption price equal to 106.250% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but not including) the date of redemption with the proceeds of certain equity offerings and capital contributions (so long as at least 60% of the 6.25% Senior Notes thereafter remain outstanding). On and after August 1, 2019, Products Corporation may redeem the 6.25% Senior Notes at its option, at any time as a whole, or from time to time in part, at the following redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount), plus accrued interest to (but not including) the date of redemption, if redeemed during the 12-month period beginning on August 1 of the years indicated below:\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Optional Redemption Premium Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104.688\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103.125\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101.563\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022 and thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.000\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAll redemptions (and notices thereof) may be subject to various conditions precedent, and redemption dates specified in such notices may be extended so that such conditions precedent may be fulfilled (to the extent redemption on such dates is otherwise permitted by the 6.25% Senior Notes Indenture).\nChange of Control: Upon the occurrence of specified change of control events, Products Corporation is required to make an offer to purchase all of the 6.25% Senior Notes at a purchase price of 101% of the outstanding principal amount of the 6.25% Senior Notes as of the date of any such repurchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but not including) the date of repurchase.\nCertain Covenants: The 6.25% Senior Notes Indenture imposes certain limitations on Products Corporation's and the 6.25% Senior Notes Guarantors' ability, and the ability of certain other subsidiaries, to: (i) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock; (ii) pay dividends, make certain investments and make repayments on indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the 6.25% Senior Notes and make other restricted payments;\u201d (iii) create liens on their assets to secure debt; (iv) enter into transactions with affiliates; (v) merge, consolidate or amalgamate with another company; (vi) transfer and sell assets; and (vii) permit restrictions on the payment of dividends by Products Corporation's subsidiaries.\nThese covenants are subject to important qualifications and exceptions. The 6.25% Senior Notes Indenture also contains customary affirmative covenants and events of default. In addition, if during any period of time the 6.25% Senior Notes receive investment grade ratings from both Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Services, Inc. and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing under the 6.25% Senior Notes Indenture, Products Corporation and its subsidiaries will not be subject to the covenants regarding limitations on debt, limitations on restricted payments, limitation on guarantees by restricted subsidiaries, limitation on transactions with affiliates, certain provisions of the successor company covenant, limitation on asset sales and limitation on dividends from restricted subsidiaries.\nAmended Term Loan Facility - Excess Cash Flow Payment\nIn February 2016, Products Corporation prepaid $23.2 million of indebtedness, representing 50% of its 2015 excess cash flow\u201d as defined under, and as required by, the Old Term Loan Agreement. The prepayment was applied on a ratable basis between the principal amounts outstanding at such time under the 2011 Term Loan and the Old Acquisition Term Loan. The amount of the prepayment that was applied to the 2011 Term Loan reduced the principal amount outstanding by $11.5 million to $651.4 million (as all amortization payments under the 2011 Term Loan had been paid). The $11.7 million that was applied to the Old Acquisition Term Loan reduced Products Corporation's future annual amortization payments under such loan on a ratable basis from $6.9 million prior to the prepayment to $6.8 million after giving effect to the prepayment. The 2011 Term Loan and Old Acquisition Term Loan were completely refinanced and terminated in connection with Products Corporation's completing the 2016 Senior Credit Facilities and issuing the 6.25% Senior Notes.\n2015 Debt Related Transaction\nAmended Term Loan Facility - Excess Cash Flow Payment\nIn March 2015, Products Corporation prepaid $24.6 million of indebtedness, representing 50% of its 2014 excess cash flow,\u201d in accordance with the terms of its Old Term Loan Facility. The prepayment was applied on a ratable basis between the principal amounts outstanding under the 2011 Term Loan and the Old Acquisition Term Loan. The amount of the prepayment applied to the 2011 Term Loan reduced the principal amount outstanding at such time by $12.1 million to $662.9 million (as all amortization payments under the 2011 Term Loan had been paid). The $12.5 million applied to the Old Acquisition Term Loan reduced Products Corporation's future regularly scheduled quarterly amortization payments under such loan on a ratable basis from $1.8 million prior to the prepayment to $1.7 million after giving effect to the prepayment. The 2011 Term Loan and Old Acquisition Term Loan were completely refinanced and terminated in connection with Products Corporation's completing the 2016 Senior Credit Facilities and issuing the 6.25% Senior Notes.\n2014 Debt Related Transactions\nFebruary 2014 Term Loan Amendment\nIn February 2014, Products Corporation entered into an amendment (the February 2014 Term Loan Amendment\u201d) to its Old Term Loan Agreement among Products Corporation, as borrower, a syndicate of lenders and Citicorp USA, Inc. ( CUSA\u201d), as administrative agent and collateral agent.\nPursuant to the February 2014 Term Loan Amendment, the interest rates applicable to Eurodollar Loans under the 2011 Term Loan bore interest at the Eurodollar Rate plus 2.5% per annum, with the Eurodollar Rate not to be less than 0.75% (compared to 3.0% and 1.0%, respectively, prior to the February 2014 Term Loan Amendment), while Alternate Base Rate Loans under the 2011 Term Loan bore interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus 1.5%, with the Alternate Base Rate not to be less than 1.75% (compared to 2.0% in each case prior to the February 2014 Term Loan Amendment) (and as each such term is defined in the Old Term Loan Agreement).\nProducts Corporation's Old Acquisition Term Loan and Old Revolving Credit Facility were not amended in connection with the February 2014 Term Loan Amendment. The 2011 Term Loan, the Old Acquisition Term Loan and the Old Revolving Credit Facility were completely refinanced and terminated in connection with Products Corporation's completing the 2016 Senior Credit Facilities and issuing the 6.25% Senior Notes.\nDuring 2014, the Company incurred approximately $1.1 million of fees and expenses in connection with the February 2014 Term Loan Amendment, which were expensed as incurred, and wrote-off $0.8 million of unamortized debt discount and deferred financing costs as a result of the February 2014 Term Loan Amendment. These amounts, totaling $1.9 million, were recognized within loss on the early extinguishment of debt in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nRepayment of Non-Contributed Loan\nIn May 2014, Products Corporation used available cash on hand to optionally prepay in full the remaining $58.4 million principal amount then outstanding under the Non-Contributed Loan, which would have otherwise matured on October 8, 2014. In connection with such prepayment, the Company wrote-off $0.1 million of deferred financing costs, which were recognized within loss on early extinguishment of debt in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income for 2014.\n5.75% Senior Notes\nIn February 2013, Products Corporation completed its offering (the \"2013 Senior Notes Refinancing\"), pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act,) of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 5.75% Senior Notes. The 5.75% Senior Notes are unsecured and were issued under the 5.75% Senior Notes Indenture to investors at par. The 5.75% Senior Notes mature on February 15, 2021. Interest on the 5.75% Senior Notes accrues at 5.75% per annum, paid every six months on February 15th and August 15th. The 5.75% Senior Notes were issued pursuant to the 5.75% Senior Notes Indenture, dated as of February 8, 2013 (the 5.75% Senior Notes Closing Date\u201d), by and among Products Corporation, Products Corporation's domestic subsidiaries (the 5.75% Senior Notes Guarantors\u201d), which also currently guarantee Products Corporation's 2016 Senior Credit Facilities and 6.25% Senior Notes, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the \"5.75% Senior Notes Trustee\"). The 5.75% Senior Notes Guarantors issued guarantees (the 5.75% Senior Notes Guarantees\u201d) of Products Corporation's obligations under the 5.75% Senior Notes and the 5.75% Senior Notes Indenture on a joint and several, senior unsecured basis.\nIn December 2013, Products Corporation consummated an offer to exchange the original 5.75% Senior Notes for $500 million of new 5.75% Senior Notes, which have substantially the same terms as the original 5.75% Senior Notes, except that they are registered under the Securities Act (such registered new notes being the 5.75% Senior Notes\u201d).\nProducts Corporation used a portion of the $491.2 million of net proceeds from the issuance of the 5.75% Senior Notes (net of underwriters' fees) to repay and redeem all of the $330.0 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of its 9.75% Senior Secured Notes, as well as to pay $8.6 million of accrued interest. Products Corporation incurred an aggregate of $19.4 million of fees for the applicable redemption and tender offer premiums, related fees and expenses in connection with redemption and repayment of the 9.75% Senior Secured Notes and other fees and expenses in connection with the issuance of the 5.75% Senior Notes. Products Corporation used a portion of the remaining proceeds from the issuance of the 5.75% Senior Notes, together with existing cash, to pay approximately $113.0 million of principal on its 2011 Term Loan. Products Corporation used the remaining balance available from the issuance of the 5.75% Senior Notes for general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, debt reduction transactions, such as repaying a loan to Revlon at its maturity on October 8, 2013, which proceeds Revlon used to pay the liquidation preference of Revlon's then outstanding Series A Preferred Stock in connection with its mandatory redemption on such date.\nRanking\nThe 5.75% Senior Notes are Products Corporation's unsubordinated, unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any future subordinated obligations of Products Corporation and rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior debt of Products Corporation. Similarly, each 5.75% Senior Notes Guarantee is the relevant 5.75% Senior Notes Guarantor's joint and several, unsubordinated and unsecured obligation, ranking senior in right of payment to any future subordinated obligations of such 5.75% Senior Notes Guarantor and ranking pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior debt of such 5.75% Senior Notes Guarantor. The 5.75% Senior Notes Guarantees were issued on a joint and several basis.\nThe 5.75% Senior Notes and the 5.75% Senior Notes Guarantees rank effectively junior to Products Corporation's 2016 Senior Credit Facilities, which are secured, as well as indebtedness and preferred stock of Products Corporation's foreign and immaterial subsidiaries (the 5.75% Senior Notes Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries and together with the 6.25% Senior Notes Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, the \"Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries\u201d), none of which guarantee the 5.75% Senior Notes.\nOptional Redemption\nThe 5.75% Senior Notes may be redeemed at Products Corporation's option, at any time as a whole, or from time to time in part, at the following redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount), plus accrued interest to the date of redemption, if redeemed during the 12-month period beginning on February 15th of the years indicated below:\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102.875\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101.438\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019 and thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.000\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nChange of Control\nUpon the occurrence of specified change of control events, Products Corporation is required to make an offer to purchase all of the 5.75% Senior Notes at a purchase price of 101% of the outstanding principal amount of the 5.75% Senior Notes as of the date of any such repurchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase.\nCertain Covenants\nThe 5.75% Senior Notes Indenture limits Products Corporation's and the 5.75% Senior Notes Guarantors' ability, and the ability of certain other subsidiaries, to:\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>incur or guarantee additional indebtedness ( Limitation on Debt\u201d);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>pay dividends, make repayments on indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the 5.75% Senior Notes and make other restricted payments\u201d ( Limitation on Restricted Payments\u201d);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>make certain investments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>create liens on their assets to secure debt;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>enter into transactions with affiliates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>merge, consolidate or amalgamate with another company ( Successor Company\u201d);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>transfer and sell assets ( Limitation on Asset Sales\u201d); and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>permit restrictions on the payment of dividends by Products Corporation's subsidiaries ( Limitation on Dividends from Subsidiaries\u201d).\n</td> </tr>\n</table> These covenants are subject to important qualifications and exceptions. The 5.75% Senior Notes Indenture also contains customary affirmative covenants and events of default.\nIn addition, if during any period of time the 5.75% Senior Notes receive investment grade ratings from both Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Services, Inc. and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing under the 5.75% Senior Notes Indenture, Products Corporation and its subsidiaries will not be subject to the covenants on Limitation on Debt, Limitation on Restricted Payments, Limitation on Asset Sales, Limitation on Dividends from Subsidiaries and certain provisions of the Successor Company covenant.\nCovenants\nProducts Corporation was in compliance with all applicable covenants under the 2016 Credit Agreements as of December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 2016 Term Loan Facility was $1,795.5 million and availability under the $400.0 million 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, based upon the calculated borrowing base of $389.2 million, less $10.4 million of outstanding undrawn letters of credit, and nil drawn on the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, was $378.8 million.\nProducts Corporation was in compliance with all applicable covenants under its Senior Notes Indentures as of December 31, 2016.\nSources and Uses\nThe Company's principal sources of funds are expected to be operating revenues, cash on hand and funds available for borrowing under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and other permitted lines of credit. The 2016 Credit Agreements, and the Senior Notes Indentures contain certain provisions that by their terms limit Products Corporation's and its subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, incur additional debt.\nThe Company's principal uses of funds are expected to be the payment of operating expenses, including expenses in connection with the continued execution of the Company's business strategy; payments in connection with the Company's synergy and integration programs related to the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition (including, without limitation, for the EA Integration Restructuring Program); purchases of permanent wall displays; capital expenditure requirements; debt service payments and costs; cash tax payments; pension and other post-retirement benefit plan contributions; payments in connection with the Company's restructuring programs; business and/or brand acquisitions (including, without limitation, through licensing transactions), if any; severance not otherwise included in the Company's restructuring programs; debt and/or equity repurchases, if any; costs related to litigation; and payments in connection with discontinuing non-core business lines and/or exiting and/or entering certain territories and/or channels of trade. The Company's cash contributions to its pension and post-retirement benefit plans in 2016 were $8.3 million. The Company expects cash contributions to its pension and post-retirement benefit plans to be approximately $8 million in the aggregate for 2017. The Company's cash taxes paid in 2016 were $21.9 million. The Company expects to pay cash taxes of approximately $21 million in the aggregate during 2017. The Company's purchases of permanent wall displays and capital expenditures in 2016 were $52.1 million and $59.3 million, respectively. The Company expects purchases of permanent wall displays to be approximately $65.0 million during 2017 and expects capital expenditures to be approximately $100.0 million to $120 million in 2017. Capital expenditures for 2017 include Revlon and Elizabeth Arden expected spend, as well as approximately $40 million expected for the Elizabeth Arden Integration Program.\nAs a result of the EA Integration Restructuring Program, as well as other actions that the Company is continuing to evaluate related to integrating the Elizabeth Arden organization into the Company's business, such as through the elimination of duplicative functions, leveraging purchasing scale and optimizing the manufacturing and distribution networks of the combined company, the Company currently expects to realize over a multi-year period annualized synergies and cost reductions of approximately $190 million. In order to capture these annualized cost reductions, the Company anticipates that it will incur, over a multi-year period, approximately $100 million to $110 million of integration-related capital expenditures and approximately $70 million to $80 million of non-restructuring integration costs. Any of these actions, the intended purpose of which would be to create value through improving the Company's financial performance, could result in the Company making investments and/or recognizing charges related to executing against such opportunities. Any such activities may be funded with cash on hand, funds available under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and/or other permitted additional sources of capital, which actions could increase the Company's total debt.\nThe Company has undertaken, and continues to assess, refine and implement, a number of programs to efficiently manage its working capital, including, among other things, initiatives intended to optimize inventory levels over time; centralized procurement to secure discounts and efficiencies; prudent management of trade receivables and accounts payable; and controls on general and administrative spending. In the ordinary course of business, the Company's source or use of cash from operating activities may vary on a quarterly basis as a result of a number of factors, including the timing of working capital flows.\nContinuing to execute the Company's business strategy could include taking advantage of additional opportunities to reposition, repackage or reformulate one or more brands or product lines, launching additional new products, acquiring businesses or brands (including, without limitation, through licensing transactions), divesting or discontinuing non-core business lines (which may include exiting certain territories), further refining the Company's approach to retail merchandising and/or taking further actions to optimize its manufacturing, sourcing and organizational size and structure, including optimizing the Colomer Acquisition, the CBB Acquisition, the Cutex International Acquisition and/or the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition. Any of these actions, the intended purpose of which would be to create value through improving the Company's financial performance, could result in the Company making investments and/or recognizing charges related to executing against such opportunities. Any such activities may be funded with cash on hand, funds available under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and/or other permitted additional sources of capital, which actions could increase the Company's total debt.\nThe Company may also, from time to time, seek to retire or purchase its outstanding debt obligations and/or advance funds to Revlon to repurchase its equity in open market purchases, block trades, privately negotiated purchase transactions or otherwise and may seek to refinance some or all of its indebtedness based upon market conditions. Any such retirement or purchase of debt and/or equity may be funded with operating cash flows of the business or other sources and will depend upon prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors, and the amounts involved may be material.\nThe Company expects that operating revenues, cash on hand and funds available for borrowing under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and other permitted lines of credit will be sufficient to enable the Company to pay its operating expenses for 2017, including expenses in connection with the execution of the Company's business strategy, payments in connection with the Company's synergy and integration programs related to the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, purchases of permanent wall displays, capital expenditure requirements, debt service payments and costs, cash tax payments, pension and other post-retirement plan contributions, payments in connection with the Company's restructuring programs, business and/or brand acquisitions (including, without limitation, through licensing transactions), if any, severance not otherwise included in the Company's restructuring programs, debt and/or equity repurchases, if any, costs related to litigation, discontinuing non-core business lines and/or entering and/or exiting certain territories and/or channels of trade.\nThere can be no assurance that available funds will be sufficient to meet the Company's cash requirements on a consolidated basis. If the Company's anticipated level of revenues is not achieved because of, among other things, decreased consumer spending in response to weak economic conditions or weakness in the consumption of beauty care products in one or more of the Consumer, Elizabeth Arden, Professional and/or Other segments; adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, foreign currency controls and/or government-mandated pricing controls; decreased sales of the Company's products as a result of increased competitive activities by the Company's competitors and/or decreased performance by third party suppliers; changes in consumer purchasing habits, including with respect to retailer preferences and/or sales channels; inventory management by the Company's customers; space reconfigurations or reductions in display space by the Company's customers; changes in pricing, marketing, advertising and/or promotional strategies by the Company's customers; or less than anticipated results from the Company's existing or new products or from its advertising, promotional, pricing and/or marketing plans; or if the Company's expenses, including, without limitation, for synergy and integration programs related to the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, restructuring costs, acquisition and integration costs, costs related to litigation, advertising, promotional and marketing activities or for sales returns related to any reduction of space by the Company's customers, product discontinuances or otherwise, exceed the anticipated level of expenses, the Company's current sources of funds may be insufficient to meet the Company's cash requirements.\nAny such developments, if significant, could reduce the Company's revenues and operating income and could adversely affect Products Corporation's ability to comply with certain financial and/or other covenants under the 2016 Credit Agreements and/or the Senior Notes Indentures and in such event the Company could be required to take measures, including, among other things, reducing discretionary spending. (See Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" for further discussion of certain risks associated with the Company's business and indebtedness.)\nSpanish Government Loan\nIn connection with the Colomer Acquisition, the Company acquired the Colomer Group's euro-denominated loan payable to the Spanish government (the \"Spanish Government Loan\"), which loan had $0.5 million aggregate principal amount outstanding as of December 31, 2016 (based on foreign exchange rates in effect as of such date). The Spanish Government Loan does not bear interest and is payable in 10 equal installments on June 30th of each year beginning in 2016 through 2025.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nForeign Currency Forward Exchange Contracts\nProducts Corporation enters into FX Contracts and option contracts from time to time to hedge certain net cash flows denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of the Company's foreign and domestic operations. The FX Contracts are entered into primarily for the purpose of hedging anticipated inventory purchases and certain intercompany payments denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of the Company's foreign and domestic operations and generally have maturities of less than one year. At December 31, 2016, the FX Contracts outstanding had a notional amount of $79.6 million and a net asset fair value of $1.2 million.\nInterest Rate Swap Transaction\nIn November 2013, Products Corporation executed a forward-starting floating-to-fixed interest rate swap transaction that, at its inception, was based on a notional amount of $400 million in respect of indebtedness under the Old Acquisition Term Loan over a period of three years (the \"2013 Interest Rate Swap\"). The 2013 Interest Rate Swap initially had a floor of 1% that in December 2016 was amended to 0.75%. In connection with entering into the 2016 Term Loan Facility, the 2013 Interest Swap was carried over to apply to a notional amount of $400 million in respect of indebtedness under such loan for the remaining balance of the term of such swap. The Company initially designated the 2013 Interest Rate Swap as a cash flow hedge of the variability of the forecasted three-month LIBOR interest rate payments related to the $400 million notional amount under the Old Acquisition Term Loan over the three-year term of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap (and subsequently to the $400 million notional amount under the 2016 Term Loan Facility for the remaining balance of the term of such swap). Commencing in May 2015, Products Corporation receives from the counterparty a floating interest rate based on the higher of three-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR or the floor percentage in effect, while paying a fixed interest rate payment to the counterparty equal to 2.0709% (which, with respect to the 2016 Term Loan Facility, effectively fixes the interest rate on such notional amount at 5.5709% over the remaining balance of the three-year term of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap). At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the fair value of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap was a liability of $4.7 million and $6.5 million, respectively.\nAs a result of completely refinancing the Old Acquisition Term Loan with a portion of the proceeds from Products Corporation's consummation of the 2016 Senior Credit Facilities and the 6.25% Senior Notes Offering in connection with consummating the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, the critical terms of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap no longer match the terms of the underlying debt under the 2016 Term Loan Facility. At the refinancing date, or the September 7, 2016 Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date (the \"De-designation Date\"), the 2013 Interest Rate Swap was determined to no longer be highly effective and the Company discontinued hedge accounting for the 2013 Interest Rate Swap. Following the de-designation of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap, changes in fair value will be accounted for as a component of other non-operating expenses. Accumulated deferred losses of $4.9 million, or $3.0 million net of tax, at December 31, 2016 that were previously recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss will be amortized into earnings over the remaining term of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap through its maturity.\nCredit Risk\nExposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to the gross fair value of the derivative instruments in asset positions, which totaled $2.3 million and $2.0 million as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company attempts to minimize exposure to credit risk by generally entering into derivative contracts with counterparties that have investment-grade credit ratings and are major financial institutions. The Company also periodically monitors any changes in the credit ratings of its counterparties. Given the current credit standing of the counterparties to the Company's derivative instruments, the Company believes the risk of loss arising from any non-performance by any of the counterparties under these derivative instruments is remote.\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nDisclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table aggregates all contractual obligations and commercial commitments that affect the Company's financial condition and liquidity position as of December 31, 2016:\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n(dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt, including current portion (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,746.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>536.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,155.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on long-term debt (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>865.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>141.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>268.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>248.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>207.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>216.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>287.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>252.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term obligations (e)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,196.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>501.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>410.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>843.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,440.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Consists primarily of (i) the $1,795.5 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 2016 Term Loan Facility as of December 31, 2016; (ii) the $450.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 6.25% Senior Notes as of December 31, 2016; and (iii) the $500.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 5.75% Senior Notes as of December 31, 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(b)\n</td> <td>Consists of interest through the respective maturity dates on the outstanding debt discussed in (a) above; based on interest rates under such debt agreements as of December 31, 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(c)\n</td> <td>Included in the obligations for operating leases as of December 31, 2016 is the lease for the Company's headquarters in New York City, which includes minimum lease payments in the aggregate of approximately $70 million over the 15-year term; a leased distribution and office facility in Roanoke, Virginia; and a leased warehouse and returns processing facility in Salem, Virginia.

Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions. The Company believes that the following discussion addresses the Company's most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations and require management's\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nmost difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts:\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on historical experience and ongoing evaluations of the Company's receivables and evaluations of the risks of payment. The allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against trade receivable balances when they are deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of trade receivables previously reserved are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income when received.\nSales Returns:\nThe Company allows customers, primarily within its Consumer and Elizabeth Arden segment, to return their unsold products when they meet certain company-established criteria as outlined in the Company's trade terms. The Company regularly reviews and revises, when deemed necessary, the Company's estimates of sales returns based primarily upon historical product returns experience, planned product discontinuances and promotional sales, which would permit customers to return products based upon the Company's trade terms. The Company records estimated sales returns as a reduction to sales and cost of sales, and an increase in accrued liabilities and inventories.\nReturned products, which are recorded as inventories, are valued based upon the amount that the Company expects to realize upon their subsequent disposition. The physical condition and marketability of the returned products are the major factors the Company considers in estimating realizable value. Cost of sales includes the cost of refurbishment of returned products. Actual returns, as well as realized values on returned products, may differ significantly, either favorably or unfavorably, from the Company's estimates if factors such as product discontinuances, customer inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from the Company's estimates and expectations and, in the case of actual product returns, if economic conditions differ significantly from the Company's estimates and expectations.\nTrade Support Costs:\nIn order to support the retail trade, the Company has various performance-based arrangements with retailers to reimburse them for all or a portion of their promotional activities related to the Company's products. The Company regularly reviews and revises, when deemed necessary, estimates of costs to the Company for these promotions based on estimates of what has been incurred by the retailers. Actual costs incurred by the Company may differ significantly if factors such as the level and success of the retailers' programs, as well as retailer participation levels, differ from the Company's estimates and expectations.\nInventories:\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is based on standard cost and production variances, which approximates actual cost on the first-in, first-out method. Cost components include direct materials, direct labor and direct overhead, as well as in-bound freight. The Company records adjustments to the value of inventory based upon its forecasted plans to sell its inventories, as well as planned discontinuances. The physical condition (e.g., age and quality) of the inventories is also considered in establishing its valuation. These adjustments are estimates, which could vary significantly, either favorably or unfavorably, from the amounts that the Company may ultimately realize upon the disposition of inventories if future economic conditions, customer inventory levels, product discontinuances, sales return levels or competitive conditions differ from the Company's estimates and expectations.\nPension Benefits:\nThe Company sponsors both funded and unfunded pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering employees who meet the applicable eligibility requirements. The Company uses several statistical and other factors in an attempt to estimate future events in calculating the liability and net periodic benefit income/cost related to these plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected long-term return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined annually by the Company, within certain guidelines, which assumptions would be subject to revisions if significant events occur during the year. The Company uses December 31st as its measurement date for defined benefit pension plan obligations and plan assets.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company adopted an alternative approach to calculating the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other post-retirement benefits, the full yield curve\u201d approach. Under this method, the discount rate assumption was built through the application of specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows for each of the Company's pension and other retirement plans. Prior to December 31, 2015, the Company estimated the service and interest cost components utilizing a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. This change does not affect the measurement of the Company's total benefit obligations, as the change in service and interest costs is exactly offset in the actuarial loss (gain) recognized for each year. The Company made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates.\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nThe change has been accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is inseparable from a change in accounting principle, and accordingly, has been accounted for prospectively.\nThe Company utilized a 3.92% weighted average discount rate in 2016 for the Company's U.S. defined benefit pension plans, compared to a 4.15% weighted average discount rate in 2015. The Company utilized a 2.66% weighted average discount rate for the Company's international defined benefit pension plans in 2016, compared to a 3.68% weighted average discount rate selected in 2015. The discount rates are used to measure the benefit obligations at the measurement date and the net periodic benefit income/cost for the subsequent calendar year and are reset annually using data available at the measurement date. The changes in the discount rates used for 2016 were primarily due to observed decreases in long-term interest yields on high-quality corporate bonds during 2016. At December 31, 2016, the decrease in the discount rates from December 31, 2015 had the effect of increasing the Company's projected pension benefit obligation by approximately $24.3 million.\nIn selecting its expected long-term rate of return on its plan assets, the Company considers a number of factors, including, without limitation, recent and historical performance of plan assets, the plan portfolios' asset allocations over a variety of time periods compared with third-party studies, the performance of the capital markets in recent years and other factors, as well as advice from various third parties, such as the plans' advisors, investment managers and actuaries. While the Company considered both the recent performance and the historical performance of plan assets, the Company's assumptions are based primarily on its estimates of long-term, prospective rates of return. The difference between actual and expected return on plan assets is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income and the resulting gains or losses are amortized over future periods as a component of the net periodic benefit cost. For the Company's U.S. defined benefit pension plans, the expected long-term rate of return on the pension plan assets used was 7.00% for 2016 and 7.50% for 2015. The weighted average expected long-term rate of return used for the Company's international plans was 6.00% for both 2016 and 2015. For 2016, the actual return on pension plan assets was $35.8 million, as compared with expected return on plan assets of $31.0 million. The resulting $4.8 million difference (a net deferred gain), when combined with gains and losses from previous years, will be amortized over periods ranging from approximately 10 to 30 years. The actual return on plan assets for 2016 was above expectations, primarily due to higher returns from investments in developed equity markets, bank loans and bond yields.\nThe table below reflects the Company's estimates of the possible effects that changes in the discount rates and expected long-term rates of return would have had on its 2016 net periodic benefit costs and its projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2016 for the Company's principal defined benefit pension plans, with all other assumptions remaining constant:\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effect of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effect of\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25 basis points increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25 basis points decrease\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net periodic benefit costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Projected pension benefit obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net periodic benefit costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Projected pension benefit obligation\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(16.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected long-term rate of return\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe rate of future compensation increases is another assumption used by the Company's third party actuarial consultants for pension accounting. The rate of future compensation increases used for the Company's projected pension benefit obligation in 2016 and 2015 was 3.50% for the U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Such increase was not applied to the Revlon Employees' Retirement Plan and the Revlon Pension Equalization Plan, as the rate of future compensation increases is no longer relevant to such plans due to plan amendments which effectively froze these plans as of December 31, 2009.\nIn addition, the Company's actuarial consultants also use other factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used by the Company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants, among other things. Differences from these assumptions could significantly impact the actual amount of net periodic benefit cost and liability recorded by the Company.\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nTo determine the fiscal 2017 net periodic benefit income/cost, the Company is using the \"full yield curve approach\" described above to separately calculate discount rates for each of the service and interest components. The following table represents the weighted average discount rates used in calculating each component of service and interest costs for the Company's U.S. and international defined benefit pension plans:\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>U.S.\nPlans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>International\nPlans\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest cost on projected benefit obligation\n</td> <td>3.23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service cost\n</td> <td>4.53\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.69\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest cost on service cost\n</td> <td>4.07\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.51\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2017, the Company is using long-term rates of return on pension plan assets of 6.50% and 5.56% for its U.S. and international defined benefit pension plans, respectively. The Company expects that the impact of the changes in discount rates and the return on plan assets in 2017 will result in net periodic benefit income of $0.2 million for 2017, compared to $0.6 million of net periodic benefit income in 2016.\nGoodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets:\nIn determining the fair values of net assets acquired, including trade names, customer relationships and other intangible assets, and resulting goodwill related to the Company's business acquisitions, the Company considers, among other factors, the analyses of historical financial performance and an estimate of the future performance of the acquired business. The fair values of the acquired intangible assets are primarily calculated using a discounted cash flow approach.\nDetermining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions based on evaluating a number of factors, such as marketplace participants, product life cycles, consumer awareness, brand history and future expansion expectations. There are significant judgments inherent in a discounted cash flow approach, including in selecting appropriate discount rates, hypothetical royalty rates, contributory asset capital charges, estimating the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and identifying appropriate terminal growth rate assumptions. The discount rates used in discounted cash flow analyses are intended to reflect the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows generated by the respective acquired intangible assets.\nDetermining an acquired intangible asset's useful life requires management judgment and is based on evaluating a number of factors, including the expected use of the asset, consumer awareness, trade name history and future expansion expectations, as well as any contractual provisions that could limit or extend an asset's useful life. The Company believes that an acquired trade name has an indefinite life if it has a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance, and the Company has the intent and ability to support the trade name with marketplace spending for the foreseeable future. If this indefinite-lived criteria is not met, acquired trade names are amortized over their expected useful lives, which generally range from 5 to 20 years.\nGoodwill totaled $689.5 million and $469.7 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, goodwill of $227.5 million, $240.3 million, $221.7 million and nil (see \"Non-cash Impairment Charges\") related to the Consumer, Professional, Elizabeth Arden and Other segments, respectively. Indefinite-lived intangibles totaled $243.3 million and $95.0 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but rather are reviewed annually for impairment using October 1st carrying values, or when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the current carrying amounts may not be recovered. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to any such excess. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company establishes its reporting units based on its current reporting structure, product characteristics and management. Within the Consumer segment, the Company has identified two reporting units: (i) \"Global Color Brands,\" which include the SinfulColors and Pure Ice nail enamel brands; and (ii) \"Revlon, Almay and Other,\" which includes the remainder of the Company's Consumer brands and does not include brands of the Company's Elizabeth Arden and Other reportable segments. The Company's other reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in Note 18, Segment Data and Related Information.\u201d For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to each reporting unit to the extent that goodwill relates to each reporting unit.\nFor 2016, in assessing whether goodwill was impaired in connection with its annual impairment test performed during the fourth quarter of 2016 using October 1st carrying values, the Company performed qualitative assessments to determine whether it would be necessary to perform the two-step process, as prescribed by Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, to assess the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets for indicators of impairment. In performing the qualitative assessments, the Company considered the results of the step one test performed in 2015 and the financial performance of the Revlon, Almay and Other and Professional reporting units. Based upon such assessment, the Company determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of the Company's reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their carrying amounts for such reporting units.\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nThe Company determined that it would utilize the two-step process to test the Global Color Brands and Other reporting units for impairment. In the first step of this test, the Company compared the fair value of each of the Company's Global Color Brands and Other reporting units, determined based upon discounted estimated future cash flows, to the carrying amount of each reporting unit, including goodwill. Where the fair values of such reporting units exceeded the carrying amount, no further work was required and no impairment loss was indicated. The results of the step one test indicated that impairment indicators may have existed for the Company's Other reporting unit due to the termination of certain fragrance licenses that were not replaced, and accordingly, the Company performed step two of the goodwill impairment test for this reporting unit.\nIn the second step, the Company measured the potential impairment of its Other reporting unit by comparing the implied fair value of the Other reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of its goodwill at October 1, 2016. The implied fair value of the Other reporting unit's goodwill was determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination, where the estimated fair value of the Other reporting unit was allocated to all the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit (including both recognized and unrecognized intangible assets) as if the Other reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the estimated fair value of the Other reporting unit was the purchase price paid. When the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of that reporting unit's goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized within operations. The Company determined the fair value of the Other reporting unit using discounted estimated future cash flows. The weighted average cost of capital used in testing the Other reporting unit for impairment was 23.0% with a perpetual growth rate of 2.0%. As a result of this annual impairment test, the Company recognized an aggregate $16.7 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to the Other reporting unit in the fourth quarter of 2016. Following the recognition of this non-cash goodwill impairment charge, the Other reporting unit had no remaining goodwill as of December 31, 2016.\nIn conjunction with the annual impairment test, the Company reviews finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be fully recoverable. This test compares the current carrying values of the intangible assets to the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets. Based upon the results of the annual goodwill impairment test for the Other reporting unit during 2016, the Company performed an impairment review of the finite-lived intangible assets acquired as part of the 2015 CBB Acquisition. As a result of this review, the Company recognized during the fourth quarter of 2016 within the Other reporting unit $4.2 million, $2.0 million and $0.5 million of non-cash impairment charges as a result of the change in the fair value of customer relationships, distribution rights and trade names, respectively, in the aggregate amount of $6.7 million. For the year ended December 31, 2016, no impairment was recognized related to the carrying value of any other finite or indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nAs of the date of the Company's latest impairment testing, the fair values of the Global Color Brands reporting unit exceeded its carrying values by approximately $17 million. As of December 31, 2016, there were no significant events since the timing of the Company's annual impairment test that would have triggered additional impairment testing.\nFor 2015, the Company utilized the two-step process in assessing whether goodwill was impaired for each of the Company's four reporting units. As a result of the 2015 annual impairment test, the Company recognized a $9.7 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to the Global Color Brands reporting unit in the fourth quarter of 2015. For 2014, the Company performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether it would be necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test and to assess the Company's indefinite lived intangible assets for indicators of impairment, and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the Company's reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their carrying amounts. The Company did not record any impairment of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nSee Note 2, Business Combinations,\u201d and Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net,\u201d for further discussion of the Company's goodwill and intangible assets.\nIncome Taxes:\nThe Company records income taxes based on amounts payable with respect to the current year and includes the effect of deferred taxes. The effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates, tax-planning opportunities that may be available in various jurisdictions in which the Company operates, and the Company's estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues. Determining the Company's effective tax rate and evaluating tax positions requires significant judgment.\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which management expects that the Company will recover or settle those differences. The realization of the deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on forecasted future taxable income. The Company has established valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when management has determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize a tax benefit. Any reduction in estimated forecasted future taxable income may require the Company to record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets on which a valuation allowance was not previously established. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Provision for income taxes,\u201d for further discussion.\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nThe Company recognizes a tax position in its financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the merits of such position. The Company recognizes liabilities for unrecognized tax positions in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts is ultimately not required, the reversal of the liabilities would result in additional tax benefits recognized in the period in which the Company determines that the liabilities are no longer required. If the estimate of tax liabilities is ultimately less than the final assessment, this will result in a further charge to expense. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.\nThe Company provides for U.S. federal income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on foreign subsidiaries' cumulative undistributed earnings when it is not the Company's intent to indefinitely reinvest such earnings overseas. No provision is made for U.S. income taxes where the Company's plan is to indefinitely reinvest such undistributed earnings from the Company's foreign operations in its overseas operations. If these future foreign earnings are repatriated to the U.S., or if the Company determines that such foreign earnings will be remitted to the U.S. in the foreseeable future, additional U.S. tax provisions may be required.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,\" which requires deferred income tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent within a company's balance sheet. Under previous guidance, the Company was required to separate deferred income tax assets and liabilities into current and noncurrent amounts. Netting deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities by tax jurisdiction is still required under ASU 2015-17. The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-17 beginning on January 1, 2016 and the Company's previously recorded deferred tax assets were adjusted to reflect the adoption of ASU No. 2015-17. The adoption of ASU No. 2015-17 resulted in no adjustment to the Company's results of operations and stockholders' deficiency and had the following impact on the previously reported Consolidated Balance Sheet for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Balance Sheet\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total as reported at 12/31/2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Adjustment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total as adjusted at 12/31/2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Deferred income taxes - current\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(58.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Deferred income taxes - noncurrent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Other long-term liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(46.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total as reported at 12/31/2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Adjustment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total as adjusted at 12/31/2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Increase in prepaid expense and other current assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(32.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(25.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Increase in other, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total as reported at 12/31/2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Adjustment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total as adjusted at 12/31/2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Increase (decrease) in prepaid expense and other current assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Increase in other, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, \"Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement Period Adjustments,\" which eliminated the requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. Instead, acquirers must recognize measurement-period adjustments during the period in which they determine such adjustments, including the effect on earnings of any amounts they would have recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-16 beginning on January 1, 2016 and the adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and financial statement disclosures.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, \"Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,\" which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the financial statements as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability, consistent with\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nthe presentation of debt discounts. This guidance became effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted, and is applied retrospectively. The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-03 beginning on January 1, 2016 and the Company's previously recorded other assets and long-term debt were adjusted to reflect the adoption of ASU No. 2015-03. The adoption of ASU No. 2015-03 resulted in no adjustment to the Company's results of operations, cash flows and stockholders' deficiency and had the following impact on the previously reported Consolidated Balance Sheet for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015:\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Balance Sheet\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total as reported at 12/31/2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Adjustment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total as adjusted at 12/31/2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Long-Term Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,803.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(20.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,783.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Other Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, \"Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,\" that explicitly requires management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures if conditions give rise to substantial doubt. According to ASU No. 2014-15, substantial doubt exists if it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations within one year after the financial statement's issuance date. The likelihood threshold of \"probable,\" similar to its current use in U.S. GAAP for loss contingencies, is used to define substantial doubt. Disclosures are required under ASU No. 2014-15 if conditions give rise to substantial doubt, including whether and how management's plans will alleviate the substantial doubt. This guidance became effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption prohibited. The Company adopted ASU No. 2014-15 beginning January 1, 2016 and the adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and financial statement disclosures.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards or Updates Not Yet Effective\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,\u201d which simplifies the annual goodwill impairment analysis test by eliminating Step 2 of the current two-step impairment test. Under the new guidance, an entity would continue to perform the first step of the annual impairment test by comparing the carrying amount of a reporting unit with its fair value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, the goodwill impairment charge would be equal to the amount of such difference. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company expects to adopt ASU No. 2017-04 beginning as of January 1, 2020 and is in the process of assessing the impact that this new guidance is expected to have on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and/or financial statement disclosures.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash,\u201d which provides specific guidance on the presentation of changes in restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows. Under the new standard, the changes in restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents will be required to be disclosed in reconciling the opening and closing balances on the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company expects to adopt ASU No. 2016-18 beginning as of January 1, 2018 and is in the process of assessing the impact that this new guidance is expected to have on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and/or financial statement disclosures.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Receipts and Cash Payments,\u201d which aims to standardize how certain transactions are classified within the Statement of Cash Flows, including, among other issues, debt prepayment and extinguishment costs and contingent consideration payments made after a business combination. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company expects to adopt ASU No. 2016-15 beginning as of January 1, 2018 and is in the process of assessing the impact that this new guidance is expected to have on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and/or financial statement disclosures.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,\u201d which simplifies certain aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including transactions in which an employee uses shares to satisfy the employer's minimum statutory income tax withholding obligation, forfeitures and income taxes when awards vest or are settled. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU No. 2016-09 beginning as of January 1, 2017 and expects that this new guidance will not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and/or financial statement disclosures.\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, \"Leases (Topic 842),\" which requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a liability on the balance sheet for all leases, with the exception of short-term leases. The lease liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments and the right-of-use asset will be based on the lease liability, subject to adjustment such as for initial direct costs. Leases will continue to be classified as either operating or finance leases in the income statement. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company expects to adopt ASU No. 2016-02 beginning as of January 1, 2019 and is in the process of assessing the impact that this new guidance is expected to have on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and/or financial statement disclosures.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, \"Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,\" which simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventories by requiring inventory to be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value, rather than at the lower of cost or market. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-11 beginning as of January 1, 2017 and expects that this new guidance will not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and/or financial statement disclosures.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d. This new standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. The underlying principle of this new standard is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Entities may adopt this new standard either retrospectively for all periods presented in the financial statements (i.e., the full retrospective method) or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption (i.e., the modified retrospective method), without applying to comparative years' financial statements.\nIn August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date,\u201d which allows for a deferral of the adoption date for ASU No. 2014-09 until January 1, 2018 and permits early adoption of ASU No. 2014-09, but not before the effective date of January 1, 2017.\nThe Company plans to adopt ASU No. 2014-09 on January 1, 2018 and anticipates adopting this standard using the modified retrospective method. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact that ASU No. 2014-09 will have on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and financial statement disclosures. While the Company is continuing to assess all impacts of ASU No. 2014-09, it currently believes the most significant areas potentially impacted by this new standard relate to its accounting for customer incentives and cooperative advertising. The Company expects to complete its evaluation of the impact of adopting ASU No. 2014-09 in 2017 and will provide further updates in future periods.\nInflation\nThe Company's costs are affected by inflation and the effects of inflation that the Company may experience in future periods. Management believes, however, that such effects have not been material to the Company during the past three years in the U.S. and in foreign non-hyperinflationary countries. The Company operates in certain countries around the world, such as Argentina, which has experienced hyperinflation. In hyperinflationary foreign countries, the Company attempts to mitigate the effects of inflation by increasing prices in line with inflation, where possible, and efficiently managing its costs and working capital levels.\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(all tabular amounts in millions)", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I am unable to complete your request because I am

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Our MD&A is presented as follows:\n \u2022 Overview; \n \u2022 Operating Segments; \n \u2022 Results of Operations; \n \u2022 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources; \n \u2022 Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments; \n \u2022 Off-Balance Sheet Transactions (there are none); \n \u2022 Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies; \n \u2022 Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements; \n \u2022 Recently Issued Accounting Standards or Updates Not Yet Effective; and \n \u2022 Inflation. \nThe Company (as defined below) is providing this overview in accordance with the SEC's December 2003 interpretive guidance regarding MD&A.\nOverview\nOverview of the Business\nRevlon Consumer Products Corporation (\"Products Corporation\" and together with its subsidiaries, including Elizabeth Arden, Inc., the \"Company\") is a wholly-owned operating subsidiary of Revlon, Inc. (\"Revlon\"), which is an indirect majority-owned subsidiary of MacAndrews & Forbes Incorporated (together with certain of its affiliates other than Revlon and the Company, \"MacAndrews & Forbes\"), a corporation wholly-owned by Ronald O. Perelman.\nThe Company operates in four segments: the consumer division ( Consumer\u201d); the professional division ( Professional\u201d); Elizabeth Arden; and Other. The Company manufactures, markets and sells an extensive array of beauty and personal care products worldwide, including color cosmetics, fragrances, skin care, hair color, hair care and hair treatments, beauty tools, men's grooming products, anti-perspirant deodorants and other beauty care products.\nFor additional information regarding our business, see \"Part 1, Item 1 - Business\" in this Form 10-K.\nDiscontinued Operations Presentation\nAs a result of the Company's decision on December 30, 2013 to exit its direct manufacturing, warehousing and sales business operations in mainland China within its Consumer segment effective December 31, 2013, the Company is reporting the results of its former China operations within income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income. Unless otherwise stated, financial results discussed within \"Overview\" and \"Results of Operations\" refer only to continuing operations. See Note 4, \"Discontinued Operations,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion.\nOverview of Net Sales and Earnings Results\nConsolidated net sales in 2016 were $2,334.0 million, an increase of $419.7 million, or 21.9%, compared to $1,914.3 million in 2015. Excluding the $43.9 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations (referred to herein as FX,\u201d XFX\u201d or on an \"XFX basis\"), consolidated net sales increased by $463.6 million, or 24.2%, in 2016 compared to the 2015. The XFX increase in 2016 was primarily driven by the inclusion of $441.4 million of net sales as a result of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition from and after the September 7, 2016 Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date; a $11.1 million, or 2.4%, increase in Professional segment net sales; and a $9.7 million, or 0.7%, increase in Consumer segment net sales.\nConsolidated loss from continuing operations, net of taxes, in 2016 was $10.8 million, compared to $65.3 million of consolidated income from continuing operations, net of taxes, in 2015. The $76.1 million decrease in consolidated income from continuing operations, net of taxes, in 2016 was primarily due to:\n \u2022 $158.1 million of higher SG&A expenses, primarily driven by the inclusion of the SG&A expenses of the Elizabeth Arden segment, commencing on and after the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date; \nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\n \u2022 $35.2 million increase in acquisition and integration costs, primarily related to the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition; \n \u2022 $23.5 million increase in restructuring charges and other, net, in 2016, which primarily included $31.7 million in restructuring charges recognized in 2016 related to the EA Integration Restructuring Program, as compared to $9.5 million of restructuring charges and other, net, recognized in 2015, primarily due to the 2015 Efficiency Program; \n \u2022 a $23.4 million non-cash impairment loss on goodwill and acquired intangible assets for the Company's Other reporting unit recognized in 2016, as compared to a $9.7 million non-cash impairment loss on goodwill for the Company's Global Color Brands reporting unit recognized in 2015; \n \u2022 a $21.9 million increase in interest expense incurred during 2016 primarily as a result of the debt-related transactions completed during the third quarter of 2016 in connection with financing the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition and the complete refinancing of the Old Term Loan Facility, as discussed below; and \n \u2022 a $16.9 million aggregate loss on the early extinguishment of debt recognized in the third quarter of 2016 as a result of the complete refinancing of the Old Term Loan Facility in connection with the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition; \nwith the foregoing partially offset by:\n \u2022 $170.4 million of higher gross profit in 2016, primarily due to the inclusion of gross profit of the Elizabeth Arden segment, commencing on and after the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date, partially offset by lower gross profit within the Consumer segment; and \n \u2022 a $25.7 million decrease in the provision for income taxes recognized in 2016, primarily due to lower pre-tax income for 2016, as compared to 2015, partially offset by the impairment in 2016 related to the Company's Other segment for which there was no tax benefit and the tax benefit realized in 2015 for the reduction of the deferred tax valuation allowance that did not exist in 2016.  These items are discussed in more detail within \"Results of Operations\" and within \"Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below.\nRecent Events\nAcquisition of Elizabeth Arden\nOn September 7, 2016, the Company completed the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition. Elizabeth Arden is a global prestige beauty products company with an iconic portfolio of fragrance, skin care and color cosmetics brands that are highly complementary to the Company's existing brand portfolio and are sold worldwide. Elizabeth Arden's brands include Skin Illuminating, SUPERSTART, Prevage, Eight Hour Cream, Elizabeth Arden Ceramide and Visible Difference in the Elizabeth Arden skin care brands; Elizabeth Arden Red Door, Elizabeth Arden 5th Avenue, Elizabeth Arden Green Tea and UNTOLD in Elizabeth Arden fragrances; Juicy Couture, John Varvatos, and Wildfox Couture in designer fragrances; and Curve, Elizabeth Taylor, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Halston, Ed Hardy, Geoffrey Beene, Alfred Sung, Giorgio Beverly Hills, Lucky Brand, PS Fine Cologne for Men, White Shoulders and Jennifer Aniston in heritage fragrances. In North America, Elizabeth Arden's principal customers include prestige retailers, specialty stores, the mass retail channel, distributors, department stores and other retailers, as well as direct sales to consumers via its Elizabeth Arden Red Door branded retail stores and Elizabeth Arden.com e-commerce business. Elizabeth Arden products are also sold through the Elizabeth Arden Red Door Spa beauty salons and spas. Internationally, Elizabeth Arden's portfolio of owned and licensed brands is sold to perfumeries, boutiques, department stores, travel retailers and distributors. The operating results and purchase accounting for the Company's Elizabeth Arden Acquisition are presented in the Elizabeth Arden reporting segment.\nEA Integration Restructuring Program\nIn December 2016, in connection with integrating the Elizabeth Arden and Revlon organizations, the Company determined to begin the process of implementing the EA Integration Restructuring Program, consisting of certain integration activities, including consolidating offices, eliminating certain duplicative activities and streamlining back-office support. The EA Integration Restructuring Program is designed to reduce the Company's SG&A expenses. As a result of the EA Integration Restructuring Program, the Company expects to eliminate approximately 350 positions worldwide and expects to recognize approximately $65 million to $75 million of EA Integration Restructuring Charges, consisting of: (i) approximately $40 million to $50 million of employee-related costs, including severance, retention and other contractual termination benefits; (ii) approximately $15 million of lease termination costs; and (iii) approximately $10 million of other related charges.\nAs a result of the EA Integration Restructuring Program, as well as other actions related to integrating the Elizabeth Arden organiz\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nation into the Company's business, the Company has identified annualized synergies and cost reductions of approximately $190 million. The approximately $190 million of expected annualized synergies and cost reductions are expected to be generated over a multi-year period, with approximately 90% expected to be achieved by the end of 2020. For 2016, the Company realized approximately $3 million of these annualized cost reductions, which primarily benefited the Elizabeth Arden segment results.\nIn order to capture these annualized synergies and cost reductions, the Company anticipates that it will incur, over a multi-year period, approximately $100 million to $110 million of cumulative integration-related capital expenditures and approximately $70 million to $80 million of cumulative non-restructuring integration costs.\nIn 2016, the Company incurred $34.5 million of restructuring charges in connection with the EA Integration Integration Restructuring Program and $41.7 million of acquisition and integration costs related to the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition.\nFor further discussion of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition and the EA Integration Restructuring Program, see Note 2, \"Business Combinations,\" and Note 3, \"Restructuring Charges - EA Integration Restructuring Program,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nAcquisition of Cutex International\nOn May 31, 2016, the Company completed the Cutex International Acquisition, consisting of the acquisition of certain international Cutex businesses from Coty Inc., which primarily operate in Australia and the U.K., and related assets for total cash consideration of $29.1 million. Following the Company's October 2015 Cutex U.S. Acquisition, combined with other Cutex businesses that the Company acquired in 1998, the Cutex International Acquisition completed the Company's global consolidation of the Cutex brand, enhancing and complementing the Company's existing brand portfolio of nail care products. The Cutex International results of operations are included in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements commencing on the Cutex International Acquisition Date. See Note 2, \"Business Combinations,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further details related to the Cutex International Acquisition.\n2016 Debt-Related Transactions\nIn connection with and substantially concurrently with the closing of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, Products Corporation entered into: (i) its 7-year $1,800.0 million senior secured 2016 Term Loan Facility; and (ii) its 5-year $400.0 million 2016 Revolving Credit Facility. As part of financing the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, in August 2016 Products Corporation also completed the issuances of $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.25% Senior Notes due 2024, which funds were released from escrow on the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date. In connection with entering into the 2016 Senior Credit Facilities, Products Corporation maintained on the 2016 Term Loan Facility its existing floating-to-fixed 2013 Interest Rate Swap based on a notional amount of $400 million that previously applied to Products Corporation's Old Acquisition Term Loan, which loan was refinanced in full in connection with Products Corporation's consummation of the 2016 Senior Credit Facilities and the 6.25% Senior Notes. The proceeds of Products Corporation's 6.25% Senior Notes Offering and the 2016 Term Loan Facility, together with approximately $35.0 million of borrowings under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, and approximately $126.7 million of cash on hand, were used: (A) to fund the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, including: (i) repurchasing the entire $350.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Elizabeth Arden Senior Notes; (ii) repaying the entire $142.0 million aggregate principal amount of borrowings outstanding as of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date under Elizabeth Arden's then-existing $300.0 million revolving credit facility (which facility was terminated upon such repayment); (iii) repaying the entire $25.0 million aggregate principal amount of borrowings then-outstanding as of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date under Elizabeth Arden's second lien credit facility (which facility was terminated upon such repayment); and (iv) retiring the entire $55.0 million liquidation preference of all 50,000 shares of Elizabeth Arden's issued and outstanding Preferred Stock (which amount included a $5.0 million change of control premium); and (B) to completely refinance and repay all of the $651.4 million in aggregate principal balance outstanding under Products Corporation's 2011 Term Loan and all of the $658.6 million in aggregate principal balance outstanding under Products Corporation's Old Acquisition Term Loan (each of which facilities were terminated upon such repayment). The Company did not incur any material early termination penalties in connection with repaying the Old Term Loan Facility or the Elizabeth Arden indebtedness and preferred stock.\nIn February 2016, Products Corporation prepaid $23.2 million of indebtedness then outstanding under the Old Term Loan Facility, representing 50% of its 2015 excess cash flow\u201d as defined by, and as required under, the Old Term Loan Agreement. The prepayment was applied on a ratable basis between the principal amounts outstanding under the 2011 Term Loan and the Old Acquisition Term Loan. The amount of the prepayment that was applied to the 2011 Term Loan reduced the principal amount outstanding by $11.5 million to $651.4 million (as all amortization payments under the 2011 Term Loan had been paid). The $11.7 million that was applied to the Old Acquisition Term Loan reduced Products Corporation's future annual amortization payments under such loan on a ratable basis from $6.9 million prior to the prepayment to $6.8 million after giving effect to the prepayment.\nSee Part II, Item 7 - \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Long-Term Debt Instruments,\u201d for further discussion of the above debt transactions.\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nNon-cash Impairment Charges\nFor purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test, the CBB business, which was acquired in April 2015, is included within the Company's Other reporting unit. The results of the step one test indicated that impairment indicators may have existed for the Company's Other reporting unit due to the termination of certain fragrance licenses that were not replaced, and accordingly, the Company performed step two of the goodwill impairment test for this reporting unit. As a result, in conjunction with the Company's annual impairment test, the Company recognized $23.4 million in non-cash impairment charges during the fourth quarter of 2016. Of this amount, $16.7 million related to goodwill and $6.7 million related to intangible assets acquired in the CBB Acquisition. These non-cash impairment charges are primarily due to the Company's expectations regarding the future performance of the Other reporting unit, in relation to the carrying amounts of CBB's goodwill and acquired intangible assets. See Note 8, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further details on these non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges.\nOperating Segments\nThe Company operates in four reporting segments: the consumer division ( Consumer\u201d); the professional division ( Professional\u201d); Elizabeth Arden; and Other:\n \u2022 The Consumer segment is comprised of the Company's consumer brands, which primarily include Revlon, Almay, SinfulColors and Pure Ice in color cosmetics; Revlon ColorSilk in women's hair color; Revlon in beauty tools; and Mitchum in anti-perspirant deodorants. The Company's principal customers for its consumer products include large volume retailers, chain drug and food stores, chemist shops, hypermarkets, general merchandise stores, the Internet/e-commerce, television shopping, department stores, one-stop shopping beauty retailers, specialty cosmetics stores and perfumeries in the U.S. and internationally. The Consumer segment also includes a skin care line under the Natural Honey brand and a hair color line under the Llongueras brand (licensed from a third party) sold to large volume retailers and other retailers, primarily in Spain, which were acquired as part of the Colomer Acquisition. In October 2015 and in May 2016, the Company acquired Cutex businesses in the U.S. and in certain international territories and related assets, respectively. The results of operations relating to the sales of Cutex nail care products are included within the Consumer segment. \n \u2022 The Professional segment is comprised primarily of the Company's professional brands, which include Revlon Professional in hair color and hair care; CND-branded products in nail polishes and nail enhancements; and American Crew in men's grooming products, all of which are sold worldwide to professional salons. The Company's principal customers for its professional products include hair and nail salons and distributors to professional salons in the U.S. and internationally. The Professional segment also includes a multi-cultural hair care line consisting of Creme of Nature hair care products sold to professional salons, large volume retailers and other retailers, primarily in the U.S. \n \u2022 The Elizabeth Arden segment includes the operating results of the Elizabeth Arden business and related purchase accounting for the Company's September 2016 Elizabeth Arden Acquisition. Elizabeth Arden is a global prestige beauty products company with an iconic portfolio of prestige fragrance, skin care and cosmetic brands, which includes the Elizabeth Arden skin care brands, color cosmetics and fragrances; designer fragrances such as Juicy Couture, John Varvatos and Wildfox Couture; heritage fragrances such as Curve, Elizabeth Taylor, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera; and celebrity fragrances. \n \u2022 The Other segment primarily includes the operating results of the CBBeauty Group and certain of its related entities, which the Company acquired in April 2015. CBB develops, markets and distributes fragrances and other beauty products under various celebrity, lifestyle and fashion brands licensed from third parties, principally through department stores and selective distribution in international territories. \nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Net Sales:\nYear-to-date results:\nConsolidated net sales in 2016 were $2,334.0 million, a $419.7 million increase, or 21.9%, as compared to $1,914.3 million in 2015. Excluding the $43.9 million unfavorable FX impact, consolidated net sales increased on an XFX basis by $463.6 million, or 24.2%, during 2016.\nConsolidated net sales in 2015 were $1,914.3 million, a decrease of $26.7 million, or 1.4%, compared to $1,941.0 million in 2014. Excluding the $121.2 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, consolidated net sales increased $94.5 million, or 4.9%, during 2015, primarily driven by an increase in Consumer segment net sales of $53.9 million, or 3.7%, and the inclusion of $28.4 million of net sales as a result of the CBB Acquisition.\nSee \"Segment Results\" below for further discussion.\nSegment Results:\nThe Company's management evaluates segment profit, which is defined as income from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, gains/losses on foreign currency fluctuations, gains/losses on the early extinguishment of debt and miscellaneous expenses, for each of the Company's reportable segments. Segment profit also excludes unallocated corporate expenses and the impact of certain items that are not directly attributable to the segments' underlying operating performance, which includes the impact of: (i) restructuring and related charges; (ii) acquisition and integration costs; (iii) deferred compensation related to the accounting for the CBB Acquisition; (iv) costs of sales resulting from fair value adjustments in the second quarter of 2016 and 2015 related to inventory acquired in the Cutex International Acquisition and the CBB Acquisition, respectively; (v) charges related to the Elizabeth Arden 2016 Business Transformation Program; (vi) costs of sales resulting from a fair value adjustment to inventory acquired in the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition; (vii) goodwill and acquired intangible asset impairment charges; and (viii) pension lump sum settlement charges. Unallocated corporate expenses primarily include general and administrative expenses related to the corporate organization. These expenses are recorded in unallocated corporate expenses as these items are centrally directed and controlled and are not included in internal measures of segment operating performance. The Company does not have any material inter-segment sales. For a reconciliation of segment profit to income from continuing operations before income taxes, see Note 19, \"Segment Data and Related Information,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nThe following tables provide a comparative summary of the Company's segment results for each of 2016, 2015 and 2014.\n\n(a) XFX excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\n\n(a) XFX excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\nConsumer Segment\nConsumer segment net sales in 2016 were $1,389.8 million, a $25.0 million or 1.8% decrease, compared to $1,414.8 million in 2015. Excluding the $34.7 million unfavorable FX impact, total Consumer net sales in 2016 increased by $9.7 million, or 0.7%, compared to 2015. This increase was primarily driven by higher net sales of Cutex nail care products from the Company's global consolidation of the Cutex brand, which was completed with two separate acquisitions that closed for the U.S. in October 2015 and for the U.K., Australia and certain other International territories in May 2016, as well as higher net sales of Revlon beauty tools and Mitchum anti-perspirant deodorant products, partially offset by lower net sales of Almay color cosmetics. Net sales of Revlon color cosmetics were essentially flat, as strong sales growth internationally was offset by lower net sales in North America due to softening trade conditions in core cosmetics categories.\nConsumer segment profit in 2016 was $349.2 million, a $11.0 million, or 3.1%, decrease, as compared to $360.2 million in 2015. Excluding the $2.7 million unfavorable FX impact, Consumer segment profit in 2016 decreased by $8.3 million, or 2.3%, compared to 2015. This decrease was partially due to a 2015 gain of $3.5 million related to the sale of a non-core consumer brand. In addition, Consumer segment profit decreased due to the unfavorable impact of FX transaction within cost of sales, partially offset by decreased brand support on lower performing brands.\nConsumer segment net sales in 2015 were $1,414.8 million, a decrease of $23.5 million, or 1.6%, as compared to $1,438.3 million in 2014. Excluding the $77.4 million unfavorable FX impact, total Consumer net sales in 2015 increased $53.9 million, or 3.7%, as compared to 2014, primarily driven by higher net sales of Revlon color cosmetics, Mitchum anti-perspirant deodorant products, Revlon ColorSilk hair color and Cutex nail products, partially offset by lower net sales of Almay color cosmetics. Consumer segment net sales were negatively impacted in connection with the Company's exit of its business operations in Venezuela in the second quarter of 2015 and change to a distributor model, as such change resulted in $1.0 million of net sales in Venezuela in 2015, compared to $16.3 million of net sales in Venezuela in 2014. Excluding Venezuela, on an XFX basis, Consumer net sales would have increased by 4.4% in 2015, as compared to 2014.\nConsumer segment profit in 2015 was $360.2 million, an increase of $20.8 million, or 6.1%, as compared to $339.4 million in 2014. Excluding the $9.2 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, Consumer segment profit in 2015 increased $30.0 million, or 8.8%, as compared to 2014, primarily driven by higher gross profit as a result of the increases in net sales discussed above, partially offset by $8.7 million of higher brand support expenses for the Company's Consumer brands. In connection with the Company's exit of its business operations in Venezuela in the second quarter of 2015 and change to a distributor model, there was no profit in Venezuela in 2015, compared to $6.6 million of profit in Venezuela in 2014. Excluding Venezuela, on an XFX basis, Consumer segment profit would have increased by 11.1% in 2015, as compared to 2014.\nProfessional Segment\nProfessional segment net sales in 2016 were $476.5 million, a $5.4 million, or 1.1%, increase, as compared to $471.1 million in 2015. Excluding the $5.7 million unfavorable FX impact, total Professional net sales in 2016 increased by $11.1 million as compared to 2015. This increase was driven primarily by higher net sales of American Crew men's grooming products as a result of the Elvis Presley branded marketing campaign and Revlon Professional hair products in part due to the launch of Revlon Professional Be Fabulous and Revlonissimo Colorsmetique. These increases were partially offset by lower net sales of CND nail products.\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nProfessional segment profit in 2016 was $99.4 million, a $4.5 million, or 4.3%, decrease, as compared to $103.9 million in 2015, primarily driven by the absence in 2016 of a $3.0 million gain related to the sale of a non-core professional brand that was completed in 2015.\nProfessional segment net sales in 2015 were $471.1 million, a decrease of $31.6 million, or 6.3%, compared to $502.7 million in 2014. Excluding the $43.8 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, total Professional net sales increased by $12.2 million in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily as a result of higher net sales of American Crew men's grooming products, Revlon Professional hair products and Creme of Nature hair products, partially offset by lower net sales of CND nail products in the U.S.\nProfessional segment profit in 2015 was $103.9 million, a decrease of $0.9 million, or 0.9%, compared to $104.8 million in 2014. Excluding the $3.7 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, Professional segment profit increased $2.8 million in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to higher net sales, partially offset by $5.1 million of higher brand support expenses for the Company's Professional brands and a favorable adjustment in 2014 of $3.4 million related to the inventory obsolescence reserve, with no similar adjustment in 2015.\nElizabeth Arden Segment\nThe Elizabeth Arden segment is comprised of the operations acquired by the Company in the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, which closed on September 7, 2016. An analysis of net sales and segment profit for the Elizabeth Arden segment for 2016 is not included in this Form 10-K, as the Company does not have any comparable prior year's net sales or segment profit for the Elizabeth Arden segment.\nElizabeth Arden operations have historically been seasonal, with higher net sales generally occurring in the second half of the calendar year as a result of increased demand by retailers in anticipation of and during the holiday season. As a result, the operating results of the Elizabeth Arden segment following the Acquisition Date include the effects of seasonality.\nOther Segment\nOther segment net sales in 2016 were $26.3 million, a $2.1 million, or 7.4%, decrease, compared to $28.4 million in 2015. Excluding the $3.5 million unfavorable FX impact, total Other segment net sales in 2016 increased by $1.4 million, or 4.9%, compared to 2015. This increase was primarily driven by net sales associated with newly-acquired distribution rights in Europe.\nOther segment loss in 2016 was $2.7 million, a $4.1 million decrease, compared to a $1.4 million profit in 2015. This decrease was primarily driven by higher packaging and design expenses.\nGeographic Results:\nIn connection with changes that the organization made to its management reporting structure following the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, beginning with the third quarter of 2016, the Company has combined its former U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico operating regions into the North America region for reporting purposes. The Company has modified its net sales discussion to conform to management's procedures for reviewing the business, and, accordingly, the amounts for 2016, 2015 and 2014 have been restated to conform to this presentation.\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nThe following tables provide a comparative summary of the Company's net sales by region for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\n\n(a) XFX excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\n\n(a) XFX excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\nConsumer Segment\nNorth America\nIn the Consumer segment, North America net sales in 2016 decreased by $38.9 million, or 4.2%, to $882.4 million, as compared to $921.3 million in 2015. Excluding the $2.0 million unfavorable FX impact, Consumer segment net sales in North America in 2016 decreased by $36.9 million, or 4.0%, as compared to 2015. This decrease was primarily driven by the results of softening trade conditions in core categories, which impacted Revlon color cosmetics and Almay color cosmetics, as well as increased competition impacting Revlon ColorSilk hair color. These decreases were partially offset by incremental net sales in connection with the Company completing the global consolidation of the Cutex nail care brand, as well as higher net sales of Revlon beauty tools.\nIn the Consumer segment, North America net sales in 2015 increased by $20.6 million, or 2.3%, to $921.3 million, as compared to $900.7 million in 2014. Excluding the $8.7 million unfavorable FX impact, Consumer segment net sales in North America\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nincreased by $29.3 million, or 3.3%, in 2015, as compared to 2014. This increase was primarily driven by higher net sales of Revlon color cosmetics, Mitchum anti-perspirant deodorant products and Revlon ColorSilk hair color, partially offset by lower net sales of Almay color cosmetics.\nInternational\nIn the Consumer segment, International net sales in 2016 increased by $13.9 million, or 2.8%, to $507.4 million, as compared to $493.5 million in 2015. Excluding the $32.7 million unfavorable FX impact, Consumer segment International net sales in 2016 increased by $46.6 million, or 9.4%, as compared to 2015. This increase was primarily driven by higher net sales of Revlon color cosmetics, Revlon ColorSilk hair color, as well as incremental net sales of Cutex nail care products. The increase in International net sales was mainly driven by higher net sales in Argentina, the U.K. and Mexico.\nIn the Consumer segment, International net sales in 2015 decreased by $44.1 million, or 8.2% to $493.5 million, as compared to $537.6 million in 2014. Excluding the $68.7 million unfavorable FX impact, Consumer segment International net sales increased by 24.6 million, or 4.6%, in 2015, as compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher net sales of Revlon color cosmetics. The Company's exit of its business operations in Venezuela in 2015 negatively impacted International net sales. Excluding Venezuela, on an XFX basis, International net sales would have increased by 10.0% in 2015, as compared to 2014.\nProfessional Segment\nNorth America\nIn the Professional segment, North America net sales in 2016 increased by $3.1 million, or 1.5%, to $204.9 million, as compared to $201.8 million in 2015. Excluding the $0.8 million unfavorable FX impact, Professional segment net sales in North America in 2016 increased on an XFX basis by $3.9 million, or 1.9%, as compared to 2015. This increase was primarily driven by increased net sales of American Crew men's grooming products as a result of the Elvis Presley branded marketing campaign as well as Creme of Nature hair products, partially offset by lower net sales of CND nail products.\nIn the Professional segment, North America net sales in 2015 decreased by $12.5 million, or 5.8%, to $201.8 million, as compared to $214.3 million in 2014. Excluding the $3.7 million unfavorable FX impact, Professional segment net sales in North America decreased on an XFX basis by $8.8 million, or 4.1%, in 2015, as compared to 2014. This decrease was primarily driven by lower net sales of CND nail products.\nInternational\nIn the Professional segment, International net sales in 2016 increased by $2.3 million, or 0.9%, to $271.6 million, as compared to $269.3 million in 2015. Excluding the $4.9 million unfavorable FX impact, Professional segment International net sales increased by $7.2 million, or 2.7%, in 2016, as compared to 2015. This increase was primarily due to higher net sales of Revlon Professional hair products, in part due to the launch of Revlon Professional Be Fabulous, as well as an increase in net sales of American Crew men's grooming products throughout most of the International region. These increases were partially offset by lower net sales of CND nail products.\nIn the Professional segment, International net sales in 2015 decreased by $19.1 million, or 6.6%, to $269.3 million, as compared to $288.4 million in 2014. Excluding the $40.1 million unfavorable FX impact, Professional segment International net sales in 2015 increased by $21.0 million, or 7.3%, as compared to 2014. This increase was primarily due to higher net sales of American Crew men's grooming products and Revlon Professional hair products throughout most of the International region.\nElizabeth Arden Segment\nThe Elizabeth Arden segment is comprised of the operations acquired by the Company in the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition which closed on September 7, 2016. Therefore, an analysis of net sales and segment profit for the Elizabeth Arden segment for 2016 is not included in this Form 10-K, as the Company does not have any comparable prior year's net sales or segment profit for the Elizabeth Arden segment.\nElizabeth Arden operations have historically been seasonal, with higher net sales generally occurring in the second half of the calendar year as a result of increased demand by retailers in anticipation of and during the holiday season. As a result, the operating results of the Elizabeth Arden segment following the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date include the effects of seasonality.\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nOther Segment\nNorth America\nThe Other segment consists of operations primarily within the International region.

Gross profit decreased in 2015 as a percentage of net sales by 0.5 percentage points, decreasing by $26.2 million in 2015, as compared to 2014. The drivers of the changes in gross profit in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily included:\n \u2022 unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, which reduced gross profit by $90.0 million and reduced gross profit as a percentage of net sales by 0.5 percentage points; \n \u2022 the unfavorable impact of a portion of the 2015 pension lump sum settlement charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 within cost of sales in the amount of $10.5 million, which decreased gross profit by as a percentage of net sales by 0.6 percentage points. \nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\n \u2022 the effects of the favorable sales returns accrual adjustments made in 2015 and 2014, due to lower expected discontinued products in the future related to the Company's strategy to focus on fewer, bigger and better innovations, which 2014 adjustment was $4.1 million more favorable than the 2015 adjustment, and which had no impact on gross profit as a percentage of net sales;  with the foregoing partially offset by:\n \u2022 favorable volume, which increased gross profit by $67.8 million and increased gross profit as a percentage of net sales by 0.2 percentage points; and \n \u2022 lower manufacturing and freight costs as a result of supply chain cost reduction initiatives, which increased gross profit by $9.5 million and increased gross profit as a percentage of net sales by 0.5 percentage points. \nSG&A expenses:\n\nSG&A expenses increased by $158.1 million in 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily driven by:\n \u2022 the inclusion of SG&A expenses in the Elizabeth Arden segment as a result of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, commencing on and after the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date, which contributed $184.2 million to the increase in SG&A expenses; and \n \u2022 $6.5 million of higher general and administrative expenses in 2016, primarily due to higher compensation due to changes in senior executive management, higher professional and legal fees and a total of $6.5 million in gains recognized in 2015 related to the sales of certain non-core assets, partially offset by $10.2 million of charges recognized in 2015 related to a pension lump sum settlement recorded as a component of SG&A expense and lower non-restructuring severance;  with the foregoing partially offset by:\n \u2022 $19.8 million of favorable FX impacts; and \n \u2022 a $24.3 million decrease in brand support expenses for lower performing brands, primarily within the Consumer segment.  SG&A expenses decreased by $6.2 million in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily driven by:\n \u2022 $72.2 million of favorable impact due to foreign currency fluctuations in 2015;  with the foregoing partially offset by:\n \u2022 $16.2 million of higher brand support expenses for the Company's brands within the Consumer and Professional segments in 2015; and \n \u2022 $49.3 million of higher general and administrative expenses in 2015, primarily due to:  (i) $14.7 million of severance costs related to a 2015 initiative to upgrade the Company's people and talent; (ii) $10.2 million of charges related to the 2015 pension lump sum settlement discussed above; (iii) $9.8 million in expenses related to the 2015 operations of the CBB business acquired in April 2015; and (iv) higher incentive compensation expenses.\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nAcquisition and Integration Costs:\n\nThe Company incurred $43.2 million of acquisition and integration costs in 2016, primarily related to the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition.\nAcquisition costs in 2016 of $21.5 million primarily included legal and consulting fees related to the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition.

See Part II, Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview - Recent Events - Debt-Related Transactions.\"\nThe $1.1 million decrease in interest expense in 2015, compared to 2014, was primarily due to lower average debt outstanding, partially offset by higher weighted average borrowing rates. The lower average debt outstanding was the result of: (i) regularly scheduled quarterly amortization payments made towards the Old Acquisition Term Loan through December 31, 2015; (ii) the favorable benefit to 2015 as a result of the May 1, 2014 prepayment of the remaining $58.4 million principal amount outstanding under the Non-Contributed Loan; and (iii) the $24.6 million March 2015 excess cash flow prepayment under the Old Term Loan Facility. The higher weighted average borrowing rates were primarily due to the impact of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap going into effect in May 2015.\nRefer to Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Long-Term Debt Instruments\u201d for further discussion.\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt:\n\nThe Company recognized a $16.9 million aggregate loss on the early extinguishment of debt during in 2016, primarily due to approximately $6.0 million of fees and expenses that were expensed as incurred in connection with entering into the 2016 Senior Credit Facilities, as well as the write-off of $10.9 million of unamortized debt discount and deferred financing fees previously capitalized in connection with the September 2016 repayment of the Old Term Loan Facility.\nThe Company recognized an aggregate loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $2.0 million during 2014, primarily due to $1.1 million of fees and expenses which were expensed as incurred in connection with the then-existing term loan facility, as well as the write-off of $0.8 million of unamortized debt discount and deferred financing fees as a result of such transaction. The remaining $0.1 million was related to the write-off of deferred financing costs in connection with the early repayment of the principal amount outstanding under the Non-Contributed Loan.\nRefer to Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Long-Term Debt Instruments\u201d for further discussion.\nForeign currency (gains) losses, net:\n\nThe $2.8 million increase in foreign currency losses in 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily driven by:\n \u2022 a $2.1 million gain in 2016, compared to a $3.8 million gain in 2015 related to the Company's foreign currency forward exchange contracts; and \nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\n \u2022 the net unfavorable impact of the revaluation of certain U.S. Dollar denominated intercompany payables and foreign currency denominated receivables.  The $9.3 million decrease in foreign currency losses in 2015, as compared to 2014, was primarily driven by:\n \u2022 a $6.0 million foreign currency loss recognized in 2014 as a result of the re-measurement of Revlon Venezuela's balance sheet, as compared to a $1.9 million foreign currency loss recognized in 2015; \n \u2022 a $3.8 million gain in 2015, compared to a $0.5 million gain in 2014, related to the Company's foreign currency forward exchange contracts; and \n \u2022 the favorable impact of the revaluation of certain U.S. Dollar and foreign currency denominated intercompany payables during 2015, as compared to 2014. \nProvision for income taxes:\n\nThe provision for income taxes decreased by $25.7 million in 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to lower pre-tax income for 2016, as compared to 2015, partially offset by lack of benefit from the 2016 goodwill and intangible assets impairment, as well as the benefit in 2015 for the reduction of the deferred tax valuation allowance that did not exist in 2016.\nThe provision for income taxes decreased by $26.8 million in 2015, compared to 2014, primarily due to the favorable impact of certain discrete items, including: (i) the net reduction of valuation allowances in certain foreign jurisdictions; (ii) lower pre-tax income in certain jurisdictions for 2015, as compared to 2014; (iii) the impact of the favorable resolution of certain tax matters in 2015; and (iv) the unfavorable impact of certain tax matters in 2014 that did not recur in 2015.\nThe Company's effective tax rate for 2016 was higher than the 35% federal statutory rate as a result of: (i) state and local taxes; (ii) foreign dividends and earnings taxable in the U.S.; and (iii) the impairment related to the Company's Other segment for which there was no tax benefit.\nThe Company's effective tax rate for 2015 was higher than the federal statutory rate of 35% due principally to: (i) foreign and U.S. tax effects attributable to operations outside the U.S.; (ii) state and local taxes; and (iii) foreign dividends and earnings taxable in the U.S., partially offset by the net reduction of valuation allowances in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nThe Company expects that its tax provision and effective tax rate in any individual quarter and year-to-date period will vary and may not be indicative of the Company's tax provision and effective tax rate for the full year.\nIn assessing the recoverability of its deferred tax assets, management regularly considers whether some portion or all of the", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

See Note 4, \"Discontinued Operations,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion.\nOverview of Net Sales and Earnings Results\nConsolidated net sales in 2016 were $2,334.0 million, an increase of $419.7 million, or 21.9%, compared to $1,914.3 million in 2015. Excluding the $43.9 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations (referred to herein as FX,\u201d XFX\u201d or on an \"XFX basis\"), consolidated net sales increased by $463.6 million, or 24.2%, in 2016 compared to the 2015. The XFX increase in 2016 was primarily driven by the inclusion of $441.4 million of net sales as a result of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition from and after the September 7, 2016 Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date; a $11.1 million, or 2.4%, increase in Professional segment net sales; and a $9.7 million, or 0.7%, increase in Consumer segment net sales.\nConsolidated loss from continuing operations, net of taxes, in 2016 was $10.8 million, compared to $65.3 million of consolidated income from continuing operations, net of taxes, in 2015. The $76.1 million decrease in consolidated income from continuing operations, net of taxes, in 2016 was primarily due to:\n \u2022 $158.1 million of higher SG&A expenses, primarily driven by the inclusion of the SG&A expenses of the Elizabeth Arden segment, commencing on and after the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date; \nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\n \u2022 $35.2 million increase in acquisition and integration costs, primarily related to the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition; \n \u2022 $23.5 million increase in restructuring charges and other, net, in 2016, which primarily included $31.7 million in restructuring charges recognized in 2016 related to the EA Integration Restructuring Program, as compared to $9.5 million of restructuring charges and other, net, recognized in 2015, primarily due to the 2015 Efficiency Program; \n \u2022 a $23.4 million non-cash impairment loss on goodwill and acquired intangible assets for the Company's Other reporting unit recognized in 2016, as compared to a $9.7 million non-cash impairment loss on goodwill for the Company's Global Color Brands reporting unit recognized in 2015; \n \u2022 a $21.9 million increase in interest expense incurred during 2016 primarily as a result of the debt-related transactions completed during the third quarter of 2016 in connection with financing the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition and the complete refinancing of the Old Term Loan Facility, as discussed below; and \n \u2022 a $16.9 million aggregate loss on the early extinguishment of debt recognized in the third quarter of 2016 as a result of the complete refinancing of the Old Term Loan Facility in connection with the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition; \nwith the foregoing partially offset by:\n \u2022 $170.4 million of higher gross profit in 2016, primarily due to the inclusion of gross profit of the Elizabeth Arden segment, commencing on and after the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date, partially offset by lower gross profit within the Consumer segment; and \n \u2022 a $25.7 million decrease in the provision for income taxes recognized in 2016, primarily due to lower pre-tax income for 2016, as compared to 2015, partially offset by the impairment in 2016 related to the Company's Other segment for which there was no tax benefit and the tax benefit realized in 2015 for the reduction of the deferred tax valuation allowance that did not exist in 2016.  These items are discussed in more detail within \"Results of Operations\" and within \"Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below.\nRecent Events\nAcquisition of Elizabeth Arden\nOn September 7, 2016, the Company completed the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition. Elizabeth Arden is a global prestige beauty products company with an iconic portfolio of fragrance, skin care and color cosmetics brands that are highly complementary to the Company's existing brand portfolio and are sold worldwide. Elizabeth Arden's brands include Skin Illuminating, SUPERSTART, Prevage, Eight Hour Cream, Elizabeth Arden Ceramide and Visible Difference in the Elizabeth Arden skin care brands; Elizabeth Arden Red Door, Elizabeth Arden 5th Avenue, Elizabeth Arden Green Tea and UNTOLD in Elizabeth Arden fragrances; Juicy Couture, John Varvatos, and Wildfox Couture in designer fragrances; and Curve, Elizabeth Taylor, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Halston, Ed Hardy, Geoffrey Beene, Alfred Sung, Giorgio Beverly Hills, Lucky Brand, PS Fine Cologne for Men, White Shoulders and Jennifer Aniston in heritage fragrances.

The operating results and purchase accounting for the Company's Elizabeth Arden Acquisition are presented in the Elizabeth Arden reporting segment.\nEA Integration Restructuring Program\nIn December 2016, in connection with integrating the Elizabeth Arden and Revlon organizations, the Company determined to begin the process of implementing the EA Integration Restructuring Program, consisting of certain integration activities, including consolidating offices, eliminating certain duplicative activities and streamlining back-office support. The EA Integration Restructuring Program is designed to reduce the Company's SG&A expenses. As a result of the EA Integration Restructuring Program, the Company expects to eliminate approximately 350 positions worldwide and expects to recognize approximately $65 million to $75 million of EA Integration Restructuring Charges, consisting of: (i) approximately $40 million to $50 million of employee-related costs, including severance, retention and other contractual termination benefits; (ii) approximately $15 million of lease termination costs; and (iii) approximately $10 million of other related charges.\nAs a result of the EA Integration Restructuring Program, as well as other actions related to integrating the Elizabeth Arden organiz\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nation into the Company's business, the Company has identified annualized synergies and cost reductions of approximately $190 million. The approximately $190 million of expected annualized synergies and cost reductions are expected to be generated over a multi-year period, with approximately 90% expected to be achieved by the end of 2020. For 2016, the Company realized approximately $3 million of these annualized cost reductions, which primarily benefited the Elizabeth Arden segment results.\nIn order to capture these annualized synergies and cost reductions, the Company anticipates that it will incur, over a multi-year period, approximately $100 million to $110 million of cumulative integration-related capital expenditures and approximately $70 million to $80 million of cumulative non-restructuring integration costs.\nIn 2016, the Company incurred $34.5 million of restructuring charges in connection with the EA Integration Integration Restructuring Program and $41.7 million of acquisition and integration costs related to the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition.\nFor further discussion of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition and the EA Integration Restructuring Program, see Note 2, \"Business Combinations,\" and Note 3, \"Restructuring Charges - EA Integration Restructuring Program,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nAcquisition of Cutex International\nOn May 31, 2016, the Company completed the Cutex International Acquisition, consisting of the acquisition of certain international Cutex businesses from Coty Inc., which primarily operate in Australia and the U.K., and related assets for total cash consideration of $29.1 million. Following the Company's October 2015 Cutex U.S. Acquisition, combined with other Cutex businesses that the Company acquired in 1998, the Cutex International Acquisition completed the Company's global consolidation of the Cutex brand, enhancing and complementing the Company's existing brand portfolio of nail care products. The Cutex International results of operations are included in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements commencing on the Cutex International Acquisition Date. See Note 2, \"Business Combinations,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further details related to the Cutex International Acquisition.\n2016 Debt-Related Transactions\nIn connection with and substantially concurrently with the closing of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, Products Corporation entered into: (i) its 7-year $1,800.0 million senior secured 2016 Term Loan Facility; and (ii) its 5-year $400.0 million 2016 Revolving Credit Facility. As part of financing the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, in August 2016 Products Corporation also completed the issuances of $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.25% Senior Notes due 2024, which funds were released from escrow on the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date. In connection with entering into the 2016 Senior Credit Facilities, Products Corporation maintained on the 2016 Term Loan Facility its existing floating-to-fixed 2013 Interest Rate Swap based on a notional amount of $400 million that previously applied to Products Corporation's Old Acquisition Term Loan, which loan was refinanced in full in connection with Products Corporation's consummation of the 2016 Senior Credit Facilities and the 6.25% Senior Notes. The proceeds of Products Corporation's 6.25% Senior Notes Offering and the 2016 Term Loan Facility, together with approximately $35.0 million of borrowings under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, and approximately $126.7 million of cash on hand, were used: (A) to fund the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, including: (i) repurchasing the entire $350.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Elizabeth Arden Senior Notes; (ii) repaying the entire $142.0 million aggregate principal amount of borrowings outstanding as of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date under Elizabeth Arden's then-existing $300.0 million revolving credit facility (which facility was terminated upon such repayment); (iii) repaying the entire $25.0 million aggregate principal amount of borrowings then-outstanding as of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date under Elizabeth Arden's second lien credit facility (which facility was terminated upon such repayment); and (iv) retiring the entire $55.0 million liquidation preference of all 50,000 shares of Elizabeth Arden's issued and outstanding Preferred Stock (which amount included a $5.0 million change of control premium); and (B) to completely refinance and repay all of the $651.4 million in aggregate principal balance outstanding under Products Corporation's 2011 Term Loan and all of the $658.6 million in aggregate principal balance outstanding under Products Corporation's Old Acquisition Term Loan (each of which facilities were terminated upon such repayment). The Company did not incur any material early termination penalties in connection with repaying the Old Term Loan Facility or the Elizabeth Arden indebtedness and preferred stock.\nIn February 2016, Products Corporation prepaid $23.2 million of indebtedness then outstanding under the Old Term Loan Facility, representing 50% of its 2015 excess cash flow\u201d as defined by, and as required under, the Old Term Loan Agreement. The prepayment was applied on a ratable basis between the principal amounts outstanding under the 2011 Term Loan and the Old Acquisition Term Loan. The amount of the prepayment that was applied to the 2011 Term Loan reduced the principal amount outstanding by $11.5 million to $651.4 million (as all amortization payments under the 2011 Term Loan had been paid). The $11.7 million that was applied to the Old Acquisition Term Loan reduced Products Corporation's future annual amortization payments under such loan on a ratable basis from $6.9 million prior to the prepayment to $6.8 million after giving effect to the prepayment.\nSee Part II, Item 7 - \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Long-Term Debt Instruments,\u201d for further discussion of the above debt transactions.\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nNon-cash Impairment Charges\nFor purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test, the CBB business, which was acquired in April 2015, is included within the Company's Other reporting unit. The results of the step one test indicated that impairment indicators may have existed for the Company's Other reporting unit due to the termination of certain fragrance licenses that were not replaced, and accordingly, the Company performed step two of the goodwill impairment test for this reporting unit. As a result, in conjunction with the Company's annual impairment test, the Company recognized $23.4 million in non-cash impairment charges during the fourth quarter of 2016. Of this amount, $16.7 million related to goodwill and $6.7 million related to intangible assets acquired in the CBB Acquisition. These non-cash impairment charges are primarily due to the Company's expectations regarding the future performance of the Other reporting unit, in relation to the carrying amounts of CBB's goodwill and acquired intangible assets. See Note 8, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further details on these non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges.\nOperating Segments\nThe Company operates in four reporting segments: the consumer division ( Consumer\u201d); the professional division ( Professional\u201d); Elizabeth Arden; and Other:\n \u2022 The Consumer segment is comprised of the Company's consumer brands, which primarily include Revlon, Almay, SinfulColors and Pure Ice in color cosmetics; Revlon ColorSilk in women's hair color; Revlon in beauty tools; and Mitchum in anti-perspirant deodorants. The Company's principal customers for its consumer products include large volume retailers, chain drug and food stores, chemist shops, hypermarkets, general merchandise stores, the Internet/e-commerce, television shopping, department stores, one-stop shopping beauty retailers, specialty cosmetics stores and perfumeries in the U.S. and internationally.

Excluding the $43.9 million unfavorable FX impact, consolidated net sales increased on an XFX basis by $463.6 million, or 24.2%, during 2016.\nConsolidated net sales in 2015 were $1,914.3 million, a decrease of $26.7 million, or 1.4%, compared to $1,941.0 million in 2014. Excluding the $121.2 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, consolidated net sales increased $94.5 million, or 4.9%, during 2015, primarily driven by an increase in Consumer segment net sales of $53.9 million, or 3.7%, and the inclusion of $28.4 million of net sales as a result of the CBB Acquisition.\nSee \"Segment Results\" below for further discussion.\nSegment Results:\nThe Company's management evaluates segment profit, which is defined as income from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, gains/losses on foreign currency fluctuations, gains/losses on the early extinguishment of debt and miscellaneous expenses, for each of the Company's reportable segments. Segment profit also excludes unallocated corporate expenses and the impact of certain items that are not directly attributable to the segments' underlying operating performance, which includes the impact of: (i) restructuring and related charges; (ii) acquisition and integration costs; (iii) deferred compensation related to the accounting for the CBB Acquisition; (iv) costs of sales resulting from fair value adjustments in the second quarter of 2016 and 2015 related to inventory acquired in the Cutex International Acquisition and the CBB Acquisition, respectively; (v) charges related to the Elizabeth Arden 2016 Business Transformation Program; (vi) costs of sales resulting from a fair value adjustment to inventory acquired in the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition; (vii) goodwill and acquired intangible asset impairment charges; and (viii) pension lump sum settlement charges. Unallocated corporate expenses primarily include general and administrative expenses related to the corporate organization. These expenses are recorded in unallocated corporate expenses as these items are centrally directed and controlled and are not included in internal measures of segment operating performance. The Company does not have any material inter-segment sales. For a reconciliation of segment profit to income from continuing operations before income taxes, see Note 19, \"Segment Data and Related Information,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this

excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\nConsumer Segment\nConsumer segment net sales in 2016 were $1,389.8 million, a $25.0 million or 1.8% decrease, compared to $1,414.8 million in 2015. Excluding the $34.7 million unfavorable FX impact, total Consumer net sales in 2016 increased by $9.7 million, or 0.7%, compared to 2015. This increase was primarily driven by higher net sales of Cutex nail care products from the Company's global consolidation of the Cutex brand, which was completed with two separate acquisitions that closed for the U.S. in October 2015 and for the U.K., Australia and certain other International territories in May 2016, as well as higher net sales of Revlon beauty tools and Mitchum anti-perspirant deodorant products, partially offset by lower net sales of Almay color cosmetics. Net sales of Revlon color cosmetics were essentially flat, as strong sales growth internationally was offset by lower net sales in North America due to softening trade conditions in core cosmetics categories.\nConsumer segment profit in 2016 was $349.2 million, a $11.0 million, or 3.1%, decrease, as compared to $360.2 million in 2015. Excluding the $2.7 million unfavorable FX impact, Consumer segment profit in 2016 decreased by $8.3 million, or 2.3%, compared to 2015. This decrease was partially due to a 2015 gain of $3.5 million related to the sale of a non-core consumer brand. In addition, Consumer segment profit decreased due to the unfavorable impact of FX transaction within cost of sales, partially offset by decreased brand support on lower performing brands.\nConsumer segment net sales in 2015 were $1,414.8 million, a decrease of $23.5 million, or 1.6%, as compared to $1,438.3 million in 2014. Excluding the $77.4 million unfavorable FX impact, total Consumer net sales in 2015 increased $53.9 million, or 3.7%, as compared to 2014, primarily driven by higher net sales of Revlon color cosmetics, Mitchum anti-perspirant deodorant products, Revlon ColorSilk hair color and Cutex nail products, partially offset by lower net sales of Almay color cosmetics. Consumer segment net sales were negatively impacted in connection with the Company's exit of its business operations in Venezuela in the second quarter of 2015 and change to a distributor model, as such change resulted in $1.0 million of net sales in Venezuela in 2015, compared to $16.3 million of net sales in Venezuela in 2014. Excluding Venezuela, on an XFX basis, Consumer net sales would have increased by 4.4% in 2015, as compared to 2014.\nConsumer segment profit in 2015 was $360.2 million, an increase of $20.8 million, or 6.1%, as compared to $339.4 million in 2014. Excluding the $9.2 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, Consumer segment profit in 2015 increased $30.0 million, or 8.8%, as compared to 2014, primarily driven by higher gross profit as a result of the increases in net sales discussed above, partially offset by $8.7 million of higher brand support expenses for the Company's Consumer brands. In connection with the Company's exit of its business operations in Venezuela in the second quarter of 2015 and change to a distributor model, there was no profit in Venezuela in 2015, compared to $6.6 million of profit in Venezuela in 2014. Excluding Venezuela, on an XFX basis, Consumer segment profit would have increased by 11.1% in 2015, as compared to 2014.\nProfessional Segment\nProfessional segment net sales in 2016 were $476.5 million, a $5.4 million, or 1.1%, increase, as compared to $471.1 million in 2015. Excluding the $5.7 million unfavorable FX impact, total Professional net sales in 2016 increased by $11.1 million as compared to 2015. This increase was driven primarily by higher net sales of American Crew men's grooming products as a result of the Elvis Presley branded marketing campaign and Revlon Professional hair products in part due to the launch of Revlon Professional Be Fabulous and Revlonissimo Colorsmetique. These increases were partially offset by lower net sales of CND nail products.\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nProfessional segment profit in 2016 was $99.4 million, a $4.5 million, or 4.3%, decrease, as compared to $103.9 million in 2015, primarily driven by the absence in 2016 of a $3.0 million gain related to the sale of a non-core professional brand that was completed in 2015.\nProfessional segment net sales in 2015 were $471.1 million, a decrease of $31.6 million, or 6.3%, compared to $502.7 million in 2014. Excluding the $43.8 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, total Professional net sales increased by $12.2 million in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily as a result of higher net sales of American Crew men's grooming products, Revlon Professional hair products and Creme of Nature hair products, partially offset by lower net sales of CND nail products in the U.S.\nProfessional segment profit in 2015 was $103.9 million, a decrease of $0.9 million, or 0.9%, compared to $104.8 million in 2014. Excluding the $3.7 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, Professional segment profit increased $2.8 million in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to higher net sales, partially offset by $5.1 million of higher brand support expenses for the Company's Professional brands and a favorable adjustment in 2014 of $3.4 million related to the inventory obsolescence reserve, with no similar adjustment in 2015.\nElizabeth Arden Segment\nThe Elizabeth Arden segment is comprised of the operations acquired by the Company in the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, which closed on September 7, 2016. An analysis of net sales and segment profit for the Elizabeth Arden segment for 2016 is not included in this Form 10-K, as the Company does not have any comparable prior year's net sales or segment profit for the Elizabeth Arden segment.\nElizabeth Arden operations have historically been seasonal, with higher net sales generally occurring in the second half of the calendar year as a result of increased demand by retailers in anticipation of and during the holiday season. As a result, the operating results of the Elizabeth Arden segment following the Acquisition Date include the effects of seasonality.\nOther Segment\nOther segment net sales in 2016 were $26.3 million, a $2.1 million, or 7.4%, decrease, compared to $28.4 million in 2015. Excluding the $3.5 million unfavorable FX impact, total Other segment net sales in 2016 increased by $1.4 million, or 4.9%, compared to 2015. This increase was primarily driven by net sales associated with newly-acquired distribution rights in Europe.\nOther segment loss in 2016 was $2.7 million, a $4.1 million decrease, compared to a $1.4 million profit in 2015. This decrease was primarily driven by higher packaging and design expenses.\nGeographic Results:\nIn connection with changes that the organization made to its management reporting structure following the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, beginning with the third quarter of 2016, the Company has combined its former U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico operating regions into the North America region for reporting purposes. The Company has modified its net sales discussion to conform to management's procedures for reviewing the business, and, accordingly, the amounts for 2016, 2015 and 2014 have been restated to conform to this presentation.\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in

in 2015. Excluding the $2.0 million unfavorable FX impact, Consumer segment net sales in North America in 2016 decreased by $36.9 million, or 4.0%, as compared to 2015. This decrease was primarily driven by the results of softening trade conditions in core categories, which impacted Revlon color cosmetics and Almay color cosmetics, as well as increased competition impacting Revlon ColorSilk hair color. These decreases were partially offset by incremental net sales in connection with the Company completing the global consolidation of the Cutex nail care brand, as well as higher net sales of Revlon beauty tools.\nIn the Consumer segment, North America net sales in 2015 increased by $20.6 million, or 2.3%, to $921.3 million, as compared to $900.7 million in 2014. Excluding the $8.7 million unfavorable FX impact, Consumer segment net sales in North America\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nincreased by $29.3 million, or 3.3%, in 2015, as compared to 2014. This increase was primarily driven by higher net sales of Revlon color cosmetics, Mitchum anti-perspirant deodorant products and Revlon ColorSilk hair color, partially offset by lower net sales of Almay color cosmetics.\nInternational\nIn the Consumer segment, International net sales in 2016 increased by $13.9 million, or 2.8%, to $507.4 million, as compared to $493.5 million in 2015. Excluding the $32.7 million unfavorable FX impact, Consumer segment International net sales in 2016 increased by $46.6 million, or 9.4%, as compared to 2015. This increase was primarily driven by higher net sales of Revlon color cosmetics, Revlon ColorSilk hair color, as well as incremental net sales of Cutex nail care products. The increase in International net sales was mainly driven by higher net sales in Argentina, the U.K. and Mexico.\nIn the Consumer segment, International net sales in 2015 decreased by $44.1 million, or 8.2% to $493.5 million, as compared to $537.6 million in 2014. Excluding the $68.7 million unfavorable FX impact, Consumer segment International net sales increased by 24.6 million, or 4.6%, in 2015, as compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher net sales of Revlon color cosmetics. The Company's exit of its business operations in Venezuela in 2015 negatively impacted International net sales. Excluding Venezuela, on an XFX basis, International net sales would have increased by 10.0% in 2015, as compared to 2014.\nProfessional Segment\nNorth America\nIn the Professional segment, North America net sales in 2016 increased by $3.1 million, or 1.5%, to $204.9 million, as compared to $201.8 million in 2015. Excluding the $0.8 million unfavorable FX impact, Professional segment net sales in North America in 2016 increased on an XFX basis by $3.9 million, or 1.9%, as compared to 2015. This increase was primarily driven by increased net sales of American Crew men's grooming products as a result of the Elvis Presley branded marketing campaign as well as Creme of Nature hair products, partially offset by lower net sales of CND nail products.\nIn the Professional segment, North America net sales in 2015 decreased by $12.5 million, or 5.8%, to $201.8 million, as compared to $214.3 million in 2014. Excluding the $3.7 million unfavorable FX impact, Professional segment net sales in North America decreased on an XFX basis by $8.8 million, or 4.1%, in 2015, as compared to 2014. This decrease was primarily driven by lower net sales of CND nail products.\nInternational\nIn the Professional segment, International net sales in 2016 increased by $2.3 million, or 0.9%, to $271.6 million, as compared to $269.3 million in 2015. Excluding the $4.9 million unfavorable FX impact, Professional segment International net sales increased by $7.2 million, or 2.7%, in 2016, as compared to 2015. This increase was primarily due to higher net sales of Revlon Professional hair products, in part due to the launch of Revlon Professional Be Fabulous, as well as an increase in net sales of American Crew men's grooming products throughout most of the International region. These increases were partially offset by lower net sales of CND nail products.\nIn the Professional segment, International net sales in 2015 decreased by $19.1 million, or 6.6%, to $269.3 million, as compared to $288.4 million in 2014. Excluding the $40.1 million unfavorable FX impact, Professional segment International net sales in 2015 increased by $21.0 million, or 7.3%, as compared to 2014. This increase was primarily due to higher net sales of American Crew men's grooming products and Revlon Professional hair products throughout most of the International region.\nElizabeth Arden Segment\nThe Elizabeth Arden segment is comprised of the operations acquired by the Company in the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition which closed on September 7, 2016. Therefore, an analysis of net sales and segment profit for the Elizabeth Arden segment for 2016 is not included in this Form 10-K, as the Company does not have any comparable prior year's net sales or segment profit for the Elizabeth Arden segment.\nElizabeth Arden operations have historically been seasonal, with higher net sales generally occurring in the second half of the calendar year as a result of increased demand by retailers in anticipation of and during the holiday season. As a result, the operating results of the Elizabeth Arden segment following the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date include the effects of seasonality.\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nOther Segment\nNorth America\nThe Other segment consists of operations primarily within the International region.

The lower average debt outstanding was the result of: (i) regularly scheduled quarterly amortization payments made towards the Old Acquisition Term Loan through December 31, 2015; (ii) the favorable benefit to 2015 as a result of the May 1, 2014 prepayment of the remaining $58.4 million principal amount outstanding under the Non-Contributed Loan; and (iii) the $24.6 million March 2015 excess cash flow prepayment under the Old Term Loan Facility.
